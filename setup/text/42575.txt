Troubleshoot Java Lucene ignoring Field lucene For debugging Lucene, the best tool to use is Luke, which lets you poke around in the index itself to see what got indexed, carry out searches, etc. I recommend downloading it, pointing it at your index, and seeing what's in there. The section on "Why am I getting no hits?" in the Lucene FAQ has some suggestions you might find useful. You're using Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED, so no Analyzer will be used for indexing (I think). If you're using an Analyzer when you're searching then that might be the root of your problem - the indexing and searching Analyzers should be the same to make sure you get the right hits. Another simple thing to do would be to use a debugger or logging statement to check the value of StringUtils.objectToString(currClip.get("market_local")) to make sure it is what you think it is. Luke is bundled with Lucene, but you can tell Luke to use another version of Lucene. Say "lucene-core-2.1.0.jar" contains Lucene 2.1.0 that you want to use and "luke.jar" contains Luke with Lucene 2.3.0. Then you can start Luke with the following command. java -classpath lucene-core-2.1.0.jar;luke.jar org.getopt.luke.Luke (The trick is to put your version of Lucene before Luke on the classpath. Also, This is on Windows. On Unix, replace ";" with ":".) As you can check in Luke, +( market_local:Local ) gets rewritten to market_local:Local if the rewrite(IndexReader) method of the Query object is called. The two queries should be equivalent so there might be a bug in 2.1. If you have to use 2.1, you can try to manually call that method before passing the Query object to the IndexSearcher.
