Java + SQL Server - a viable solution? sql-server I don't know about Java and 2008... but you shouldn't have too much trouble with Java and SQL2000. As lubos suggested, you'd be doing yourself a favour to look at c# but if you're much more comfortable with Java then there shouldn't be any real limitations as the JDBC connector is supported by Microsoft I've worked on a project using MSQL Server in conjunction with a Java Stack. It works very well and as long, since JDBC shouldn't really care about your database. We used ehcache together with Hibernate and had problems with the MS JDBC Driver, so we switched to jtds and it works really good. It's quite a while ago, so you still might wanna give the MS driver a chance... We've been running an application using Hibernate talking to multiple remote MSQL Server instances for a few years now and we also switched to the jTDS driver early on after a few issues with the M$ driver. Since the switch we haven't had any issues at all. However, it's not a complicated application so it doesn't use any LOB's. Hope that helps. jTDS is excellent. I've been using it for years without issue in high-availability production environments. I would lean towards the jTDS driver. The MSSQL driver has a limitation where you cannot re-read the same column twice. This happens frequently when using Hibernate.
