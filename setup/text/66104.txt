Why does Tomcat 5.5 (with Java 1.4, running on Windows XP 32-bit) suddenly hang? windows tomcat It sounds like you're hitting a deadlock. If you can reproduce it in a dev environment then try attaching a debugger once it's happened. Take a look at your threads and see if you have any deadlocks. If you can't get a debugger to attach you should be able to generate a thread dump, as Dustin pointed out. For any jvm process, force a thread dump. In windows, this can be done with CTRL-BREAK, I believe, in the console window. In *nix, it is almost always "kill -3 jvm-pid". This may show if you have threads waiting on db connection pool/thread pool, etc. Another thing to check out is how many connections you have currently to the JVM -- either use NETSTAT or SysInternals utility such as tcpconn/tcpview (google it). Also, try to run with the verbose:gc JVM flag. For Sun's JVM, run like "java -verbose:gc". This will show your garbage collections. If it is collecting a lot (FULL COLLECTIONS, expecially) then you probably have a memory leak. The full collections are costly, especially on large heaps like that. How are you determining that only 300mb are being used? Try increasing the logging sensitivity for the Tomcat application server. http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/logging.html You can increase the sensitivity to FINEST or ALL for most of them for a few days and see if that helps you catch anything. I agree with creating multiple thread dumps and viewing them though this: Thread Dump Analyzer
