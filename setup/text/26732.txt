Invalid servlet mapping in Tomcat 6.0 tomcat servlets web.xml url-mapping <url-pattern>*NEXTEVENT*</url-pattern>
 The URL pattern is not valid. It can either end in an asterisk or start with one (to denote a file extension mapping). The url-pattern specification: A string beginning with a ‘/’ character and ending with a ‘/*’ suffix is used for path mapping. A string beginning with a ‘*.’ prefix is used as an extension mapping. A string containing only the ’/’ character indicates the "default" servlet of the application. In this case the servlet path is the request URI minus the context path and the path info is null. All other strings are used for exact matches only. See SRV.11.2 of the Java Servlet Specification Version 2.4 for more details. A workaround that can achieve that is to add a servlet filter to do URL re-writes e.g. re-write NEXTEVENT to /NEXTEVENT/(the one before the NEXTEVENT)/(the one after NEXTEVENT) or something similar.
