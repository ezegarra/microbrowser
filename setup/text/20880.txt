Java JPanel redraw issues swing Can you give us some more information on how you add the combo boxes to the JPanel? This is a pretty common thing to do in Swing so I doubt that it's a JVM issue but I guess anything is possible. Specifically, I would double check to make sure you're not accessing the GUI from any background threads. In this case, maybe you're reading the choices from a DB or something and updating the JComboBox from a background thread, which is a big no-no in Swing. See SwingUtils.invokeLater().
