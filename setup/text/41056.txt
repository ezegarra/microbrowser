Best java tools for emacs debugging emacs ide javadoc I've used JDEE on several projects. It handles Code Completion. I've never used it for debugging or browsing docs, but it's a big step up from a basic text editor. I've had good success with jdibug for debugging Java code with Emacs. For javadoc I found http://javadochelp.sourceforge.net/index.html to be the best. Exuberant ctags is your best friend when it comes to navigation.
