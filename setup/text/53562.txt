Enabling Hibernate second-level cache with JPA on JBoss 4.2 hibernate jpa caching I believe you need to add the cache annotations to tell hibernate how to use the second-level cache (read-only, read-write, etc). This was the case in my app (using spring / traditional hibernate and ehcache, so your mileage may vary). Once the caches were indicated, I started seeing messages that they were in use from hibernate. Follow-up: in the end, after adding annotations, I have it working with EhCache, i.e. <property name="hibernate.cache.provider_class" 
          value="net.sf.ehcache.hibernate.EhCacheProvider" />
