Struts 1.3: forward outside the application context? struts You can't "forward", in the strict sense. Just call sendRedirect() on the HttpServletResponse object in your Action class's execute() method. and, then 'return null'. alternately, either call setModule on the ActionForward object (that you are going to return) or set the path to an absolute URI I ended up doing response.sendRedirect(). If this was still in the web application, you could use ServletContext.RequestDispatcher? That's how the Struts doForward() method works. However, to go outside Struts/Java, you need the sendRedirect(). RequestDispatcher rd = getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher(uri);
rd.forward(request, response);
