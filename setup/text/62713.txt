Accessing a bean with a dot(.) in its ID spring spring-webflow spring-el This is a restriction of the EL parser (generally either OGNL or jboss-el for Spring Web Flow). EL uses dot notation for parsing the navigation chain,causing the initial behavior you describe (attempting to find the "bus" bean). In my experience, anything with a getter method can be accessed via dot notation. In your example, whatever object is being represented by the bus bean needs to have a getServiceFacade method and that the object returned by getServiceFacade would need to have a getSomeAction method. Try: ['bus.MyServiceFacade'].someAction() or 'bus.MyServiceFacade'.someAction() This may work, or it may not...but similar things are used in the Expression Language for JSPs. I was able to do this by using both the bean accessor (@) symbol and single-quotes around the name of the bean. Using your example: #{@'bus.MyServiceFacade'.someAction()}
