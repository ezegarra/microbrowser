Is it possible to get the maximum supported resolution of a connected display in os x from java? osx osx-leopard resolutions 	GraphicsDevice[] devices = GraphicsEnvironment.getLocalGraphicsEnvironment()
		.getScreenDevices();
	for (int i = 0; i < devices.length; i++) {
		GraphicsDevice dev = devices[i];
		System.out.println("device " + i);
		DisplayMode[] modes = dev.getDisplayModes();
		for (int j = 0; j < modes.length; j++) {
			DisplayMode m = modes[j];
			System.out.println(" " + j + ": " + m.getWidth() + " x " + m.getHeight());
		}
	}
 With this code you can determine the current resolution. On my system (SuSE linux) it does NOT output the possible resolutions. Seems to work an Mac and Windows.
