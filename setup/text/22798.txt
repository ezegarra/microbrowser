Drag and Drop an Email from MS Outlook to Eclipse RCP eclipse ms-office integration desktop I did make some headway on this sort of thing a few years back using Apache POI to extract the contents of an email from .msg files. I'm pretty sure they have a simple swing explorer / viewer that you can use to examine the structure within the compound document format, but I can't find it right now. I was able to extract most information that I was interested in but was ultimately wanting to create a mime format version of the message and couldn't extract all the information I needed in a format I could use. I assume that you've already ruled out the tools in "org.eclipse.swt.dnd" for some reason? There are some examples here on how to go about using them, in case you haven't. If what you really want to do is drag&drop, you're going to have to do some work with those tools. At that point, really the question becomes, what format is it in on the clipboard, vs in a file, and which is easier to integrate into your app. Maybe this is a solution for your problem: http://sourceforge.net/projects/javaoutlookdd/ It allows to handle outlook items like File objects during drag&drop.
