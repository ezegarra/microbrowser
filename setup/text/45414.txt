Why does the Eclipse code formatter break in a Javadoc @see tag? eclipse javadoc eclipse-3.4 I can only assume it's a bug in Eclipse. It only happens with @see tags, it happens also for all 3 builtin code formatter settings. There are some interesting bugs reported already in the neighbourhood, but I couldn't find this specific one. See for example a search for @see in the Eclipse Bugzilla. Strict XML specifications require that the self closing tags should have a space before the closing slash like so: <gcServer enabled="true" /> <!-- note the space just after "true" -->
 I can only assume, like Bart said, that there is a bug in Eclipse's reformatter that thinks the closing tag is actually a self-closing tag. Another idea: Can you verify that your a tags are balanced (i.e. no unclosed tags higher up in the document)? This could be a bug in Eclipse 3.4. I'm using 3.3 (M20080221-1800), and do not observe this behavior.
