What is a regex "independent capturing group"? regex It means that the grouping is atomic, and it throws away backtracking information for a matched group. So, this expression is possessive; it won't back off even if doing so is the only way for the regex as a whole to succeed. It's "independent" in the sense that it doesn't cooperate, via backtracking, with other elements of the regex to ensure a match. if you have (foo(?>co)*co), that will never match. im sure there are practical examples of when this would be useful, try the o'reilly book. (?>X)[?/*/+] is the same as (?:X)[?/*/+]+.
