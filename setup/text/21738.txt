Problems running Swing application with IDEA 8M1 swing ide jvm intellij-idea IDEA 8 Milestone 1 is a beta(ish) "based on a new platform". This may have changed the way that swing is handled. Also you are running a beta JDK. You will probably get more help/submit a bug at the Jetbrain forums unless they are on SO also. Here is the bug tracker link Ask your question directly on the IDEA website. They always react fast and the problem you have is probably either fixed or documented. I have actually experienced problems from using the JDK 6u10 beta myself and had to downgrade to JDK 6u7 for the time being. This solved some of my problems with among other things swing. Also, i have been running IJ8M1 since the 'release' and I am very satisfied with it, especially if you regard the "beta" tag. It feels snappier and also supports multiple cores which makes my development machine rejoice. ;p Anyway, i use WinXP32 and IJ8M1 with JDK 6u7 and that is afaik very stable indeed.
