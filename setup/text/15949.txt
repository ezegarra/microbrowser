Java+Tomcat, Dying database connection? mysql tomcat Tomcat Documentation DBCP uses the Jakarta-Commons Database Connection Pool. It relies on number of Jakarta-Commons components: * Jakarta-Commons DBCP
* Jakarta-Commons Collections
* Jakarta-Commons Pool
 This attribute may help you out. removeAbandonedTimeout="60"
 I'm using the same connection pooling stuff and I'm setting these properties to prevent the same thing it's just not configured through tomcat. But if the first thing doesn't work try these. testWhileIdle=true
timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis=300000
 I do not know whether the above answer does basically the same thing, but some of our systems use the DB connection about once a week and I've seen that we provide a -Otimeout flag or something of that sort to mysql to set the connection timeout. Just to clarify what is actually causing this. MySQL by default terminates open connections after 8 hours of inactivity. However the database connection pool will retain connections for longer than that. So by setting timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis=300000 you are instructing the connection pool to run through connections and evict and close idle ones every 5 minutes. The removeAbandoned option is deprecated as of DBCP 1.2 (though still present in the 1.3 branch). Here's a non-official explanation.
