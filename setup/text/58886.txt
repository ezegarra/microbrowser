Drilling down in VisualVM visualvm Does your App use RMI over TCP? If not, is it possible that this is a heisenbug, caused by instrumenting the VM? I assume VisualVM must use RMI calls to figure out what's going on in the JVM.... I don't have experience with VisualVM -- but JRockit's profiler does provide this information; you may consider using it instead. Update: a question with a list of java profilers can be found here I have started using the new VisualVM 1.2. It allows profiling CPU and drilling down using a call graph. Try it out. Using 1.3.2 also seeing this being the reported hangup I am hitting. In 1.3.2 if you do a thread dump and look for this call you can see where it lands in the call chain for that thread. Not sure if Yuval F was referring to this or something else. Look up the call chain to see what it's calling and so on, look down to see what it's being called by and so on.
