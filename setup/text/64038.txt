Setting java locale settings locale You could call during init or whatever Locale.setDefault() or -Duser.language=, -Duser.country=, and -Duser.variant= at the command line. Here's something on Sun's site. I believe java gleans this from the environment variables in which it was launched, so you'll need to make sure your LANG and LC_* environment variables are set appropriately. The locale manpage has full info on said environment variables. One way to control the locale settings is to set the java system properties user.language and user.region. With the user.language, user.country and user.variant properties. Example: java -Duser.language=th -Duser.country=TH -Duser.variant=TH SomeClass If you are on Mac, simply using System Preferences -> Languages and dragging the language to test to top (before English) will make sure the next time you open the App, the right locale is tried!! I had to control this in a script that ran on a machine with French locale, but a specific Java program had to run with en_US. As already pointed out, the following works: java -Duser.language=en -Duser.country=US ...
 Alternatively, LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 java ...
 I prefer the latter. You can change on the console: $ export LANG=en_US.utf8
 For tools like jarsigner which is implemented in Java. JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Duser.language=en jarsigner
