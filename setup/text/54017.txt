What are the best Java podcasts? podcast I just found JavaPosse, which is basically a Java-related newscast Also, this question is kind of related, though it isn't java-specific. javaworld JavaPosse Java Mobility Sun Developer Network Informit Java podcasts JavaPosse is pretty much the "de facto" one that everyone I work / interact with listens to, so I'd 2nd pkaeding's suggestion Another vote here for the Java Posse. The four hosts are all guys that have worked for companies like Google, Apple, and Sun. Not only are they experienced, but they have a good rapport which makes for an entertaining program. Also I enjoy listening to this show despite the fact that I barely use any of the technologies that they spend the majority of time talking about. It has to be the Java Posse. If you want to find the answer to something, look back through their back catalogue. They've probably talked to the person responsible at some point. Episode 200 was a good overview of this for those new to them. Also check out their google group for discussions and Q&A. Oh, and then there's their Open Spaces Conference... (I'm a fan you might have guessed) I would also add software engineering radio. This postcast is not explicitly java centric. But I think it rather java focussed... I listen to the Grails Podcast. It covers Grails and Groovy news. Groovy is a dynamic language which targets the JVM. It can compile Java as well as itself. So, some of the libraries discussed on the podcast are built on plain ol' Java. It's an informative show but I wish its audio engineer would spend more time leveling out the volume. I second jbandi with Software Engineering Radio. One episode I really loved was on Software Architects. I heard it about a week after Joel and Jeff did a podcast about what a waste Software Architects are. It made it very clear that you have to consider that just because you never needed a Software Architect, that under different circumstances, that's what you might really need.
