Looking for terracotta examples cluster-computing terracotta Just my tiny cent: I read alot about EC2 and terracotta often come up. Stuff like this: http://blog.decaresystems.ie/index.php/2007/02/12/amazon-web-services-the-future-of-datacenter-computing-part-2/ EDIT: Note that EC2 now is offering persistent storage which should help alot with this terracotta stuff. This example got me interested in terracotta, http://www.terracotta.org/confluence/display/~jboner/Build+a+POJO-based+Data+Grid+Using+Open+Terracotta Which gives plenty of code examples to get you started The Apress book "The Definitive Guide to Terracotta" (to which I contributed) has a chapter on Master/Worker with an extended example. Jonas Boner (mentioned above) is the primary author of that chapter. This page links to places to buy, a free chapter, and all the example code which is available for free: http://terracotta.org/web/display/orgsite/The+Definitive+Guide The Master/Worker stuff from the book has since been refined and is available as a Terracotta Integration Module on the Terracotta Forge at: http://forge.terracotta.org/releases/projects/tim-messaging/ Not sure this is of interest to you, since they are much smaller in scope, but the Terracotta.org web site provides a number of ready to go "recipes" that demonstrate a number of concepts Terracotta: Terracotta.org Recipes (code samples)
