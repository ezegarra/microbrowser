How do I read and write raw ip packets from java on a mac? osx networking TINI is a java ethernet controller, which may have libraries and classes for directly accessing data from ethernet frames to TCP streams. You may be able to find something in there that implements your needed classes. If not, there should be pointers or user groups that will give you a head start. If you start with the idea that you need something like a packet sniffer, you'll want to look at http://netresearch.ics.uci.edu/kfujii/jpcap/doc/. Raw Socket for Java is a request for JDK for a looong long time. See the request here. There's a long discussion there where you can look for workarounds and solutions. I once needed this for a simple PING operation, but I can't remember how I resolved this. Sorry :) My best bet so far seems to be the BPF api and to write a thin JNI wrapper You can't access raw sockets from pure Java, so you will need some sort of layer between your Java code and the network interfaces. Also note that access to raw sockets is normally only available to "root" processes, since otherwise any user could both a) sniff all traffic, and b) generate spoofed packets. Rather than write your whole program so that it needs to run as "root", you might consider having the packet capture and generation done in a standalone program with some sort of IPC (RMI, named pipe, TCP socket, etc) to exchange the data with your Java app.
