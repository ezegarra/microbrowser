How to export findbugs results from Eclipse findbugs plugin? eclipse-plugin findbugs Findbugs dumps its results into an XML file in your workspace's .metadata folder. Look for the subfolder that's named something like findbugs. You can also download a standalone version of Findbugs that will save the results wherever you like. Once you have the results file, you might be able to import from XML to Excel and filter there. Alternatively, you can use XSLT to transform to several CSV files and open them in Excel. I had the same problem with findbugs some versions ago. I updated the plugin today to version 1.3.8 and found out that you can now export and even import reports as XML directly. All you have to do is right-click on a project either in the package explorer or in the findbugs "Bug explorer" and select "Findbugs->Save XML" or "Findbugs->Load XML". Finely a proper export and import functionality for a fantastic tool. Btw, I use Eclipse 3.3.2.
