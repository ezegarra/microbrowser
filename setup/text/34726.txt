Trouble using JRun to Host Java Servlets servlets hosting jrun This is probably going to be difficult to resolve unless you post either the error message from the log file or the list of steps that you took so far. I have JRun 3.1 configured on my machine so maybe I can duplicate your issue if you give us more information. Jrun development has pretty much stopped. You should look into running another application server. Jboss or Glassfish are good alternatives. I didn't know JRun was even still in existence since 1999 or something like that. Anyway, Tomcat or Jetty would be my easy replacements. Tomcat for its scriptability from ANT etc and Jetty for its pure simplicity (start an instance in 5 lines of code!). Glassfish is a huge system with many components, if you just want to host vanilla servlets and JSPs etc. then I would go for one of the above.
