What is causing a JVMTI_ERROR_NULL_POINTER? jvm I'm guessing you are using a native-code–based database driver (JDBC driver type 1 or 2). And I'm guessing that driver is buggy. If you could provide more information about the driver and your datasource configuration or connection string, it might help determine some answers. JVMTI is the debugging and profiling protocol. So, I'm guessint it's something peculiar to the environment you are attempting to run your application in. I'm with Tom on this one, it looks like your debugger / JVMTI agent is passing a NULL value to the JVM through the JVMTI interface. This particular error is probably not a problem with your application code.
