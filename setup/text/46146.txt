What are the Java regular expressions for matching IPv4 and IPv6 strings? regex public static final String IPV4_REGEX = "\\A(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\\d|[0-1]?\\d?\\d)(\\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\\d|[0-1]?\\d?\\d)){3}\\z";
public static final String IPV6_HEX4DECCOMPRESSED_REGEX = "\\A((?:[0-9A-Fa-f]{1,4}(?::[0-9A-Fa-f]{1,4})*)?) ::((?:[0-9A-Fa-f]{1,4}:)*)(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\\d|[0-1]?\\d?\\d)(\\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\\d|[0-1]?\\d?\\d)){3}\\z";
public static final String IPV6_6HEX4DEC_REGEX = "\\A((?:[0-9A-Fa-f]{1,4}:){6,6})(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\\d|[0-1]?\\d?\\d)(\\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\\d|[0-1]?\\d?\\d)){3}\\z";
public static final String IPV6_HEXCOMPRESSED_REGEX = "\\A((?:[0-9A-Fa-f]{1,4}(?::[0-9A-Fa-f]{1,4})*)?)::((?:[0-9A-Fa-f]{1,4}(?::[0-9A-Fa-f]{1,4})*)?)\\z";
public static final String IPV6_REGEX = "\\A(?:[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}:){7}[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}\\z";
 Got these from some blog. Someone good w/ regexes should be able to come up with a single regex for all IPv6 address types. Actually, I guess you could have a single regex that matches both IPv4 and IPv6. Here's a regex to match IPv4 addresses: \b(?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.){3}(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\b
 You'll need to escape the backslashes when you specify it as a string literal in Java: "\\b(?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\\.){3}(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\\b"
 Another good option for processing IPs is to use Java's classes Inet4Address and Inet6Address, which can be useful in a number of ways, one of which is to determine the validity of the IP address. I know this doesn't answer the question directly, but just thought it's worth mentioning. The regex allows the use of leading zeros in the IPv4 parts. Some Unix and Mac distros convert those segments into octals. I suggest using 25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|1\d\d|[1-9]?\d as an IPv4 segment.
