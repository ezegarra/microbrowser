How do you get the ethernet address using Java? networking ethernet You can get the address that connects to your ServerSocket using http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/net/NetworkInterface.html#getInetAddresses() However if your client is connecting via a NAT, then you will get the address of the router and NOT the Ethernet address. If it is on your local network (via a hub/switch, no router with NAT) the it wil work as intended. java.net.NetworkInterface.getHardwareAddress (method added in Java 6) It has to be called on the machine you are interested in - the MAC is not transferred across network boundaries (i.e. LAN and WAN). If you want to make use of it on a website server to interrogate the clients, you'd have to run an applet that would report the result back to you. For Java 5 and older I found code parsing output of command line tools on various systems. Actually, beyond other right answers (JDK 6; exec 'ifconfig'), there are JNI-based libraries. Java Uuid Generator (JUG) 2.0 has code for some platforms. This works on JDK 1.2 and above at least (maybe 1.1 even)
