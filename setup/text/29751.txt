How can I make this code to submit a UTF-8 form textarea with jQuery/Ajax work? jquery ajax jsp encoding have you tried adding the following before the call : $.ajaxSetup({ 
	scriptCharset: "utf-8" , 
	contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8"
});
 The options are explained here. contentType : When sending data to the server, use this content-type. Default is "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", which is fine for most cases. scriptCharset : Only for requests with 'jsonp' or 'script' dataType and GET type. Forces the request to be interpreted as a certain charset. Only needed for charset differences between the remote and local content. I had the same problem and fixed it by downgrading to mysql-connector-odbc-3.51.16. I had the same problem also and I fixed it in this way: In PHP, before storing the data in the database, I used the htmlentities() function. And during showing the data, I used the html_entity_decode() function. This worked. I strongly hope this will work for you too. I'm having the same problem. I saw Internet Explorer 8 sends this header: content-type = application/x-www-form-urlencoded
 while Firefox sends this: content-type = application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
 My solution was just forcing in jQuery to use the Firefox content-type: $.ajaxSetup({ scriptCharset: "utf-8" ,contentType: "application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8" });
 I see this problem a lot. The meta doesn't work always in your PHP data operations, so just type this at the beginning: <?php header('Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8');  ?>
 As the exception is a jdbc error, your best approach is to capture the input before it is sent to the database. java.sql.BatchUpdateException: Incorrect string value: '\xF1a' for column 'body' at row 1 A single character is causing the exception. It may be the case that you will need to override some characters manually. You will find, when working with non-latin-alphabet languages (as I do), that this is a common pain.
