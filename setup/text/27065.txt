Tool to read and display Java .class versions I recommend: DJ Java Decompiler. It's free to try and costs $19.99 to purchase. I've also heard good things about Cavaj, but never used it personally. It's freeware, so definitely worth a try. As far as searching for the files, I have it integrated with my eclipse setup. With my configuration, when I click on a .java file it opens in eclipse and when I click on a .class file, it opens in DJ Java Decompiler. It is easy enough to read the class file signature and get these values without a 3rd party API. All you need to do is read the first 8 bytes. ClassFile {
    u4 magic;
    u2 minor_version;
    u2 major_version;
 For class file version 51.0 (Java 7), the opening bytes are: CA FE BA BE 00 00 00 33
 ...where 0xCAFEBABE are the magic bytes, 0x0000 is the minor version and 0x0033 is the major version. import java.io.*;

public class Demo {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    ClassLoader loader = Demo.class.getClassLoader();
    try (InputStream in = loader.getResourceAsStream("Demo.class");
        DataInputStream data = new DataInputStream(in)) {
      if (0xCAFEBABE != data.readInt()) {
        throw new IOException("invalid header");
      }
      int minor = data.readUnsignedShort();
      int major = data.readUnsignedShort();
      System.out.println(major + "." + minor);
    }
  }
}
 Walking directories (File) and archives (JarFile) looking for class files is trivial. Oracle's Joe Darcy's blog lists the class version to JDK version mappings up to Java 7: Target   Major.minor
1.1      45.3
1.2      46.0
1.3      47.0
1.4      48.0
5 (1.5)  49.0
6 (1.6)  50.0
7 (1.7)  51.0
8 (1.8)  52.0
 Use the javap tool that comes with the JDK. The -verbose option will print the version number of the class file. > javap -verbose MyClass
Compiled from "MyClass.java"
public class MyClass
  SourceFile: "MyClass.java"
  minor version: 0
  major version: 46
...
 To only show the version: WINDOWS> javap -verbose MyClass | find "version"
LINUX  > javap -verbose MyClass | grep version
 If you are on a unix system you could just do a find /target-folder -name \*.class | xargs file | grep "version 50\.0"
 (my version of file says "compiled Java class data, version 50.0" for java6 classes). On Unix-like file /path/to/Thing.class Will give the file type and version as well. Here is what the output looks like: compiled Java class data, version 49.0 I found this one very useful to understand the version in byte code. http://javapapers.com/core-java/how-to-find-java-the-compiler-target-version-from-a-java-class-file/ Yet another java version check od -t d -j 7 -N 1 ApplicationContextProvider.class | head -1 | awk '{print "Java", $2 - 44}'
