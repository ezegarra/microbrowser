Charting library for Java and .Net .net charts Have you looking into using JFreeChart. I have used it on a few Java projects and its very configurable. Its free but I think you can purchase the developers guide for $50. Its good for quick simple charts too. However performance for real-time data is not quite up to par (Check out the FAQ). They also have a port to .NET however I have never used it. Hope that helps. ChartDirector is fantastic and supports more than just Java and .NET.

You could also try Open Flash Charts ChartFX (http://www.softwarefx.com) has been a leader in charting for years. I personally have used several different versions for over 8 years and it is rock solid. I have re-evaluated charting options periodically, and ChartFX has won in my environment based almost purely on feature set. It is not free or cheap, but it is well worth the price they charge. -Geoffrey Here is a belated answer: Use the Google Chart API. It will allow you to create charts in a programming language and platform agnostic way -- assuming your app will have an Internet connection at all times. Use it in combination with .Net and Java wrapper APIs that you can find here. I wrote one: charts4j.
