Small modification to an XML document using StAX xml stax After a bit of mucking around, the answer seems to be to use the Event reader/writer versions rather than the Stream versions. (i.e. javax.xml.stream.XMLEventReader and javax.xml.stream.XMLEventWriter) See also http://www.devx.com/tips/Tip/37795, which is what finally got me moving. StAX works pretty well and is very fast. I used it in a project to parse XML files which are up to 20MB. I don't have a thorough analysis, but it was definitely faster than SAX. As for your question: The difference between streaming and event-handling, AFAIK is control. With the streaming API you can walk through your document step by step and get the contents you want. Whereas the event-based API you can only handle what you are interested in. I know this is rather old question, but if anyone else is looking for something like this, there is another alternative: Woodstox Stax2 extension API has method: XMLStreamWriter2.copyEventFromReader(XMLStreamReader2 r, boolean preserveEventData) 
 which copies the currently pointed-to event from stream reader using stream writer. This is not only simple but very efficient. I have used it for similar modifications with success. (how to get XMLStreamWriter2 etc? All Woodstox-provided instances implement these extended versions -- plus there are wrappers in case someone wants to use "basic" Stax variants, as well)
