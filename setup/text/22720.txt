Configure a Java Socket to fail-fast on disconnect? exception sockets networking Set a short timeout? Does isOutputShutdown() not get you what you want? You could always build a SocketWatcher class that spins up in its own Thread and repeatedly tries to write empty strings to the Socket until that raises a SocketClosedException. Set a different thread to reading from the socket. It will block until the socket is closed, and then an exception will be thrown. Catch that exception to detect the close immediately. The only reliable way to detect a broken connection in TCP is to write to it, which will eventually cause a 'connection reset' IOException. However due to buffering it won't happen on the first write after the disconnection,p but on a subsequent write. You can't do anything about this.
