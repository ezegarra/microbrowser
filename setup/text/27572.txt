JavaServiceWrapper on 64bit linux, any problems? daemon From http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/doc/english/introduction.html : Binary distributions are provided for the following list of platforms and are available on the download page. Only OS versions which are known to work have been listed. (snip...) linux - Linux kernels; 2.2.x 2.4.x, 2.6.x. Known to work with Debian and Red Hat, but should work with any distribution. Currently supported on both 32 and 64-bit x86, and 64-bit ppc systems. I've had it running in production on 64-bit red hat without any trouble for the last year or so. Take a look at http://yajsw.sourceforge.net/. It's free and rather compatible reimplementation of TanukiSoftware Java Service Wrapper featuring free 64-bit support.
