How can I permanently have line numbers in IntelliJ? intellij-idea android-studio In IntelliJ 8.1.2 this option has moved. It's now in File | Settings. Within the "IDE Settings" section of that dialog, you'll find it under Editor | Appearance. Hello this is Tim from the FUTURE!!! 2011... For 9.0.4 File > Settings In the tree view group ------------IDE Settings --------- Click the Editor [+] Select Appearance... Its there. There's another way, and even quicker (works for me in version 10.5) Simply right click on the place where the line-numbers should be, and there you'll see a small menu. then, mark the "Show Line Numbers" option. Please note that this only works on a per-file basis, however. Enjoy. For InteliJ IDEA 11.0 and above Goto File --> Settings in the Settings window Editor --> Appearance and tick Show line numbers check box. On Mac Intellij 12.1.2 there is no File-Settings: There is an application-name menu item to the left of "File" with a "preferences" menu item: and within that is the "Settings" dialog shown by the Windows Intellij. On IntelliJ 12 on MAC OSX, I had a hard time finding it. The search wouldn't show me the way for some reason. Go to Preferences and under IDE Settings, Editor, Appearance and select 'Show line numbers' In Intellij 13 the layout has changed, the Settings button can only be found in File -> Settings and not in the toolbars, and from there you follow the same steps: Editor -> Appearance -> Show line numbers, or search for Line numbers in the Settings search input.
