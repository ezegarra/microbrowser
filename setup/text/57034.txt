jQuery and Java applets javascript jquery applet For the first issue, how about trying alert( $("#applet-id")[0].foo() );
 For the second issue here is a thread with a possible workaround. Quoting the workaround // Prevent memory leaks in IE
// And  prevent errors on refresh with events  like mouseover in other  browsers
// Window isn't included so as not to unbind existing unload events
jQuery(window).bind("unload",
function() {
        jQuery("*").add(document).unbind();
});
 change that code to: // Window isn't included so as not to unbind existing unload events
jQuery(window).bind("unload",
function() {
        jQuery("*:not('applet, object')").add(document).unbind();
});
