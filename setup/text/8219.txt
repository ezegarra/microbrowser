Test Distribution testing enterprise I've seen some people having a play with distributed JUnit. I can't particularly vouch for how effective it is, but the other teams I've seen seemed to think it was straight forward enough. Hope that helps. Our build people use Mozilla Tinderbox. It seems to have some hooks for distributed testing. I'm sorry not to know the details but I thought I would at least pass on the pointer to you. It's also nice coz you can find out immediately when a build breaks, and what checkin might have been the culprit. http://www.mozilla.org/tinderbox.html There's also parallel-junit. Depending on how you currently execute your tests its convenience may vary - the idea is just to multithread on a single system that has multiple cores. I've played with it briefly, but it's a change from how we currently run our tests. Hudson, the continuous integration engine I use, also has some ways to distribute test running (separate jobs aggregated results in one).
