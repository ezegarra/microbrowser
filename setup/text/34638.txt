data 'security' with java and hibernate security hibernate java-ee Hibernate has a filter mechanism that may work for you. The filters will rewrite the queries hibernate generates to include an additional clause to limit the rows returned. I'm not aware of anything in hibernate to mask/hide columns. Your database may also have support for this functionality. Oracle, for example, has the Virtual Private Database (VPD) which will rewrite your queries at the database level. This solution has the added benefit that any external program (e.g. reporting tools) that goes against your db will have your security restrictions enforced. VPD also has support to mask restricted columns with NULLs. Unfortunately, the above solutions have not been adequate to support the security requirements for the types projects I typically work on. There is usually some sort of context that cannot be easily expressed in the above solutions. For example, users can view data that they have created, or that have been been marked as public, or belong to a project which they manage. We typically create query/finder/DAO objects where we pass in the values required to enforce the security and then create the query accordingly. I hope this helps When using Hibernate filters you need to be aware that the additional restrictions will not be applied to SQL statements generted by the load() or get() methods.
