Best iCalendar library for Java? icalendar ical I had limited success with iCal4j on a project last year. It seems to be a fairly popular choice for ical work in the java community. If I remember correctly the API can be slightly confusing at first glance. However It's pretty solid in the long run. Good luck, Brian A challenger appears! Please give biweekly a try. I'm looking for lots of feedback on how it can be improved.
