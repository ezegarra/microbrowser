What are some good examples of a WS-Eventing client in Java? web-services ws-eventing Check out Apache Savan. It's a publisher/subscriber implementation for Axis2 that supports WS-Eventing (see sample.eventing.Client for an example client). JBossWS has some information about setting up a service here, but I didn't see any example for a client. Regarding CXF and Metro, I'm not sure if they have specific support for WS-Eventing yet.
