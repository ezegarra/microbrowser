What HTML parsing libraries do you recommend in Java html parsing html-content-extraction I have tried HTML Parser which is dead simple. Do you need to do a full parse of the HTML? If you're just looking for specific values within the contents (a specific tag/param), then a simple regular expression might be enough, and could very well be faster. NekoHTML, TagSoup, and JTidy will allow you to parse HTML and then process with XML tools, like XPath.
