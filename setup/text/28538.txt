Java import/export dependencies import export I think you can get that information using JDepend You could use the Outbound dependencies feature of DependencyFinder. You can do that entirely in the GUI, or in command line exporting XML. There's a tool called JarAnalyzer that will give you the dependencies between the jars in a directory. It'll also give you a list of dependencies that don't exist in the directory. If it's a public jar (as in, not yours) then it might be in the Maven Repository.
