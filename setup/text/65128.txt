track down file handle logging file java-ee websphere Have you tried looking in your app server config? In JBoss, look in %JBOSS_HOME%/server/%INSTANCE_DIR%/conf/jboss-log4j.xml. Formally SysInternal's, now Microsoft's Process Explorer http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx "Find" menu item -> "Find Handle or DLL..." SysInternals may not help with Java class IO. Try getting a thread dump of the JVM (e.g., kill -3) while these logs are being written to. You should be able to catch a thread red handed with java.io packages near the top of the stack trace. Try placing a breakpoint in the File class' constructors and the mkdir and createNewFile methods. Generally, code will use the File class to create its files or directories. You should have the Java source code for these classes included with your JVM. Add "-Dlog4j.debug" to the command line and there will be extra info in standard output about how it is configured.
