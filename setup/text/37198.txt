What is the best way to get OS specific information in Java? environment-variables My docs would probably best be handled by accessing: System.getProperty("user.home");
 Look up the docs on System.getProperty. Any information you can get about the user's environment can be fetched from System.getProperty("...");
 For a list of what you can get, take a look here: http://mgrand.home.mindspring.com/java-system-properties.htm I don't think you'll be able to get the path you require (the All Users path) in an OS dependent way. After all - do other operating systems have an equivalent? Your best bet is to probably inspect: System.getProperty("os.name");
 to see if you are running Windows and then if so use "C:\Documents & Settings\All Users\". But you'll be better off just constantly using System.getProperty("user.home");
 (as mentioned by other people) throughout the application. Or alternatively, allow the user to specify the directory to store whatever it is you want to store. Specifically getting on Windows the "..\Documents & Settings\All Users, basicaly any path that needs the front end to be dynamically derived based on the OS your software is running on. (Now I need the answer to this) The folders below the All Users dir are variable directories in windows. Details can be found in the document about KNOWNFOLDERIDs (CSIDL in older versions). Because this values are system dependent Java does not provide a way to access the values. I think there is in general no equivalent on other operating systems to this windows specific folder. In addition the folder Documents & Settings\All Users is only present in latest windows versions and things are handled differently for e.g Windows 2000 or XP I think. If you really need this information you should read the microsoft docs and impement a native library or some script invoked by Runtime.exec to provide the information to your java application.
