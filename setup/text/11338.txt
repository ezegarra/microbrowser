Getting Java and TWAIN to play together nicely jni twain image-scanner hm. I might have some homebrew available for it somewhere I could check, but for now: At our company, we basically gave up on this issue and implemented an (unfortunately win only) ActiveX solution: http://www.chestysoft.com/ximage/default.asp. /mp Calling the TWAIN API from anything except C/C++ is going to be a major pain, it relies entirely on complicated C structures that you have to replicate exactly in memory. If you need only fairly basic scanning, you could use something like https://github.com/twall/jna/ to call my old free 'EZTwain Classic' DLL (google for eztw32.dll) Great solution with working Java applet example: Found here I've actually purchased the chestysoft activeX control. Been using it for about 3 years. Works great but as with all ActiveX you are restricted to IE. And this one is 32-bit only. I'm looking into a flash approach now. Since flash can capture from a camera why not from a scanner. If I remember I'll report back what I find.
