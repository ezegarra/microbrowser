Install-base of Java JRE? deployment I'm not aware of anyone who keeps track of this publicly on a regular basis (unlike Adobe who pushes it every chance they get). The closest that I could come was this article from last November. Based upon his site, this data could be skewed a bit, but I think we fairly similar numbers as well. There is a very rough percentage of browsers with some JRE available at The Counter, though I wouldn't trust it. Sun has a few useful stats from 2007, but their stats from 2008 are much less detailed. They suggest that in 2007 "92%...of JRE installs...are now Java SE 6", but who knows what highly technical site they surveyed to get that number.
