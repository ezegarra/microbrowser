Java Time Zone is messed up linux timezone Hmm... off by one hour. DST possibly? Is the date set correctly? What version of the JDK is this running on? ("java -version") It's a "quirk" in the way the JVM looks up the zoneinfo file. See Bug ID 6456628. The easiest workaround is to make /etc/localtime a symlink to the correct zoneinfo file. For Pacific time, the following commands should work: # sudo cp /etc/localtime /etc/localtime.dist # sudo ln -fs /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Los_Angeles /etc/localtime I haven't had any problems with the symlink approach. Edit: Added "sudo" to the commands. It may help to double-check the timezone rules your OS is using. /usr/bin/zdump -v /etc/localtime | less This file should contain your daylight savings rules, like this one for the year 2080: /etc/localtime  Sun Mar 31 01:00:00 2080 UTC = Sun Mar 31 02:00:00 2080 BST isdst=1 gmtoff=3600 You can compare this with the timezone rules you think you should be using. They can be found in /usr/share/zoneinfo/. I had a similar issue, possibly the same one. However my tomcat server runs on a windows box so the symlink solution will not work. I set "-Duser.timezone=Australia/Sydney" in the JAVA_OPTS however tomcat would not recognize that DST was in effect. As a workaround i changed Australia/Sydney (+10 GMT) to Pacific/Numea (+11 GMT) so that times would correctly display however i would love to know the actual solution or bug, if any. On Ubuntu, it's not enough to just change the /etc/localtime file. It seems to read /etc/timezone file, too. It's better follow the instruction to set the time zone properly. In particular, do the following: $ sudo cp /etc/timezone /etc/timezone.dist
$ echo "Australia/Adelaide" | sudo tee /etc/timezone
Australia/Adelaide
$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure --frontend noninteractive tzdata

Current default time zone: 'Australia/Adelaide'
Local time is now:      Sat May  8 21:19:24 CST 2010.
Universal Time is now:  Sat May  8 11:49:24 UTC 2010.
 On my Ubuntu, if /etc/localtime and /etc/timezone are inconsistent, Java seems to read default time zone from /etc/timezone .
