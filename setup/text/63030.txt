BufferedImage in IKVM .net bufferedimage ikvm notimplementedexception The AWT code in IKVM is fairly easy to read and edit. I'd recommend you look for the methods that you are using that throw that exception, and then implement them. I've done this several times before with IKVM's AWT implementation and found it easy to do for background/server related functions. Its much less usable if your app is a desktop app, however.
