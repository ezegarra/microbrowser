Any good java source code analyzing and modifying libraries? source-code static-analysis I don't have any great advice for you, but I wanted to point out that there are a couple of Java 1.5 grammars for Antlr available already on their grammar list. You might also want to take a look at the Eclipse source. They should have a very robust parser, and they already have code transformations (refactorings) built-in, so you'll have some valuable example code. You can use eclipse jdt. Its core there is a powerful parser and compiler. I think it is hard to set up if you are not used to eclipse plugin development. An alternative is Spoon. I use this Framework to parse and process .java files. I think it can handle the same problem domain as JaxMeJS. But it is newer and well maintained (very good mailing list!). You can either process your input files manually or develop so called Spoonlets, which gives you the power of AOP to code transformation. What you want is a program transformation system. Our DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit is just such a system, with robust parsers (and unparsers) for Java, C#, C,C++, Python, COBOL, PHP and many more languages. Trust me, you don't want to repeat the effort it takes just to build the robust langauge front ends, let alone the machinery underneath that makes it possible to automate the modification of code. For more details on this, see my essay on Life After Parsing.
