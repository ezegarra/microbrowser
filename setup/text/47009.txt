What languages support covariance on inherited methods' return types? c# oop programming-languages covariance Any dynamic languages, of course -- Python, Ruby, Smalltalk, Javascript, etc. but I think thats what I'm asking for..or is it? I frankly don't know what you're asking. Java apparently has the same support for return-type covariance as C#, so if whatever you're looking for is lacking in C#, it's lacking in Java also. Basically what I'm asking is what languages support what I'm trying to do here. Does C# let you specify different data types for the get() and set() methods? If not, I would split them into actual Leg get_leg() and set_leg(DogLeg) functions. Otherwise one of two things will happen: 1) overspecification of get_leg() 2) underspecification of set_leg(). C++ supports covariant return types. C++ Java REALbasic Eiffel Sather Modula-3 Java added support for this in 1.5. It will not compile in earlier versions. As pointed out by Ivan Hamilton and Mat Noguchi, C++ supports the feature. But note that covariant return types are broken for template classes which inherit from some base in MSVC 7.X through 9.X (and probably 6 also). You get error C2555.
