experience with java clustering? cluster-computing terracotta jgroups Jboss clustering was very easy to get up and running. It seems to work well for us. You might want to take a look at Hazelcast. It is super lite, easy and free clustering platform with cluster API. If you are clustering your application state/data, Hazelcast can be great help with its distributed/partitioned, queue, map, set, list and lock implementations. Regards, -talip http://www.hazelcast.com JBossCache is a standalone open source project that JbossClustering makes use of in the Application Server. Our company made use of it in our own custom network server, its working well so far in development, though yet to be deployed. Its a pretty simple API, and it comes in two flavors, a flat cache, or a "POJO Cache" that uses insturmentation to keep State across servers. Basically, updates to fields are propgated across the network using JGroups. You may look at Oracle Coherence (formerly Tangosole Coherence). http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/coherence/coherencedatagrid/coherence_solutions.html I saw a demonstration of GridGain at our local JUG and I was very impressed. The documentation is very complete and it's very easy to get it going. I haven't started using it yet, so I can't quite say that it's working for us. http://www.gridgain.com/
