Tomcat doFilter() invoked with committed response tomcat servlets What version of Tomcat are you using? To me this sounds like a bug in Tomcat, I can't think of any reason why your doFilter method should be called with a response that's already been committed (if that filter is the only one in the chain, are you sure about this?). I have tried using Tomcat 6.16 and 6.18. This is definitely is the only filter in the chain. It seems that something is keeping a reference to the servlet outputStream. I wrapped the ServletOutputStream in my own OutputStream and then made sure the reference is destroyed. This fixed the issue so that I no longer see a committed response passed in. This is an odd side effect of holding a reference. But I don't think it qualifies as a Tomcat bug. More likely a bug in ImageIO.createImageOutputStream() that I suspect is holding the reference.
