Best GUI designer for eclipse? eclipse swing gui-designer 'Jigloo' is a very cool GUI designer. It is not free for commercial use however. It auto-generates code and allows for custom editing of the code it creates. http://www.cloudgarden.com/jigloo/ Another good GUI designer for Eclipse is Window Builder Pro. Like Jigloo, it's not free for commercial use. It allows you to design user interfaces for Swing, SWT and even the Google Web Toolkit (GWT). Visual Editor is a good choice. It generates very clean code, with no "layout" files beside of your sourcen using a simple but convenient pattern. It's very easy to patch the generated code and directly see the result. There are some stability problems (some times, the preview window does not refresh anymore...), but nothing that a "clean Project" can't fix... I use GWTDesigner http://www.instantiations.com/gwtdesigner/ which is not free but works well. Best of all, their customer support is top notch - very responsive. GWT Designer is very good and allows for rapid development of GWT websites. (http://www.instantiations.com/gwtdesigner/) well check out the eclipse distro easyeclipse at EasyEclipse. it has Visual editor project already added as a plugin, so no hassles of eclipse version compatibility.Plus the eclipse help section has a tutorial on VE. Look at my plugin for developing swing application. It is as easy as that of netbeans': http://code.google.com/p/visualswing4eclipse/ It's not free or open source. But you can give Intellij Idea's SWING GUI designer a try. visualswing4eclipse looks good but the eclipse update URL didn't work for me (I raised ticket 137) I was only able to install a previous version. Here's a url in case anyone wants it: http://visualswing4eclipse.googlecode.com/svn-history/r858/trunk/org.dyno.visual.swing.site/site.xml The plugin actually looks very good. Old question, but have you checked out JFormDesigner? Here is a quite good but old comparison http://wiki.computerwoche.de/doku.php/programmierung/gui-builder_fuer_eclipse Window Builder Pro is now free at Google Web Toolkit Window Builder Pro is a great GUI Designer for eclipse and is now offered for free by google.
