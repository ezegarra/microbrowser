<value columnNumber="1"> p I am calling a vendor's Java API, and on some servers it appears that the JVM goes into a low priority polling loop after logging into the API (CPU at 100% usage).  The same app on other servers does not exhibit this behavior. This happens on WebSphere and Tomcat.  The environment is tricky to set up so it is difficult to try to do something like profiling within Eclipse.    
 
 p Is there a way to profile (or some other method of inspecting) an existing Java app running in Tomcat to find out what methods are being executed while it's in this spinwait kind of state?  The app is only executing one method when it gets in this state (vendor's method). Vendor can't replicate the behavior (of course).    
 
 hr  
 
 p Update:      
 
 p Using JConsole I was able to determine who was running and what they were doing.  It took me a few hours to then figure out why it was doing it.  The problem ended up being that the vendor's API jar that was being used did not match exactly to the the database configuration that it was using.  It was defaulting to having tracing and performance monitoring enabled on the servers that had the slight mis-match in configuration.  I used a different jar and all is well.    
 
 p So thanks, Joshua, for your answer. JConsole was extremely easy to setup and use to monitor an existing application.     
 
 p @Cringe - I did some experimenting with some of the options you suggested.  I had some problems with getting JProfiler set up, it looks good (but pricey).

If just integration you are after, I will recommend Mule. I had very good experience with it and more important the architect is non invasive, so you could always migrate to a different ESB or other Buzz word complaint solution. 
One the the sweet spots of Mule is that it can be embedded within your application and your final artifact can be deployed on Webshpere, WLS, Glassfish etc... without even showing you embeded an ESB. Then this ESB can perform all the integration plumbing (managing connection types and protocols). Whereas some of the end points could be other integration solution you mentioned.

<value columnNumber="1"> p The core of J2EE is simply a bunch of interfaces that have implementations provided by a container.  Most applications do not use all of the J2EE specification.    
 
 p There are two main aspects of the J2EE that people think of when they discuss it: EJBs and Servlets.    
 
 p I have no experience whatsoever with EJBs.  I use the  a href="http://www.springframework.org/" rel="nofollow" Spring Framework /a  and as such it provides all of the "plumbing and boilerplate" code referenced as in Ben Collins' answer.  It provides all that we needed EJBs to do, and then some (transactions with database access is what we use its special features for, although we use its IOC container as well for the Servlet portion).    
 
 p Servlets, however, are fantastic.  They are a very good and proven technology.    
 
 p The core of a Servlet is a request and response cycle: a user requests something, and the server intercepts the request and provides a response based on it.  A chain of requests and responses can be kept track of by means of a Session for a single user.    
 
 p As for the high price of proprietary app servers, I have no idea why the price is so high, but Apache Tomcat is a very good Servlet container and is free.  We use Tomcat for testing and WebSphere for deployment (Websphere is provided by our client for the apps' use).  Unfortunately it's only Websphere 6 (update 11, as we found out to our dismay, which doesn't have the fix for update 13 which enables JSTL functions to operate properly when contained inside a JSP tag), so we're forced to use Java 1.4x, not Java 1.5+.    
 
 p There are also several frameworks (see the Spring framework referenced before for an example) that allow easy Servlet development.  If you're just using this for HTTP/HTML, there are a large number of frameworks to easily aid you in this development.

 p We are using IBM WebSphere Transformation Extender (which has lots of (other) problems, too) and the mapping tool of BizTalk is a joke in comparison to WTX.     
 
 p The graphical tool is not really usable for complex mappings (we have schemas with a few hundred fields in repeating groups) and if you do more than the usual "concat first name and last name to name" mappings, you will be tired of the graphical approach (for example the arguments of the functoids in the graphical mapper are not labeled and the order in which you connect fields to these arguments is important).     
 
 p The XSLT-Mapper was usable but not really convincing, and even the microsoft rep told us to use a tool like XMLSpy for XSLT and load the resulting XSL file into BizTalk.    
 
 p A third approach to mapping is to use C#-Code for the mapping, which was not acceptable for us as a general approach (we don't want to teach everyone C#).    
 
 p In addition to the mapping tool we did not like the deployment in BizTalk. In order to deploy your process, you need to make lots of settings in different tools and places. We had hoped to find a mechanism like a WAR file for Java Web Applications in BizTalk, so that you can give one archive for your whole process solution to your administrator and he can deploy it.

<value columnNumber="1"> p My own answer, after research.    
 
 p Part one: There seems to be no way to convince the application servers that I tested to put an error onto the wire past the "committed" phase.  The following Servlet code results in legal HTTP Chunked Transfer headers on the socket.  Interestingly, in the case of WebSphere an error message is appended to the end of the stream before the end mark.    
 
 pre  code public class Servlet extends HttpServlet { 
    public static final int ARRAY_SIZE = 65536; 
    private static final int SEND_COUNT = 100000; 
 
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, java.io.IOException { 
 
        String testData = "This is a fairly long piece of test text, running on and on and on, over and over."; 
 
        final ServletOutputStream outputStream = response.getOutputStream(); 
        for (int i = 0; i    SEND_COUNT; ++i) { 
            outputStream.println(testData); 
        } 
        throw new ServletException("Break it now"); 
    } 
} 
 /code   re  
 
 p Part two: Even if the application server was willing to either write bogus data to the wire or close the socket without a closing zero length chunk, common clients do not report an error.  IE7, FF3 and cURL do not report errors in chunk encoding.  This makes HTTP downloads inherently unreliable, and is contrary to the spirit if not the letter of the HTTP 1.1 RFC.

<value columnNumber="1"> p The single biggest reason for using interpreted languages for web development on the server side is ease of use. Web development tends to be very fast-paced and frequently updated. In such an environment, it's dramatically easier to use an interpreted language and scripts that can be updated without recompilation. Initial development pace is also much faster than what can be expected in writing in C. Similarly, it's generally easier to maintain scripts in high level languages than it is to maintain C++ or even Java code.    
 
 p That being said, many of the same benefits can be achieved using a templating system such as  a href="http://www.clearsilver.net/" rel="nofollow" Clearsilver /a  which is written in C and well known for being fast and light. Some large sites use C/C++ code for the most performance critical applications, like Yahoo  ;amp; Google groups. Java is also extremely common in "enterprise" web application software, which is why products like Tomcat and WebSphere exist, to provide a Java-friendly application server.    
 
 p The bottom line with writing server side (or any other) software is right tool for the job. You have to decide what your critical features are. If the most important thing is performance then C or C++ might be the right tool for the job. If the most important thing is speed of development, Python might be for you. If availability of frameworks and libraries for web projects is key, PHP might be the right choice.

There are a very large number of Java frameworks that support this like Tomcat, JBoss, WebSphere, WebLogic, JRun, Spring, etc.  In enterprise application circles Java is often the primary contender on the server side.    
 
 p The advantages which C/C++ bring to system programming and non-web applications are often lost in web serving situations.  The type of processing typically seen on a web server, even when it is CPU intensive (which is rare) rarely needs the type of low level tuning for which C is so well suited.  Because of this, large libraries and complex frameworks often bring the best advantage to the situation.  The cost of coding in C/C++ vs. Java, Ruby, PHP, etc. is seldom worth any potential performance trade off if there even is one (Java, for example, compares very favorably to C/C++ in web server applications.)    
 
 p Also, text processing is a major function of any web framework and this is an area where C is notoriously laborious in comparison with Perl, Python, Ruby, etc.

 p I would probably use Java Management Extensions (JMX). You could write a file-upload servlet that accepts an EAR and uses the deployment MBeans to deploy the EAR on the server. You would just POST the file over HTTP. This would avoid any WAS API dependencies on your dev/build machine and could be independent of any one project.   </value>

<value columnNumber="1"> p The thing with ATG is that it is both a framework and a solution.    
 
 p At the framework level, it is a Java based application platform for hosting web-based applications, as well as RMI accessible business components, with an ORM layer, a component container, an MVC framework, and a set of tag libraries for JSP.     
 
 p However, describing it thus is selling it short - even if you ignore the fact that they had most of this stuff before there was a J2EE spec.    
 
 p For starters, the ORM (Repositories) does more than just mapping to relational databases. It can handle LDAP, XML and file system data sources in a coherent and consistent manner.    
 
 p The component framework (The Nucleus) does far more than, say, the Spring bean container does - though I agree that properties files are less expressive than XML files    
 
 p The MVC framework (the basic Formhandler pattern) is more elegant, cleaner and easier to work with than most other web MVC frameworks I have seen, and the APIs are more consistent with the Servlet APIs    
 
 p The JSP tags for binding form elements on a page to values on business objects etc. are more elegent and cleaner than the form binding tags in any other framework I have seen. The mechanism of writing your own tag library equivalents (Droplets) is much more4 consistent with the Servlet API than standard J2EE tags.    
 
 p (While I am on the subject of consistency, I should mention that the APIs for writing the equivalent of filters (Pipeline Servlets) is a lot more consistent with the Servlet API than filters are).    
 
 p What's more, the framework at the basic level gives you an RMI container, distributed caching, distributed locking and distributed singletons, distributed events and messaging, a task scheduler, a rules engine and a mechanism for defining business workflows with custom actions and outcomes, a graphical editor for business workflows, support for versioned data, support for roles and rights, logging and auditing - all out of the box, and all using very coherent and consistent APIs    
 
 p Then at the solution level, you have the components and the APIs for dealing with user profiling, identity management and personalisation, content authoring and publishing, content search, product catalogs for tangible and intangible goods, product search and guided navigation, pricing, tax calculation, promotions, shopping carts, gift lists and wish lists, payment types, shipping methods, order tracking, customer relationship management etc.    
 
 p In addition, the extension points and integration points are usually very well designed and quite well documented. They support integration with pretty much anyone who is anyone in the e-commerce and publishing space for things like authoring and content management, identity management and security, product catalogs, search and guided navigation etc. Also, almost all areas of the framework are extensible and pluggable so you can write your own components to enhance or replace the ones out of the box.    
 
 p Together, this makes a very compelling platform.     
 
 p However, because of the way it was developed - possibly the very thing that makes it so consistent - means it is a very strange beast to most J2EE developers. ATG usually has its own way of doing pretty much everything that is now considered standard in J2EE. It used to have its own form of JSP called JHT^ML (I ahve heard that they invented it and donated the technology to Sun to become JSP), it has its own component container to host and manage the lifecycle of POJOS using dependency injection and reflection (sound familiar? they had it about a decade before Spring), it has its own APIs for developing tag libraries called Droplets, it has its own APIs for developing filters (Pipeline Servlets) and its own filter chain (the Pipeline), they have gone through two iterations of ORM - the first (Relational Views) only did ORM and used POJOs, reflection and bean mapping files (sounds familiar? they had this about a decade before Hibernate) and the second (Repositories) uses value dictionaries and gives a very consistent API for sourcing data from relational databases, LDAP, XML files and other sources. Moreover, ATG has (or rather, had) its own application server.    
 
 p Not to say that ATG is not J2EE compliant - it is. You can host WARs and EARs in an ATG server, and they just work.     
 
 p Over time, they seem to be moving away from the proprietary nature of things at the framework level while adding more and more value at the business solution level. They have moved away from JHTML and now use standard JSP - they have implemented all their custom tags as JSP tag libraries. They have moved away from their proprietary application server and now support deploying applications as EARs on Weblogic, WebSphere and JBoss.    
 
 p Likewise, I do not think they are averse to open source - they use quite a few open source frameworks internally - but they are certainly not open source. I doubt they will be - though I would like to see them open source some of their core framework components or migrate to more widely supported open source replacements - perhaps a Spring-based Nucleus?    
 
 p So, to answer your question, I do not think that there is an open source alternative to ATG. While you will find many open source alternatives to the framework bits - such as logging, ORM, bean container, tag libs, etc. you will be hard pressed to find a solution that can do so much so consistently.    
 
 p Of course, depending on what you want out of a free open source replacement for ATG, you could start with a JBoss based application that uses either EJB3 or Spring, and either EJB3 or Hibernate for your compoennt container and ORM. You can then add Drools for the rules and workflow engine, Spring MVC for the MVC and form binding tags, JSTL for other tags, Commons-DBCP for your datasources, Log4J for logging, Quartz for scheduling. You could look into integrating Apache Lucene with Hibernate for advanced searching.     
 
 p Acegi can provide security in Spring - but I do not know what open source frameworks can provide the full identity management/user profiling functionality that ATG provides.    
 
 p You can probably hand-roll the versioning support and a content authoring workflow on top of these technologies.    
 
 p There are a few open source 'shopping cart' applications out there - but I am not too familiar with how extensive they are.    
 
 p Perhaps the question is best asked "Which free and open source frameworks would you recommend for replacing which aspect of ATG". I have gone and created another question framed in this way.

 p I used WebLogic 8 about 3 years ago happy with WebLogic's ease of use and the licensing/cost model. We used it for two projects one was a web service and the other was a portal. We did not encounter any problems with WebLogic or WebLogic Portal in either of those projects.    
 
 p For the last two years I was working with WebSphere. Any time I negotiated with IBM it was always ended up costing twice as much as a WebLogic equivalent but corporate policy dictated WebSphere had to be used. I found the learning curve on WebSphere to be considerably steeper than WebLogic and our build/deploy/test life-cycle was so time consuming that we used Tomcat in the development environment. But the the biggest issue I had with WebSphere was when we encountered a bug that forced us to upgrade to the next patch release only to run into new problem parsing web.xml. It took a 48hr shift to work through all that.    
 
 p At the moment though I am using JBoss. About 3 months ago I was about to embark on my new project with Tomcat and Jetspeed 2, But I noticed that Jetspeed 2 seems a bit stagnant right now and JBoss Portal 2.7.0 was just released with JSR 286 ortlet 2.0 support.  I gave JBoss a spin and found it very easy to set-up and administer. The build/deploy/test cycle is very quick and I rarely have to restart the server unless I have changed a Spring XML file somewhere.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I have used WebLogic, WebSphere, JBoss, GlassFish, Resin, Jetty, Tomcat, and a few others over the last 10+ years.  So, if I were considering a new project, I would ask myself a few questions first.  One thing that I would not question anymore is that I would flat refuse to use JSPs unless I was tortured until I cried for my mommy.    
 
 p Do I have to be compatible/deploy to a specific product because of someone's mandate?  Is there no way to ignore them or convince them otherwise?  If so, there's your answer.    
 
 p Do I have to use EJBs?  Really?  Avoid them if at all possible--they are really only needed for very large, enterprise-class systems.  Remember that they are merely tools, and big ones at that (can anyone say "Golden Sledgehammer"?).  They are heavily overused, so really, really question whether you need them.  If you do need them, then that removes several of your options including my favorite, Jetty.    
 
 p Do you have to use any of the other major J2EE technologies like JMS, ESB, etc?  If so, and you really can't do without, then you are again constrained to a full-blown J2EE container.  Carefully think and investigate before you commit to BPM, for example, and avoid AquaLogic BPM at (almost) all costs--it is ugly in the extreme.    
 
 p If you really must use a full-blown J2EE container, consider open-source first because it is more robust, better supported, and more cost-effective.  They have larger customer bases and more open support interaction, so they tend to get better fixes faster.  However, Resin is immature and I would avoid it relative to GlassFish or JBoss--I found it problematic to deploy and support.  I would prefer JBoss because of its wider customer base, maturity, etc.  GlassFish is harder to incorporate into an automated build/deployment process, but it might be nicer for some of its specific features (if you need them).    
 
 p Do I have a special reason to need Apache?  Then lean towards Tomcat, perhaps plus something.    
 
 p Can I make do with just servlets?  Then I would use Jetty--it is the lightest, fastest, easiest, most flexible solution.  If I am leaning against being able to use Jetty, I would question all my assumptions of why.  YAGNI applies.    
 
 p Best is to use StringTemplate/WebStringTemplate on Jetty:  a clean, robust, fast, maintainable solution with no licensing fees, solid reputation and support, etc.  That is where I start nowadays.    
 
 p Most applications/systems choose lots of fancy J2EE features when all they really need is servlets and JDBC with some decent architecture/design.  Question why you think you need more.    
 
 p Of the full-blown containers, I would avoid WebLogic and WebSphere unless you are supporting a MAJOR public website (my current employer's website is deployed on WebLogic and it gets eleven+ million hits per month, others have been comparable).  WebLogic's real claim-to-fame is their relatively easy clustering, but avoid their proprietary vendor-lock-in features at (almost) all cost.  WebSphere is simply a nightmare that I would avoid literally at all cost--I refuse to do projects involving WebSphere after having done a couple in the past.  Neither product is worth the massive licensing fees, unless you truly have a special need that drives the use of a proprietary feature.  In a decade as a senior architect/engineer for lots of Fortune 500 companies, I have yet to see such a need.  On the other hand, I have seen LOTS of pain due to picking such proprietary products.    
 
 p Even for the really large, high traffic, public websites, the proprietary products are still questionable.  I would rather spend that multi-million dollars per year of licensing fees on some good hardware and some quality time from a handful of really good consultants to address a simple scalability solution.  The extra millions per year could then be used to produce something worthy of selling on that nice website...    
 
 p  em EDIT:  another piece to consider... /em     
 
 p I have recently encountered  a href="http://www.terracotta.org/" rel="nofollow" Terracotta /a .  I am rethinking everything, and looking to deploy it in a significant system soon.  In particular, Terracotta does clustering better than anything else, so I would NO LONGER recommend WebLogic for its clustering.

 p Here's how I think about it:    
 
 p SOA is about orienting your business functionality around services. That means thinking in terms of functionality black-boxes with (normally) well-defined interfaces. Often SOA also involves upfront work to make services available - this distinguishes it from more old-faishoned 'integration' - although there is a high degree of cross-over between the two.    
 
 p An ESB is simply an architectural layer that allows you to connect your services together. Often it adds connectivity, routing, protocol transformation etc. It's optional, but nevertheless a typical component of many SOA projects. It's a pattern, but many software vendors have ESB 'products' that can help to implement the pattern.    
 
 p These are admittedly vague answers, and some software/services vendors have more specific definitions (as well as a huge variety of technologies to implement them). You'll have to make your own mind up about those.

After setting up VMWare Server i created a new virtual machine and did all the software installations that i would need like WebSphere App Server, Oracle, WebSphere Commerce etc, after which i shutdown the VM, and copied over the virtual hard disk image to two different files, one as a clone VM and another as a backup.

 p An ESB is different things to different people, unfortunately.    
 
 p To me, an ESB is a any technology that you can insert into an SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture), allowing you to connect disparate systems together. It often performs the functions of protocol transformation, message modification, routing, logging, acting as a security gateway, and so on. For example, you might use an ESB to expose a service previously only available as a Web Service as a JMS-based service as well.    
 
 p In this respect, ESB implementations (or to be more precise, software sold to build ESBs with - such as that I consultant on) are often technologically similar to what used to be known as a messaging or queueing broker, although the purpose is somewhat different, because (as the acronyms imply) it's oriented around services rather than moving messages from one place to another. How important the distinction is technologically is a matter of opinion.

 p I would say that all web servers/servlet engines suffer from the same issues.  It's the applications that are deployed on them that represent the real security holes.  Cross-site scripting, SQL injection, lack of input validation, exposure of sensitive data due to poor layering and practices - these are all  em application /em  issues that will be problems regardless of which app server you choose.    
 
 p My personal opinion is that WebLogic is the best Java EE app server on the market.  I don't have first-hand experience with WebSphere, but people that I respect who have tell me that it's a horror show.  I've only used Tomcat for local development.  It's never failed me, but that's hardly production experience.  I have no idea how it scales.    
 
 p I'd think carefully about Spring's dm Server, based on Tomcat, Spring, and OSGi.  I have a feeling that it represents a future direction that all its competitors will be taking.

 p If that isn't an option, you might want to look at making one of your dependencies an EAR project utility JAR and configure MODULE classloading with a PARENT_LAST classloading policy on the WAR.

<value columnNumber="1"> p Vendors have been doing File transfer over a messaging system such as WebSphere MQ for over 12 years.  I have not used the IBM product.  Yet, I know until recently IBM resold Metastormâ€™s product (under the brand  a href="http://www.metastorm.com roducts M4Data.asp" rel="nofollow" PM4Data /a ) and only recently entered the market with a first generation product.    
 
 p Iâ€™ve seen  a href="http://www.metastorm.com roducts/metastorm_integration_manager.asp" rel="nofollow" Metastorm Integration Manager /a  handle files of terabyte sizes all of the time; breaking up the messages across WebSphere MQ and performing buffers acknowledgements so not to overflow message queues or having to do a lot of MQ Administration.    
 
 p Other worthwhile considerations of using messaging systems for file transfer vs. SFTP include:    
 
 ol  
 li  strong Pre-and Post-Data Movement Handling /strong  - As a network transport, SFTP moves data (as can file transfer products over WebSphere MQ).  To do pre- or post-movement processing, youâ€™d have to write your own monitoring, triggering, error handling, etc.  Mature vendors in the file transfer over messaging space provide infrastructure out-of-the-box for you.  Depending on your application, they can also help /li  
 li  strong Audit Trail /strong  - SFTP provides often provide system-level logging.  Often time, vendors providing file integration over MQ have greater audit capabilities, including the Pre- and Post-Data Movement Handling.  Some vendors also offer secure web-based systems to expose certain integrations to authorized users. /li  
 li  strong Exception Handling /strong  â€“ SFTP will give synchronous error messages from which you then code your error logic.  Vendors providing file integration over MQ often provide exception capabilities ranging from "hereâ€™s a message on queue signifying a problem happened... good luck" to built-in integration to Web-based consoles or even BPM system. /li  
 li  strong Treating File Transfer as a Service /strong  â€“ Often times, File Transfer is part of a larger business process.  Some vendors leverage this to chain file transfers and even have them collaborate with human-centric processes to provide end-to-end visibility around the context of a point-to-point file transfer.  Additionally, using messaging systems for file transfer helps move an organization to a more real-time, message-driven approach. /li

 p I decided to try out developing web-applications in Java, using IBM's WAS-CE platform. I've never worked with this platform before, nor any other platforms for running Java web applications (I've been using php for all my web projects).    
 
 p Now, I downloaded the community edition of WAS, and installed it on my laptop (Ubuntu 8.10, 64bit, java-6-sun-1.6.0.10). It worked like a charm. I proceeded to install WAS-CE on my development server (Ubuntu 8.10, 32bit, java-6-sun-1.6.0.07), and it seemed fine.    
 
 p However when I connect to the server (and it does bind to all ports I expect it to), when firefox requests a page (haven't tried other browser) the server returns a HTTP 400 - "bad request". If a connect manually to the server and give it a pure "GET /\n\n", it just closes the connection, while doing that works fine on my laptop.    
 
 p The only difference I can spot between the two installations is the older Java version (1.6.0.07 is the current one in the ubuntu repositories though), and the 32 bit processor. Is there such a great difference between those java versions that WebSphere would actually fail?

 blockquote  
   p A  strong  code ClassNotFoundException /code  /strong  is thrown when the reported class is not found by the ClassLoader. br /  
  This typically means that the class is missing from the  code CLASSPATH /code . br /  
  It could also mean that the class in question is trying to be loaded from another class which was loaded in a parent  code ClassLoader /code  and hence the class from the child  code ClassLoader /code  is not visible. br /  
  This is sometimes the case when working in more complex environments like an App Server (WebSphere is infamous for such  code ClassLoader /code  issues).    
   
   p People often tend to confuse  strong  code java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError /code  /strong  with  code java.lang.ClassNotFoundException /code . However there's an important distinction.     
   
   p For example an exception (an error really since  strong  code java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError /code  /strong  is a subclass of  strong  code java.lang.Error /code  /strong ) like    
 /blockquote

org/apache/activemq/ActiveMQConnectionFactory 
 /code   re  
 
 blockquote  
   p does not mean that the ActiveMQConnectionFactory class is not in the  code CLASSPATH /code .     
   
   p In fact, its quite the opposite.     
   
   p  strong It means that the class  code ActiveMQConnectionFactory /code  was found by the  code ClassLoader /code  however when trying to load the class, it ran into an error reading the class definition. /strong      
   
   p  strong This typically happens when the class in question has static blocks or members which use a Class that's not found by the  code ClassLoader /code . /strong      
   
   p So to find the culprit, view the source of the class in question ( code ActiveMQConnectionFactory /code  in this case) and  strong look for code using static blocks or static members /strong . br /  
  If you don't have access the the source, then simply decompile it using  strong  a href="http://www.kpdus.com/jad.html" rel="nofollow" JAD /a  /strong .

 blockquote  
   p Tip : To find out which jar a class belongs to, you can use the web site  strong  a href="http://www.jarfinder.com/" rel="nofollow" jarFinder /a  /strong .  This allows you to specify a class name using wildcards and it searches for the class in its database of jars. br /  
   a href="http://www.jarhoo.com/" rel="nofollow" jarhoo /a  allows you to do the same thing but its no longer free to use.    
   
   p If you would like to locate the which jar a class belongs to in a local path, you can use a utility like  strong  a href="http://www.inetfeedback.com/jarscan/" rel="nofollow" jarscan /a  /strong . You just specify the class you'd like to locate and the root directory path where you'd like it to start searching for the class in jars and zip files.

Especially nice is being able to change the log level on the fly (although you'll need either an admin screen or a background refresher to pick up the changes).

 pre  code 2195 (X'0893') 
MQRC_UNEXPECTED_ERROR 
Explanation: 
 
The call was rejected because an unexpected error occurred. 
Completion Code: 
 
MQCC_FAILED 
Programmer Response: 
 
Check the application's parameter list to ensure, for example, that the correct number of parameters was passed, and that data pointers and storage keys are valid. If the problem cannot be resolved, contact your system programmer. 
 
    * On z/OS, check whether any information has been displayed on the console. If this error occurs on an MQCONN or MQCONNX call, check that the subsystem named is an active MQ subsystem. In particular, check that it is not a DB2(TM) subsystem. If the problem cannot be resolved, rerun the application with a CSQSNAP DD card (if you have not already got a dump) and send the resulting dump to IBM. 
    * On OS/2 and i5/OS, consult the FFST record to obtain more detail about the problem. 
    * On HP OpenVMS, Compaq NonStop Kernel, and UNIX systems, consult the FDC file to obtain more detail about the problem.

 p The IBM WebSphere MQ sets the following JMSX* header properties:    
 
 p  strong JMSXUserId /strong  will be set by WMQ JMS when you send the message - it looks at 
the userid running the application and sets JMSXUserId accordingly.    
 
 p  strong JMSXAppId /strong  will also be set by WMQ JMS when you send the message - to 
something like " em WebSphere MQ Client for Java /em ". There is some debate over 
how to interpret the JMS Spec on this one - some JMS providers allow an 
application to set it, others don't. Currently, the WebSphere MQ 
implementation does not.    
 
 p  strong JMSXDeliveryCount /strong  will be set by WMQ JMS when the message is sent on to a 
receiving application - it tells that receiving application how many times 
WebSphere MQ has tried to deliver the message to that or other applications. 
Normally, messages should only be delivered once, but in the case of 
failures or explicit rollback of transactions etc., the delivery count may 
get higher, and applications or JMS providers can use that information to 
spot when things are going wrong and perhaps do something different like 
moving the message to a dead letter queue, or even discard the message, 
depending on the nature of the message, the application and the context.

 p An ESB is more of an architectural pattern or concept than a product - broadly, a service-based way of engineering loose coupling. Its definition is fought over and not exactly set in stone. In general, an ESB is set of unrelated (in a technical sense) services - they expose interfaces, and they consume them from other services. Generally there isn't a hub and spoke architecture involved, although there can be.    
 
 p IBM certainly markets both WebSphere Message Broker and WebSphere ESB as products that make it easy to build an ESB (along with the DataPower hardware appliance). They have different technological roots, but have some overlap in purpose. Also, that's not to say you can't build an ESB with lots of other things that aren't branded as an 'ESB product'.

<value columnNumber="1"> p As Rutesh and jmservera pointed out, the distinction is a fuzzy one.  Historically, they were different, but through the 90's these two previously distinct categories blended features and effectively merged.  At this point is is probably best to imagine that the "App Server" product category is a strict superset of the "web server" category.    
 
 p Some history.  In early days of the Mosaic browser and hyperlinked content, there evolved this thing called a "web server" that served web page content and images over HTTP. Most of the content was static, and the HTTP 1.0 protocol was just a way to ship files around.  Quickly the "web server" category evolved to include CGI capability - effectively launching a process on each web request to generate dynamic content.  HTTP also matured and the products became more sophisticated, with caching, security, and management features. As the technology matured, we got company-specific Java-based server-side technology from Kiva and NetDynamics, which eventually all merged into JSP.  Microsoft added ASP, I think in 1996, to Windows NT 4.0. The static web server had learned some new tricks, so that it was an effective "app server" for many scenarios.     
 
 p In a parallel category, the app server had evolved and existed for a long time. companies delivered products for Unix like Tuxedo, TopEnd, Encina that were philosophically derived from Mainframe application management and monitoring environments like IMS and CICS. Microsoft's offering was Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS), which later evolved into COM+. Most of these products specified "closed" product-specific communications protocols to interconnect "fat" clients to servers.  (For Encina, the comms protocol was DCE RPC; for MTS it was DCOM; etc.) In 1995/96, these traditional app server products began to embed basic HTTP communication capability, at first via gateways. And the lines began to blur.    
 
 p Web servers got more and more mature with respect to handling higher loads, more concurrency, and better features. App servers delivered more and more HTTP-based communication capability.      
 
 p At this point the line between "app server" and "web server" is a fuzzy one.   But people continue to use the terms differently, as a matter of emphasis. When someone says "web server" you often think HTTP-centric, web UI, oriented apps. When someone says "App server" you may think "heavier loads, enterprise features, transactions and queuing, multi-channel communication (HTTP + more).  But often it is the same product that serves both sets of workload requirements.

 li WebSphere, IBM's "app server" has its own bundled web server. /li  
 li WebLogic, another traditional app server, likewise. /li

 p  strong 30 April Update (2) /strong     
 
 p So it seems that this CPU activity is some kind of housekeeping activity for the web-container or maybe something within Apache Axis. I've now observed this happening on a few different web-applications on a few different servers. Applications with no web component don't suffer the same additional CPU overhead.    
 
 p I'd imagine if it is housekeeping work, that "tuning" it somehow could be counter productive - by that, I mean that making the App Server idle better would probably negatively affect the amount of "real" work it can do.

I recommend asking someone who works in the mainframe department to spend a day or two teaching you the basics. IBM training may be helpful as well but I donâ€™t have any experience with it so canâ€™t guarantee it will. Iâ€™ve put my story about learning how to use the mainframe below for some context. It was decided that all the interns were going to learn how to use the mainframe as a summer project that would take 20% of there time. It was a complete disaster since all the interns accept me were working in non mainframe areas and had no one they could yell over the cube wall to for help. The ISPF and JCL environment was to alien for them to get proficient with quickly. The only success they had was basic programming under USS since itâ€™s basically UNIX and college familiarized them with this. I had better luck for two reasons. One I worked in a group of about 20 mainframe programmers so was able to have someone sit down with me on a regular basis to help me figure out JCL, submitting jobs, etc. Second I used  a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/awdtools/rdz/" rel="nofollow" Rational Developer for System z /a  when it was named WebSphere Developer for System z. This gave me a mostly usable GUI that let me perform most tasks such as submitting jobs, editing datasets, allocating datasets, debugging programs, etc. Although it wasnâ€™t polished it was usable enough and meant I didnâ€™t have to learn ISPF. The fact that I had an Eclipsed based IDE to do basic mainframe tasks decreased the learning curve significantly and meant I only had to learn new technologies such as JCL not an entirely new environment. As a further note I now use ISPF since the software needed to allow Rational to run on the mainframe wasnâ€™t installed on one of the production systems I used so ISPF was the only choice. I now find that ISPF is faster then Rational Developer and Iâ€™m more efficient with it. This is only because I was able to learn the underlying technology such as JCL with Rational and the ISPF interface at a later date. If I had to learn both at once it would have been much harder and required more one on one instruction.

<value columnNumber="1"> p One of the projects I was in charge of as a JSP/Struts developer at my last employer was a themes tag library (present on every WebSphere server as a shared library) that let any Java web dev in the company pull in any of the standard themes like intranet, public, etc. with minimal effort. The themes included header, footer, navigation, and links to css  ;amp; javascript, etc. They could even customize things a bit when we gave them the option, like choosing a selected tab.    
 
 p This setup was ideal because we could make centralized change to any standard UI elements and they were automatically pulled in by all sites using themes without any effort by the site developer.    
 
 p With the new job I started in December, I've switched to using ASP.NET. I'd like to propose something similar in spirit to the themes app here, since we're running a bunch of different sites that should have a unified look and feel.    
 
 p What's the best way to accomplish this? I'd rather not have to recompile anything to update the theme to make this work.    
 
 h1 Edit: /h1  
 
 p Although I was hoping for a better answer, the .NET gods apparently don't approve of what I was trying to accomplish. Here are the three options that were found:    
 
 ol  
 li  p  strong Compile a Master Page into a DLL and put it into the GAC: /strong  
This works in simple cases, but as a hack it's too brittle. I couldn't get it to work correctly with our site.    /li  
 li  p  strong Create a virtual directory to the Master Page in each web app: /strong  This actually does work, although it doesn't make for a very comfortable development environment. However, one of the things we are trying to move away from is having to create virtual directories inside each web application. No dice.    /li  
 li  p  strong Create a bunch of custom controls, compile them into a DLL, and put it into the GAC: /strong  This is the answer I selected. It's the least centralized option and requires more work for the developer of each site, but it seems to be the only Microsoft-blessed way.    /li  
 /ol  
 
 p In conclusion, I'm pretty frustrated with .NET over this. In the grand scheme of things Master pages are just code, and I don't see any reason why they couldn't be easily centralized for use in multiple web applications. This seems to be a major loss compared to JSP/Java.

 p JBoss uses Tomcat as their web front end, of course, so it's not either/or.    
 
 p I've seen people add OpenEJB and ActiveMQ to Tomcat and get all the features of a Java EE app server.  The line is rather blurred.    
 
 p Spring DM server is built on Tomcat.  It'll be interesting to see whether it can start taking mind and market share away from the Java EE app server folks.    
 
 p I love Spring - it's my preferred framework - but I can tell you that it comforts some folks to know that Java EE is a standard that's implemented by multiple app server vendors.  If you don't use vendor-specific extensions, in theory your code can be moved from WebSphere to WebLogic to JBoss without changes.  Some large IT shops like that.  They shy away from Spring because it's not a standard.  It's the brainchild of Rod Johnson and his team.  If you decide you don't like their stuff you have nowhere else to go.

Exactly how you create the  code QueueConnectionFactory /code  will be vendor specific (JMS is basically a driver spec for message queues just as JDBC is for databases) but on IBM MQ it something like this:    
 
 pre  code MQQueueConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new MQQueueConnectionFactory();

 p The best way to access a remote queue, or any queue for that matter, is to add a  code Queue /code  instance to the JNDI registry.  For remote queues this is achieved using MBeans that add the  code Queue /code  instance when the server starts.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I have no benchmarks to substantiate the following, this is just "we all know that" conventional wisdom. As with all performance discussions Your Milage Will Vary, if this is absolutely critical to your application then you need to perform your own benchmarks.    
 
 p I believe that there is no signifincant performance overhead from using an XA-capable connection pool for non-XA work - WebSphere is careful to use 1PC transactions when only a single resource is used in a transaction. The primary overhead of XA is the extra Prepare/Commit/Forget set of XA messages, these will not occur in a simple 1PC case.    
 
 p So the primary danger is of inadvertantly initiating a 2PC transaction. This can happen if you do several pieces of work supposedly against the same resoruce but with (for example) different isolation levels. You obtain a connection from the pool and do some work, that connection is now associated with your transaction until COMMIT. You "close" the connection, notionally returing it to the pool, but in fact WebSphere's pooling keeps the connection for your transaction. You ask for the connection again to do some more work, provided that you are asking for exactly the same connection you will be given the same connection again and so work continues in a single transaction - we have only 1PC, no overhead.     
 
 p I would take the approach of initially haveing a single, XA-capable pool, but have two separate resoruce references, one for 2PC work, one for 1PC work. Have both references point to the same connection pool. Your code now is isolated from any need to have separate connection pools, it's just a matter of rebinding the resource-ref if you ever do need to make the change.

If your App Server does not have that capability, then crafting some shell scripts to give something like that function should be doable.    
 
 p This works quite nicely assuming:    
 
 p a). Requests from users are sprayed around the a larger set of JVMs.  
b). That all requests are stateless or there is some state replication capability. Replication is a capability of WebSphere and WebLogic, I'd guess that other app servers have the capability too.    
 
 p In such environments there's no need to "slowly" move people to other servers. We just need to know that we can safely stop any one serve/JVM and that these sessions will pick up on another instance.

 li JDBC /li  
 li JNDI for pooling database connections (optional but recommended) /li  
 li Basic authentication for security /li  
 /ol  
 
 p You can accomplish a great deal knowing just those.  If you want to minimize the learning curve, I'd recommend starting with those and staying away from EJBs, JMS, Struts, JSF, etc.    
 
 p Another benefit is that this subset of features is common to both servlet/JSP engines, like Tomcat, Jetty, Resin, etc. and full-blown Java EE app servers like WebLogic, JBOSS, WebSphere, etc.  An app that runs on one should be portable to any of the others, as long as you stay away from app engine-specific extensions.    
 
 p You should realize that there's a trade-off here.  You'll have to develop pieces that might be easier if you leverage the app server more.  But hopefully you'll start with some simpler problems and work your way up once you're comfortable with the basics.

 p I was tasked with writing a JSR168 compliant portlet to search a database. When you open the portlet, you're given 6 search boxes for different criteria to search several thousand records. Once you press search, it brings up another page (it keeps the first page and uses  code   jsp: include  /code  for the second page so users can see/change their search terms) with the search results. From the search results page, the user can click on one of the results (which redirects to a new page) and get more detailed information about it.    
 
 p All of that works. The problem is when the user wants to search again.     
 
 p When I developed this, I used LifeRay installed on my local machine. Everything works perfectly in IE, Firefox, and Chrome. However, when I deploy it to our development portal (IBM WebSphere), it doesn't quite work in IE. In Firefox/Chrome, when a user is on the detailed information page, they can hit back on their browser and it loads a cached version of the search results. Perfect, because this content rarely changes.    
 
 p However, in IE, when they click the back button on the detailed view, we get a "Webpage has expired message". I've tried every caching setting in the portal settings for the portlet as well as the page, but haven't had any luck.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I'll suggest a pattern that might work. But first ... I'd like to suggest that perhaps the requirement may be benefit from a little interpretation. What's actually going on that needs a 5 second timeout, and needs to be very sure (abort transaction sure) that that work didn't happen if the timeout is reached? And in which case how upset would the user be if his browser crashed or a network glitch happened before they saw the result - because in that case we can't know from the client end what happened, and the client is under the conditions of the questions (and almost inevitably) not participating in the transaction.    
 
 p So a different model of interaction might be simpler to implement and give quite good reliability. I'll describe that model and then explain how you can refine it to give the 5 second timeout too if you do need it.    
 
 p My suggested model of interaction is the "place-order, check-for-fills-later" model. This is what is ofetn used for an online trading system. The client sends a request, the system stashes the request away safely somewhere and immediately responds to the client. No timeout needed the stashing away is very quick. Then in an a worker thread (use an MDB in JEE land, or WebSphere's asynch beans) the real work can be done.    
 
 p The client later can ask "that order number 73, how's it going?" or "please cancel order 73". Using Ajax or callback techniques we can give a very nice UI over that model.    
 
 p Note that the implementation of client saying "cancel" and the system going "finished that one" needs to be mediated by suitable locking, usually by some database.    
 
 p Using optimistic locking, a SQL statment meaning something like    
 
 pre  code Update order 73 to cancelled WHERE its state is working 
if the number of rows updated == 0 then "TOO LATE we already filled it" 
 /code   re  
 
 p Hence the filler can, in its primary transaction, attend to update to "FILLED" and abort the transaction if the record has been cancelled.    
 
 p We have meadiated between two asychronous "threads".    
 
 p For many system this is enough.     
 
 p Bear in mind:    
 
 ul  
 li if your worker is taking a long time, it may be very bad for overall throuput to cancel it at the end of the work, will the user jusy submit the request again. /li  
 li While the work is down in the depths of JDBC you probably cannot interrupt it, so "runaway" queries will not be stopped by anything we've discussed here. /li  
 /ul  
 
 p If you do need the 5 second timeout, all you do is exactly the above except the the service is coded to do the cancel check after sleeping, rather than immediately returning to the client and doing the check in a later, separate request. So the client code lookes like:    
 
 pre  code Begin tran 
     stash request 
Commit 
 
// now the worker may get round to starting the work sometime 
 
Sleep 5 seconds 
 
Begin Tran 
     attempt to cancel! 
     // that will fail if the work is completed 
     // the WHERE will not find the record in the right state 
if update worked COMMIT 
     // now worker cannot complete 
else ABORT 
 
// by here the work is either complete or cancelled 
// even if worker is still running it cannot complete 
 
return state of record

 p The answer to your question depends on what you're expecting WebSphere ESB (WESB) to do for you. If you're simply trying to connect a Web Service consumer to a Web Service provider, you don't need need WESB to do that. However, typically folks want to use WESB because they either want to put some logic between the two (maybe transforming from one Web Service interface to another, for example), or because they might want to later. In either case, you'll need to create a mediation module to do that - there is no bus per se that you just connect services to.    
 
 p In practice, you will need WebSphere Integration Developer (WID) to do that - it would be a lot of work to create the mediations manually, it's not documented, and it's not supported by IBM either. Your local IBM client team should be able to advise you, but these products are typically purchased together.

<value columnNumber="1"> p Several reasons, most of which may or may not apply to a particular need.    
 
 p 1)  Support.  Many enterprises like to have a support contract with the vendor who developed the server.  With an open source solution you are pretty much "on your own."    
 
 p 2)  Full J2EE / EJB support.  While I don't find this particularly useful myself, these features are widely used by commercial applications.  If you need them, there's really no alternative.  If you don't need them, they're a waste.    
 
 p 3)  Good administration consoles.  Tomcat has an admin console that will allow you to add and remove applications.  As far as I am aware, that's about as far as it goes.  WebSphere has that (though not very streamlined), but you can also alter connection pool sizes, data sources, thread pool sizes, change the logging configuration (very high granularity), and activate memory and JVM profiling.  Mostly without restarting the App Server.  Supposedly, clustering is relatively easy to set up as well.  The ability to install a .EAR file is notably missing from tomcat as well, and if you have multiple inter-related applications to install, it becomes a real pain to manage them all.    
 
 p You can do (at least) most of (3) in tomcat as well, but not through the admin GUI.  Some people like to have a nice GUI.

 p SOAP is basically based on (per HTTP definition) non-cacheable POST requests, and REST uses GET - which is easy to cache.    
 
 p You would have to inspect the SOAP (POST) request before it goes to the actual Webservice - i.e. using a proxy. "Standard" proxies are usually unaware of SOAP syntax.

 p If you wanted to use Hibernate's transaction manager instead, just replace the transactionImpl bean's class to the hibernate one in your original question.    
 
 p As for which manager is better, I honestly can't think of any significant reasons to choose one over the other.  The only thing I can think of is it may come into play if you have clustered application servers that share the load, rather than simply being a failover.  Maybe transactions can be shared across them?  I don't know.  If someone can think of something else, feel free to correct me.    
 
 p  strong EDIT: /strong  It looks like WebSphereTransactionManagerFactoryBean (what I used above) doesn't need to be used for WebSphere 6.0 and up, and according to the  a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/api/org/springframework/transaction/jta/WebSphereTransactionManagerFactoryBean.html" rel="nofollow" WebSphere Transaction Manager Spring Docs /a  you should use  a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/api/org/springframework/transaction/jta/WebSphereUowTransactionManager.html" rel="nofollow" WebSphereUowTransactionManager /a  as a direct replacement for JTA.  So instead of the Hibernate transaction manager in your original example, just use the WebSphereUowTransactionManager class.  Spring grabs the transaction manager off of the application server's JNDI tree, so you might have to set some property to specify the JNDI name.    
 
 p From what I can tell, the WebSphere transaction manager gives you the ability to, among other things, do transaction suspension.  Personally I would go with the app server's transaction manager, regardless of whether it was WebSphere or Weblogic or Glassfish or whatever.

Tomcat already does that for you, instead, define a data source in Tomcat, and have your ORM framework use it (when you define your Tomcat data source, you can specify the pool configurations there).    
 
 p If you could post some code snippets, specifically, the relevant Spring context configurations, I can help provide you with how you'd do this.

 p What's wrong with the DB solution? It's clear that locking is going to be needed, so why not leave to the DB. My guess is that if you really need true incremental values, no values missed etc. then transactional relationships with other database values will be important, so use the DB.    
 
 p If you can relax the need for absolute sequenetial values (ie. allow gaps) then you can parcel out sets of numbers and thereby greatly reduce contention. If you truly need sequential values, no gaps, then you are buying into the need for some degree of locking between the instances - you can't allow a second "thread" to get a new sequence number until you "commit" the use of the current one. If you can afford to lose the odd sequence number then you do much better. Or if you can independent numbering schemes between instances you are in a much better positions.  For example name you servers a, b, c ... have ids a001, a002, b001, c001, c002 etc.

 p You may want to consider HTTP because of its ease of use and simplicity which ultimately reduces development time. If you are doing something that might be directly consumed by a browser (through an AJAX call) then you should use HTTP. For a browser to directly consume TCP connections without HTTP you would have to use Flash or Silverlight and this normally happens for rich content such as video and/or audio.

 /ul  
 
 p Other than that, my only advice is that you stick to good OO design practices. For instance, use a DAO to write to your database, this way, if you find that Berkeley DB isn't quite for you, you can switch to a relational database system with relative ease. It also makes it easy for you to move on to some database partitioning solutions (e.g.,  a href="https://www.hibernate.org/414.html" rel="nofollow" Hibernate Shards /a ) if you decide you need it.

 p Workflow tools with a graphical interface tend to be slow to program and do a poor job of managing complexity - typically much poorer than a programming language.  This issue also applies to ETL tools and transactional integration tools such as BizTalk or WebSphere Integrator.  Practically, this means that implementing complex business logic in a workflow tool tends to be quite long winded and often difficult to test.    
 
 p K2 is probably as good as any workflow tool and is based on Sharepoint, so it will play nicely with software written on a Microsoft stack.  It  em may /em  give you a productivity win over raw MS workflow foundation, but I doubt it will be a silver bullet.

Perhaps my current employer negotiated a bad agreement, but we have to purchase WebSphere licenses in blocks of $4M at a time, with attendant RSA licenses and other nonsense.    
 
 p WebLogic (and JBOSS) use a separate domain for each deployed app.  Changing configuration for one app doesn't affect all the others.    
 
 p My current employer's installation of WebSphere comes with a deployment queue that causes deployments to back up during the day like airplanes waiting to take off at Kennedy Airport.  This gives that single threaded configuration time to sort itself out.  No such issue with JBOSS or WebLogic.    
 
 p WebSphere has traditionally lagged behind its competition in supported JVMs.  That might not be the case now, since most Java EE apps run on JVM 5 at a minimum.    
 
 p I'd rather use JMS than MQ Series.    
 
 p Is it any wonder that my current employer is getting off WebSphere and onto JBOSS as quickly as they can?    
 
 p WebLogic is a solid product that was the industry standard for a long time.  I think BEA has lost a lot of their talent over the years, and the purchase by Oracle has left them in limbo for the last two years (stuck on version 10.1).  But it's far better than WebSphere will ever be.      
 
 p My recommendation would be to use anything other than WebSphere.  You'd be better off to learn Spring and use Tomcat.

 li App Server. You see Tomcat as heavy in terms of runtime footprint, or amount of learning or ...? I would tend to chose something that has well established integration with an IDE. So Eclipse + Tomcat or Apache Geronimo, perhaps in it's  a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/community/" rel="nofollow" WebSphere Community Edition /a  guise would do the job. From what I've seen these are sufficient for what you want, and the learning curves are really pretty manageable. /li  
 li Yes JSPs. You may yet find that your presentation needs become a tad more complex. The extra effort of going to JSF might yet pay off - nice widgets such as Date pickers.  /li  
 li In your processing you will have a servlet (or an action class if you're using JSF) that class can have a member variable of type Engine initialised on startup and then used for every request. The thing to bear in mind is that many users will hit that servlet, and hence that engine at the same time. Is your Engine safe to be used from more than one thread at the same time?  /li  
 /ol  
 
 p To expand in this point. When implementing JSPs, there are two models refered to as (with some inventiveness) as Model 1 and Model 2. See  a href="http://www.javafaq.nu/java-article447.htl" rel="nofollow" this explanation /a .     
 
 p In the case of model 1 you tend to put code directly into the JSP, it's acting in a controller role. Persoanlly, even when dealing with small, quickly developed apps, I do not so this. I always use Model 2. However if you choose you can just put some Java into your JSP.    
 
 pre  code   %  MyWorker theWorker = MyWorkerFactory.getWorker(); 
    // theWorker.work(); 
%  
 /code   re  
 
 p I woudl favour having a factory like this so that you can control the creation of the worker.  The factory would have something like (to give a really simple example)    
 
 pre  code private static MyWorker s_worker = new MyWorker(); 
public static synchronized getWorker() { 
       return s_worker; 
} 
 /code   re  
 
 p Alternatively you could create the worker when that method is first called.     
 
 p In the case of model 2 you naturally have a servlet into which you are going to put some code, so you can just have    
 
 pre  code private MyWorker m_worker = MyWorkerFactory.getWorker(); 
 /code   re  
 
 p This will be initialised when the servlet is loaded. No need to worry about setting it to load on startup, you just know that it will be initialsed before the first request is run. 
Better still, use the init() method of the servlet. This is guranteed to be called before any requests are processed and is the servlet API architected place for such work.     
 
 pre  code public class EngineServlet extends HttpServlet { 
 
private Engine engine; 
 
// init is the "official" place for initialisation

 p In JEE the MVC  em model /em  can be thought of as a "domain model", ie the Java objects representing the entities that are important to your application.  For instance a shopping application would have domain objects representing items for purchase, shopping carts, credit cards, mailing addresses, accounts, reviews, and so forth.  Often these domain objects come from persistent storage such as a relational database.      
 
 p JEE's Java Persistence API is designed to handle the mapping between the Java domain model objects and the relational database tables used to make the objects persistence.   a href="https://www.hibernate.org/397.html" rel="nofollow" Hibernate /a  is one implementation of a JPA "object-relational mapper" (ORM).      
 
 p Java EE is much more than that.  To take just one example, it defines an ultra-reliable messaging service (Java Message Service) that back end application components use to communicate with each other.    
 
 p As you explore Java EE, do give some thought to simpler and more productive alternatives like Ruby-on-Rails, LAMP stacks, Microsoft's .NET platform, and "light-weight" Java approaches like Spring/Hibernate.  Richard Monson-Haefel, who wrote O'Reilly's very successful "Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0" (the fifth edition) and "Java Message Service", even goes so far as to  a href="http:/ odcast.burtongroup.com/ip/files/bgip%5Fjee5%5Fthe%5Fbeginning%5Fof%5Fthe%5Fend.mp3" rel="nofollow" claim /a  that Java EE is "intimidating" to developers and will be eclipsed by these other approaches.

 p In WebSphere (for a few versions anyway) there is the concept of a startup bean.  Rather than trying to explain it in detail as it was a couple of years ago that I did this you can have a look at this link  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.express.doc/info/exp/asyncbns/tasks/tasb%5Fconfstb.html" rel="nofollow" http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/inforcenter... /a     
 
 p This essentially allows you to create an EJB bean which implements two methods:    
 
 pre  code public boolean start() { 
    return new Delegate().start(); 
} 
 
public void stop() { 
    new Delegate().stop(); 
} 
 /code   re  
 
 p If you return true from the start method it returns a successful start, otherwise returning false stops the application starting so in the console the application will indicate that it failed to start.  We implemented a Delegate to do the work so we could wire it up to either the startup bean or a ServletContextListener if the container didn't implement startup beans.    
 
 p The only additional thing with startup beans is that in WebSphere you need to enable the Startup beans service in the Administrative Console or else they won't run and your app won't do any initialisation but will still show as started when you try and start it up.  There is information on how to do that from the above page.    
 
 p I am also sure there is more detailed information in an IBM Redbook about this but at the moment I can't seem to locate it.

Your situation is more complex. There needs to be a Transaction Manager, which looks after all the details managing distributed transactions across the databases. So you need an implementation offering the JTA apis.    
 
 p Although you could, in principle develop this your self, it's a very speciliased piece of work so practically you need to use an existing implementation. This is one of the things you get when you use a JEE application server.

 p Which ever one you pick, make sure you use their JDBC connection pools for your JDBC connections (very easy to do)  and I would suggest using simple Session Bean (in EJB 3 this is also really easy) to demark your transactions.      
 
 p Overall, you'll need to write about 4 new lines of code (or annotations). over what you have now and "bingo!" you're doing 2PC transactions. There is a bit of a learning curve in getting the App Servers up and learning how to use the facilities but if you need Java distributed transactions you need infrastructure services and prgramming framework so some level of learning is inevitable.

<value columnNumber="1"> p The way that I have dealt with this is to use property values on the JVM's but then reference them to a WebSphere variable that is defined at the cluser or cell level.  For example, say you want a value called value1 set in param1 in your spring configuration you would do the following:    
 
 pre  code   bean id="propertyConfigurer" class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer"   
 /code   re  
 
 p And then something like as follows do reference the variable:    
 
 pre  code   bean id="id" class="com.blah.class"  
          property name="value1" value="${param1}"   
  /bean  
 /code   re  
 
 p Then within your tests you can setup your tests as follows:    
 
 pre  code /** 
     * @see org.springframework.test.AbstractSingleSpringContextTests#prepareApplicationContext(org.springframework.context.support.GenericApplicationContext) 
     */ 
    @Override 
    protected void prepareApplicationContext(GenericApplicationContext context) { 
    	System.setProperty("param1", "myvalue"); 
        } 
 /code   re  
 
 p Then from within the websphere configuration, if you create a JVM variable and link it to the WebSphere variable you only need to change the WebSphere variable and it will automatically update all the JVM variables on each machine.    
 
 p To do this, create a JVM variable called:    
 
 p param1    
 
 p with a value of ${webspherevar.param1}    
 
 p And then create a WebSphere variable called:    
 
 p webspherevar.param1    
 
 p That contains whatever the value you need to put in it.  This allows you to then not have to ship around the values for each environment and they can be instead loaded into the environment and just used.    
 
 p I hope this helps.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I have two separate installs of WebSphere.  (Actually one is WebSphere Application Server V6.1 with EJB 3.0 and Web Services feature packs, and the other server is WebSphere ESB Server V6.2).  However, I know that ESB is really built on top of WAS, so it has all the configuration settings that a regualr WAS server has.    
 
 p In my ESB server, I am trying to expose a service written as EJB 3.0 that will be deployed to the WAS 6.1 server.  My question is not how to get EJB 2.1 calls to call into an EJB 3.0. We've done that already.  My question is how to call across physical VM's.  The WebSphere Application Server is running in its own cell/node/server from the ESB Server.  From what I've read in IBM documentation, it is possible to set up a namespace binding on WAS to point to a remote EJB on another WAS instance.  Thus you could use JNDI to lookup a bean on one WAS instance that really resides in another WAS instance.  The beauty of this method is the location of the EJB you want is abstracted to the container level, and you don't have to drag around properties files of the IP addresses and ports that you need to access the bean should it change servers, etc.  You just make a standard JNDI lookup to a remote EJB and you get it.    
 
 p Sounds like it can be done.  (See the following links:  
 a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.express.doc/info/exp/ae/tnam_view_bindings.html" rel="nofollow" http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.express.doc/info/exp/ae/tnam_view_bindings.html /a )  Especially follow the links on EJB and Indirect namespace bindings.    
 
 p But I've been hitting my head against this for a while.  It makes sense.  It looks like it can be done.  And the Indirect namespace binding looks the most promising.  But I can't get it to work quite right.  My ESB server keeps complaining about not finding comp/env/ejb in the context in which I am asking for it.  Very puzzled by this one.    
 
 p Just wondering if anybody has done this kind of thing before.  Can you give me a concrete example of how you set this up in WAS to do so?  Any help is appreciated

<value columnNumber="1"> p Unless you have other offers, I would say to absolutely take it.  ColdFusion is a programming language, so you will be getting real-world programming experience to put on a resume some day.  Plus ColdFusion experience will train you in web development, and it will teach you the same principles that are used in .net, J2EE, and especially PHP development.    
 
 p Having full-time working experience on your resume helps a lot when you graduate, to give you an edge over other students who may not have working experience.  Plus, you'll have other languages (Java? C++? C#?) that you are using in your college courses, so it's not like ColdFusion will be the only language you're capable of using.    
 
 p In my own experience, I had a summer internship in an IT department where I learned a lot of Access and SQL stuff, which happened to land me a co-op job the next summer as a software tester at a cell-phone company which happened to want someone cheap to build an Access database for them.  The next summer, with two full-time internships under my belt, I had an edge over other students in applying for another co-op position at IBM, where I was a WebSphere tester.  Even as a tester at IBM, I got the chance to write Java code (to test WebSphere you have to write WebSphere apps).  So by the time I graduated, I had a full year's worth of experience, which stands out for someone hiring an entry-level employee.  In fact, my manager at my first job after college specifically told me (after hiring me) that one of the main factors in her hiring decision was that I had experience at a 40-hour-a-week work for a similarly-run corporation.    
 
 p Now, of my three internships, only one touched on any actual programming, yet it helped me greatly to get where I am today as a programmer.  So I'd say an internship where you are actually doing programming, even in ColdFusion, is a great idea for your future.

 p First node need to do servlets and JSPs. JEE servers do that, JBoss does JEE, so that's reasonable use of JBoss. You could use other JEE servers, but the little you've said gives no reason to avoid JBoss. So that's one copy.    
 
 p Second node, WebServices and some Business logic and some DB access. Again JEE does that sort of stuff. There are alternatives, but if you already know JBoss, then why not? If you are using JBoss in node 1 I wouldn't choose a different JEE server in node 2. [I don't have experience for using non-JEE solutions in this layer - no doubt Spring afficionados could comment.] So if using JEE here, then JBoss, another instance.    
 
 p That leads to the question why are separating the nodes? One reason might be to allow you to scale the Presentation and Business tiers separately. Hence in the longer run you might have more than just two JBoss instances.     
 
 p Strong advice: design from day on on the assumption that you might want to scale in that way. All too easy (for example) to create huge Http Sessions that don't work well in clusters.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I believe this answer comes late in the day, but it is put down to help others understand how WTP support for WebSphere works in Eclipse.    
 
 p WTP support for the newer versions of the WebSphere Application Server come only with commercial IDEs - Rational Application Developer, for example. MyEclipse is another IDE that comes with support for WAS 7; one would need the Blue Edition to work against a v7.0 WAS instance.    
 
 p The philosophy is that if the vanilla Eclipse WTP project has to support an application server, then the application server vendor must either provide the adapter or some means to perform the integration. For obvious reasons, this is absent for WAS 6.1 and 7.0, but available for 6.0.    
 
 p This was the case, but IBM has since release WebSphere Application Server tools edition and has donated a server adapter to the Eclipse market place.  This will cover WAS 7, 8 and 8.5 alpha.

<value columnNumber="1"> p Short answer: yes. JDE can communicate with a bunch of external objects/services/adapters.    
 
 p Long answer: your options depend on what version of JDE your customer is using and what are the requirements for said communication.    
 
 p Since you're mentioning that they want to call an API, I'm assuming they have a pretty recent version (say, OneWorld/EnterpriseOne product, version XE or newer) and that they need "online interface" (I mean, they will call the API from JDE and wait for it to finish processing and return something, before their JDE program continues) instead of "batch processing".    
 
 p Your best option, I think, would be COM. JDE is compliant with COM. Your customer will have to know his way around JDE Interoperability, specially calling an external API using COM and GenCOM (that's how the API would be kind of packaged for JDE's usage).    
 
 p Can it connect to Java? Yes. Kind of the same way it does with COM, you have to package/encapsulate the code to be consumed.    
 
 p Can it use XML? Yes.    
 
 p What about Adapters? Yes. MQ WebSphere, MSMQ.    
 
 p Webservices? Maybe. It depends on what version of JDE is used. Recent versions do Webservices pretty well. You can provide a business function from JDE to be consumed by others and you can also consume services from others, so if your API can be used in a web service, JDE could consume it (again, depending on the version they have).    
 
 p For webservices, you can use wSG (Web Services Gateway), Business Services Server and JMQ Queue/Topic for J2EE Connectivity.    
 
 p Other methods available are more suitable for batch processing: EDI, OSA, z tables, table conversions.    
 
 p Oracle has pretty good guides on JDE Tools (you have to search for EnterpriseOne Tools version 8.98 guides), specially for WebServices, as they are the new thing.

<value columnNumber="1"> p First, for application servers such as WebSphere you can have a single EAR which contains one (or more) WARs and one (or more) EJB JARs and each WAR and JAR may be deployed to different servers. Hence this need not be a question as to how many EARs, the deployment pattern is a separate problem. You may decide to produce two EARs, but that's not forced by the JEE specification as such.    
 
 p Second, at development time you do need to decide whether your EJBs shall expose a Remotely callable interface. This is first of all a design decision. APIs that are suitable for local invocation may not necessarily be suitable for remote invocation. For example, a very fine grained API may incur excessive message overhead - if we  strong are /strong  going expose a remote api then we tend to favour coarse-grained APIs.    
 
 p Third, EJB 3.0 does not fundamentally change the architectural and design decisions concerning whether a remote deployment pattern is appropriate. EJB 3.0 gives a much simpler programmign model over EJB 2.x, so have much less code/XML to write, but in terms of the resulting deployment pattern there is no actual change in what is happening in terms of processing or bytes flowing across networks. Not being a Spring or Seam developer, I can't be sure that Spring or Seam would say the same, but my guess is that fundamental architectural decisions such as remote or not would be technology agnostic.    
 
 p So what forces might lead you to deploy Web and EJB to different tiers?    
 
 p Co-location: Simplicity, fewer failure modes, reduced network over-head.    
 
 p Ditributed EJB/WAR: Separate scalability (you can add more processing power to the Web tier or EJB tier indepently), Support for multiple clients, the same business logic can be exposed to other client (which may also result in scalability needs ), indenpendent maintenance releases (patches to Web don't perturb EJB).

<value columnNumber="1"> p We are working on developing a Java EE based application. Our application is Java 1.5 compatible and will be deployed to WAS ND 6.1.0.21 with EBJ 3.0 and Web Services feature packs. The configuration is currently one cell with two clusters. Each cluster will have two nodes.    
 
 p Our application, or our system, as I should rather say, comes in two or three parts.    
 
 p Part 1: An ear deployed to one cluster that contains 3rd party vendor code combined with customization code. Their code is EJB 2.0 compliant and has a lot of Remote Home interfaces.    
 
 p Part 2: An ear deployed to the same cluster as the first ear. This ear contains EBJ 3's that make calls into the EJB 2's supplied by the vendor and the custom code. These EJB 3's are used by the JSF UI also packaged with the EAR, and some of them are also exposed as web services (JAX-WS 2.0 with SOAP 1.2 compliance) for other clients.    
 
 p Part 3: There may be other services that do not depend on our vendor/custom code app. These services will be EJB 3.0's and web services that are deployed to the other cluster.    
 
 p Per a recommendation from some IBM staff on site here, communication between nodes in a cluster can be EJB RMI. But if we are going across clusters and/or other cells, then the communication should be web services.    
 
 p That said, some of us are wondering about performance and optimizing communication for speed of our applications that will use our web services and EJB's. Right now most EJB's are exposed as remote. (and our vendor set theirs up that way, rather than also exposing local home interfaces). We are wondering if WAS does any optimizations between apps in the same node/cluster node space. If two apps are installed in the same area and they call each other via remote home interface, is WAS smart enough to make it a local home interface call?    
 
 p Are their other optimization techniques? Should we consider them? Should we not? What are the costs/benefits? Here is the question from one of our team members as sent in their email:    
 
 p The question is: Supposing we develop our EJBs as remote EJBs, where our UI controller code is talking to our EXT java services via EJB3...what are our options for performance optimization when both the EJB server and client are running in the same container?    
 
 p As one point of reference, google has given me some oooooold websphere performance tuning documentation from 2000 that explains a tuning configuration you can set to enable Call By Reference for EJB communication when they're in the same application server JVM. It states the following:    
 
 p Because EJBs are inherently location independent, they use a remote programming 
model. Method parameters and return values are serialized over RMI-IIOP and returned 
by value. This is the intrinsic RMI "Call By Value" model.    
 
 p WebSphere provides the "No Local Copies" performance optimization for running EJBs 
and clients (typically servlets) in the same application server JVM. The "No Local 
Copies" option uses "Call By Reference" and does not create local proxies for called 
objects when both the client and the remote object are in the same process. Depending 
on your workload, this can result in a significant overhead savings.    
 
 p Configure "No Local Copies" by adding the following two command line parameters to 
the application server JVM:    
 
 pre  code * -Djavax.rmi.CORBA.UtilClass=com.ibm.CORBA.iiop.Util 
* -Dcom.ibm.CORBA.iiop.noLocalCopies=true 
 /code   re  
 
 p CAUTION: The "No Local Copies" configuration option improves performance by 
changing "Call By Value" to "Call By Reference" for clients and EJBs in the same JVM. 
One side effect of this is that the Java object derived (non-primitive) method parameters 
can actually be changed by the called enterprise bean. Consider Figure 16a:    
 
 p Also, we will also be using Process Server 6.2 and WESB 6.2 as well in the future. Any ideas? recommendations?

<value columnNumber="1"> p WebSphere has a hierarchy of classloaders, parent  classloaders cannot see child classloaders, hence you get surprises when you put different aspects of your application in different places.    
 
 p Never attempt to place application jars in WebSphere's own lib directory, and never adjust WebSphere's own class path. There is ana rchitected way to make external jars visible, I'll explain that in a moment.    
 
 p There are three places that you can put JAR files so that they will be loaded. By far the the best is simply to place the JARs in WEB-INF/lib. You can specify the search order preference PARENT LAST so that these take prececdence over jars supplied by websphere - but note that some fundamental jars cannot be over-ridden You cannot replace the IBM security for example.    
 
 p Second you can add jars to the root of the EAR file. Noe that the hierarchy comes into play now, WEB-INF/lib jars can see EAR jars but EAR jars cannot see WEB-INF/lib jars.    
 
 p Finally you can specify a WebSphere "Shared Libarary".  See the Info Centre for how, it's very easy through the console. A shared library has a classpath, you add jars to that. Then you allocate the shared libarary to individual applicaitons or whole servers.    
 
 p Once again You WEB app can see the shared library, but i don't beleive taht the convers is true. Hence putting framework code in a shread library may not work for you.

<value columnNumber="1"> p If you want to deploy the application once you build it (I assume that you do) then you are much better off having an installed WebSphere server on the environment.  The reason you want to do this is that you will need to deploy the application using wsadmin (jacl/jython interface to WAS) and you need the WAS classes on the box to make this work.  You can in theory get it working without this but it is a lot more work and problematic in my opinon.    
 
 p Once you have it installed you can install the application using the wsadmin ant task, similar to the jython example shown below:    
 
 pre  code AdminApp.update("MyApp", "app", "[-operation update -contents " + fileToInstall + "]") 
 /code   re  
 
 p If you save this in a file called update.py you can then call that file from within ANT as follows:    
 
 pre  code   target name="-install-ear" depends="-init"  
          exec executable="${wasHome}/bin/wsadmin.bat" dir="target/wsadmin"  
              arg line="-f installApp.py"   
              arg line="-lang jython"   
              arg line="-wsadmin_classpath lib/commons-io-1.4.jar;lib/commons-lang-2.4.jar"

              arg line="WebSphere_Portal"   
          /exec  
      /target  
 /code   re  
 
 p Also note, that there is a version of ant that comes with WAS called ws_ant, this is useful in that it sets up all the WebSphere classpaths etc to make it work.  On my build environment I have pathed this ant variable so that it can always be called.

   p In speaking with IBM representatives 
  for our company, I have been told that 
  the WebSphere/WTP 
  performance/integration issues [1] and 
  WAS 6.1 support [2] are currently 
  being addressed and should be 
  contributed back to WTP with the 
  release of RAD 7. These bugs are still 
  in NEW status. Is there any work being 
  done on these bugs? What is the 
  expected target milestone?

So for now, without RAD7 (funnily, I personally find that RAD sucks like hell) or another commercial tool like MyEclipse, you'll need to attach manually to port 7781 of a running WebSphere server that was started in debug mode outside of the Eclipse IDE.

 blockquote  
   p Creates a queue identity given a Queue 
  name.    
   
   p This facility is provided for the rare 
  cases where clients need to 
  dynamically manipulate queue identity. 
  It allows the creation of a queue 
  identity with a provider-specific 
  name. Clients that depend on this 
  ability are not portable.    
   
   p Note that this method is not for 
  creating the physical queue. The 
  physical creation of queues is an 
  administrative task and is not to be 
  initiated by the JMS API. The one 
  exception is the creation of temporary 
  queues, which is accomplished with the 
  createTemporaryQueue method.    
 /blockquote  
 
 p The JMS API does not provide a way of dynamically creating queues (unless you mean temporary queues, which are a very different beast used by request-response messaging). If you want to create queues are runtime, that's going to be proprietary to WebSphere.

 p Load  strong balancing /strong  tries to be cleverer than that. Where some feedback on the relative load of the servers determines where new requests go.

  HttpUnit/HtmlUnit/Empirix/Rational 
  Robot, can I use Cobertura? /strong     
   
   p Yes! The process is a bit more

  First instrument your compiled 
  classes. Then create your war file. 
  Then deploy the war file into your 
  application server (Tomcat, JBoss, 
  WebLogic, WebSphere, etc). Now run 
  your tests.    
   
   p As your classes are accessed, they 
  will create a "cobertura.ser" file on 
  the disk. You may need to dig around a 
  bit to find it. Cobertura puts this 
  file in what it considers to be the 
  current working directory. Typically 
  this is the directory that the 
  application server was started from 
  (for example, C:\Tomcat\bin) Note: 
   strong This file is not written to the disk 
  until the application server exits. /strong  
  See below for how to work around this.    
   
   p Now that you know where the 
  cobertura.ser file is, you should 
  modify your deploy step so that it 
  moves the original cobertura.ser to 
  the appropriate directory in your 
  application server, and then moves it 
  back when finished testing. Then run 
  cobertura-report.

 blockquote  
   p  strong 3.11. How do I use EMMA in {WebLogic, Websphere, Tomcat, JBoss, ...}? /strong     
   
   p First of all, there is little chance that you will be able to use the on-the-fly mode (emmarun) with a full-blown J2EE container. The reason lies in the fact that many J2EE features require specialized classloading that will happen outside of EMMA instrumenting classloader. The server might run fine, but you will likely get no coverage data.    
   
   p Thus, the correct procedure is to instrument your classes prior to deployment (offline mode). Offline instrumentation always follows the same compile/instrument ackage/deploy/get coverage/generate reports sequence. Follow these steps:    
   
   ol  
   li use EMMA's instr tool to instrument the desired classes. This can be done as a post-compilation step, before packaging. However, many users also find it convenient to let EMMA process their jars directly (either in-place, using overwrite mode, or by creating separate instrumented copies of everything, in fullcopy mode); /li  
   li do your J2EE packaging as normal, but do not include emma.jar as a lib at this level, that is, within your .war, .ear, etc; /li  
   li locate whichever JRE is used by the container and copy emma.jar into its /lib/ext directory. If that is impossible, add emma.jar to the server classpath (in a server-specific way); /li  
   li deploy your instrumented classes, .jars, .wars, .ears, etc and exercise/test your J2EE application via your client-side testcases or interactively or whichever way you do it; /li  
   li to get a coverage dump file, you have three options described in What options exist to control when EMMA dumps runtime coverage data?. It is highly recommended that you use coverage.get control command with the ctl tool available in v2.1. /li

Just getting a simple proof-of-concept working here has been a nightmare (because of Java inexperience, WebSphere being awful, JAX-RPC being clunky, and lots of JAR hell).    
 
 p The new JAX-WS 2.0 web service framework in JAVA EE 5 looks great-- is there any way to run this without an entire Java application server?  For example, in .Net's WCF (Windows Communication Framework), you can host services pretty much anywhere you want (in-process, Windows Service, IIS 6/7 etc).    
 
 p What is the most lightweight way to wrap this library with some web services?

<value columnNumber="1"> p There has maybe been a lot of hype in the early 2000's, and what happened is the following: there has been a lot of attempts to create aspect-oriented frameworks, and these attempts have merged into two significant projects in the Java sphere: AspectJ and Spring AOP. AspectJ is complete, complex, academic, somewhat overengineered. Spring AOP covers 80% of use cases with 20% of complexity.     
 
 p If you look at Google Trends for terms  a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=aspectj%2C+spring+aop ;amp;ctab=0 ;amp;geo=all ;amp;date=all ;amp;sort=0" rel="nofollow" "AspectJ, Spring AOP" /a , then compare to the popularity of Java itself, you will see that the relative popularity of AspectJ is somewhat constant, but Spring AOP is raising. That means that people use AOP, but don't want the complexity of AspectJ. I think that the creators of AspectJ made a lot of tactical mistakes; AspectJ has always been a research project and has not been designed "for the masses".    
 
 p In the .NET sphere, we have seen a similar interest for AOP in the early 2000's. In 2003, when I started AOP researches, there were half a dozen of AOP weavers for .NET; all were following the path of AspectJ, and all were in infant stage. None of these projects survived. Based on this analysis, I built PostSharp, who was designed to cover 80% of use cases with 20% of complexity, and yet was much more convenient to use than Spring AOP. PostSharp is now considered the leading aspect weaver for .NET. PostSharp 2.0 builds on 5 years of feedback and from industry experience of AspectJ and brings "enterprise-ready" AOP (future will judge if this claim is deserved). Besides PostSharp, other significant players are Spring Framework for .NET and Windsor Castle, two DI-centric application frameworks providing 'also' aspects (aspects are considered as dependencies injected into constructed objects). Since these technologies use runtime weaving, they have severe technical limitations, so practically they can be used only in service objects (that's what these application frameworks have been designed for). Another starting project in .NET is LinFu, which can do 'also' aspects.    
 
 p To be short, the AOP landscape has undergone some consolidation last years, and probably enters the phase of productivity: customers will use it because it really saves money, not because it is cool. Even if it is very cool :).    
 
 p Oh, and I forgot: most application servers have built-in support for AOP. Thinking of JBoss, WebSphere, and, to some extent, WCF.

<value columnNumber="1"> p Firebird has a feature called  code EVENT /code  that you may be able to use to notify clients of changes to the database.  The idea is that when data in a table is changed, a trigger posts an event.  Firebird takes care of notifying all clients who have registered an interest in the event by name.  Once notified, each client is responsible for refreshing its own data by querying the database.    
 
 p The client can't get info from the event about the new or old values.  This is by design, because there's no way to resolve this with transaction isolation.  Nor can your client register for events using wildcards.  So you have to design your server-to-client notification pretty broadly, and let the client update to see what exactly changed.    
 
 p See  a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org/doc/whitepapers/events%5Fpaper.pdf" rel="nofollow" http://www.firebirdsql.org/doc/whitepapers/events%5Fpaper.pdf /a     
 
 p You don't mention what client platform or language you're using, so I can't advise on the specific API you would use.  I suggest you google for instance "firebird event java" or "firebird event php" or similar, based on the language you're using.    
 
 p  hr     
 
 p Since you say in a comment that you're using WPF, here's a link to a code sample of some  .NET application code registering for notification of an event:

 p  hr     
 
 p Re your comment:  Yes, the Firebird event mechanism is limited in its ability to carry information.  This is necessary because any information it might carry could be canceled or rolled back.  For instance if a trigger posts an event but then the operation that spawned the trigger violates a constraint, canceling the operation but not the event.  So events can only be a kind of "hint" that something of interest may have happened.  The other clients need to refresh their data at that time, but they aren't told what to look for.  This is at least better than polling.    
 
 p So you're basically describing a publish/subscribe mechanism -- a  strong message queue /strong .  I'm not sure I'd use an RDBMS to implement a message queue.  It can be done, but you're basically reinventing the wheel.    
 
 p Here are a few message queue products that are well-regarded:    
 
 ul  
 li  a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms811052.aspx" rel="nofollow" Microsoft MSMQ /a  (seems to be part of Windows Professional and Server editions) /li  
 li  a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/" rel="nofollow" RabbitMQ /a  (free open-source) /li  
 li  a href="http://activemq.apache.org/index.html" rel="nofollow" Apache ActiveMQ /a  (free open-source) /li  
 li  a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/" rel="nofollow" IBM WebSphere MQ /a  (probably overkill in your case) /li  
 /ul  
 
 p This means that when one client modifies data in a way that others may need to know about, that client  em also /em  has to post a message to the message queue.  When consumer clients see the message they're interested in, they know to refresh their copy of some data.

Most of the development has been in enhancing JMS function and performance.  The classes have been simplified and repackaged into fewer jars as well so it's easier to deploy.    
 
 p I'd recommend going to the WMQ Infocenter for the version of JMS classes you have (6.0 or 7.0) and looking for the Using Java manual.  Inside there is a section on environment variables.  Make sure you have the jars listed in the CLASSPATH for your specific version.  The infocenter is linked from the  a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/library/" rel="nofollow" WMQ Library /a  page.

 p If your intent is to use clustering so that the individual users sessions survive the loss of a server then you are going to need to pay some kind of transfer cost. You might:    
 
 ul  
 li Keep everything in a database. Maybe serialised as a blob. You need to housekeep those blobs when sessions timeout. App servers such as WebSphere have that capability. /li

I'm evaluating whether or not Spring MVC could be a possible replacement technology for the project I work on, which uses WebLogic and a LOT of custom-rolled J2EE code. The thing is, I've always suspected that our solution is over-engineered and WAY more complex than it needs to be. Amazingly, it's 2009, and yet, we're writing our own transaction-handling and thread-pooling classes. And it's not like we're Amazon, eBay, or Google, if you know what I mean.  Thus, I'm investigating a "simpler is better" option.

They answered that if you are talking EJB to EJB within the same server or server cluster, then use EJB RMI via IIOP.  With JNDI this abstracts where the bean is actually running (in a clustered environment).    
 
 p If you are going from one server (or server cluster) across into a different server (or server cluster) regardless of whether or not the target and source are in the same cell, IBM recommended that you use messaging or web services.  They felt that was a better method of abstraction between applications to keep them from being "tied" to each other.  They did say that you could get EJB's to talk RMI via CORBA, but said to do that ONLY if absolutely necessary.  And of course, you would need to know the IP and port number for coming in over CORBA (and that times each cluster member if in a clustered environment).

Due to some unknown circumstances (for me), connecting to the MQQueueManager takes 17 seconds every time, but sending and receiving messages afterwards through the queues  is not a time consuming job. As we are placing now a web service in front of the WebSphere, we came up with the idea of decorating and caching the MQQueueManagers and the MQQueues and verifying before each message sending if they are connected, respectively open; if not, we try connecting to the MQQueueManager, repectively opening the MQQueue (once again, connectiong to the MQQueueManager takes 17 seconds, opening the MQQueue is "instant"). So we are expecting that every once in the while WebSphere would disconnect the MQQueueManager (I cannot tell for sure as we cannot heavily test this for now, but we should be cautious) and the unlucky calling program would wait 17 seconds to reconnect. As things stand now, we cannot predict the occurence of this thing to happen. 
Our current implementation uses the WebSphere MQ classes for .NET. Is there any possibility for us to receive a callback notification when the MQQueueManager gets disconnected or the associated queues are closed?

<value columnNumber="1"> p With Windows-to-Windows connections, WMQ will pass the SID as well as the "short ID" which in this case would be "websphere".  This is a little better authorization than you get with non-Windows WMQ which only uses the short ID.  The problem is that someone on a non-windows server can connect using the short ID "websphere" and since there is no SID WMQ will accept the connection as thought it  em were /em  the Windows account.    
 
 p Two ways to address this.  On the QMgr host you can run setmqaut commands to authorize the SID you are actually using to connect.  The VM  em must /em  be able to inquire on the domain where the Windows account lives and the setmqaut command must use -p user@domain syntax.    
 
 p Alternatively, you can just use the locally defined ID in the MCAUSER of the channel like     
 
 p ALTER CHL(channel name) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN) MCAUSER('webaphere@vm')     
 
 p ...where 'vm' is the name of the virtual machine and you've authorized the account with setmqaut commands or by putting it into the mqm or administrators group.    
 
 p Keep in mind this is  em only /em  for testing!  Any channel with a blank or administrative MCAUSER can not only administer WMQ but also execute arbitrary commands on the underlying host server.  In the real world you would create accounts with access to queues and the QMgr but not access to administer and you'd put those into all MCAUSER values, then set MCAUSER('nobody') for all the SYSTEM.DEF and SYSTEM.AUTO channels.

<value columnNumber="1"> p The Sun Java EE tutorial is in my opinion too much tight coupled with Sun Glassfish and Sun Netbeans. The tutorial doesn't seem to explain that Java EE is just an  em abstract /em  API for which Glassfish is one of the  em concrete /em  implementations and that Netbeans is just one of the available tools (IDE's) to ease Java EE development.    
 
 p The tutorial gives a bit too much the impression that you  em need /em  Glassfish/Netbeans to be able to develop/run Java EE even though when you initially want to go for Eclipse or IntelliJ as IDE and JBossAS, Weblogic, WebSphere or even Tomcat as (application) server. The Java EE download basically just contains  a href="http://glassfish.java.net/" rel="nofollow" Glassfish /a  and optionally also  a href="http://netbeans.org" rel="nofollow" Netbeans /a . Most of the starters doesn't even know that you can also go ahead with just the  a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" rel="nofollow" Java SE JDK /a  and for example  a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/" rel="nofollow" JBoss AS /a  and  a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads ackages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/heliossr1" rel="nofollow" Eclipse /a   em without /em  the need to download the whole Java EE pack on top of that.    
 
 p Regardless, if you keep this all back in the mind, then the tutorial is quite good. It's only a bit too boring and tedious tutorial. If you want a pleasant read, then I can strongly recommend any of the related books of Bert Bates and Kathy Sierra in the  em Head First /em  series, like  a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596005407" rel="nofollow" Head First Servlets  ;amp; JSP /a . Or if you want to go in the professional Java EE 6 direction, then check  a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1430219548" rel="nofollow" this book /a  (yes, it covers Glassfish, but that's as of the moment the only production-stable full Java EE 6 implementation).

  J2ME (aicas, apogee), to full J2SE

  safety- or mission-critical systems, 
  but momentum is building.  Examples 
  include Eglin 
  AFB's space surveillance radar 
  modernization and the US Navy's

  deployment in the financial

   p If you are interested in RTSJ, I 
  suggest Peter Dibble's Real-Time Platform Programming, or Professor 
  Wellings' Concurrent

   p On a related note, there is also work 
  underway to provide a Safety-Critical

  Also, an expert group has formed to 
  explore a Distributed RTSJ DRTSJ,

<value columnNumber="1"> p IANAL.  One thing to remember: several projects explicitly draw a line around the "derivative work" concept to limit what it can entail.    
 
 p For example, every program that runs on the Linux kernel ends up including kernel code into the operating program because of the way programs run on operating systems.  To make it easy to write a program a header file is typically used when compiling the program so that it knows how to incorporate the kernel bits.  Linus Torvalds has stated that this use does not make the program a derivative work of the kernel.    
 
 p In other cases, such as PHP (and C, to a lesser extent) the language can not be claimed to be a derivative work of its libraries.  Sure, you can call  code strlen() /code  and, at link time or run time your program is linked to a library you did not write.  But the program itself is not a derivative work of the language or the runtime.  In many cases the library used merely exposes an implementation of a standard, and thus the program is not a derivative of that library specifically.  So your C program which calls  code strlen() /code  can link against any C library that has a  code strlen() /code  in it.  Your program is not automatically a derivative work of Glibc.  Even PHP has multiple implementations (The Resin webserver ships with a PHP implementation in Java).  So even if PHP were GPL your program might not need to be.    
 
 p A framework is really an extended set of libraries and the normal rules for libraries would apply.  For example, if the framework is one implementation of a standard, then maybe distributing it with your app is a violation of the GPL but simply using it would not be since your app is a derivative of the  em standard /em  and not this specific  em instance /em  of the framework.  For example, an application which uses EJBs can run on IBM WebSphere, RedHat's JBoss, Bea's Weblogic, etc, and not have to comply with JBoss's license.  Maybe shipping JBoss and your app on the same CD would violate the license for JBoss but your app is otherwise free of restrictions (unless it includes parts of JBoss in it).      
 
 p If the framework in question is not a standard and nobody else implements it, and/or you must include parts of the framework in your own code, then your app may be a derivative work.  Consider a linux kernel module: it is difficult to create a module which does not violate the GPL because most modules must include kernel code to get their job done.  nVidia sidesteps this by creating a proprietary blob which has no kernel code in it, but is not a fully functional module, and adds on some GPL glue code which makes it into a module.  Most kernel devs consider it a GPL violation to distribute both the kernel and the driver together (since you create a derivative work of the kernel by adding a module, but that module is not GPL) but distributing the module by itself does not create a derivative work until it is combined by the end user, who no longer distributes it and thus is not bound by any distribution terms.    
 
 p Keep in mind: not all projects have the same interpretations of the licenses they use.  You may be within your legal rights to use code a certain way according to the stated license, but you probably don't want to be sued, so when in doubt consult with a lawyer the original copyright holders.

<value columnNumber="1"> p A colleague of mine wrote a C# implementation of AS2 for one of our clients some time ago (he used .NET 1.1) so I can tell you that what you want to do is certainly achievable.     
 
 p To do this you would need to get a copy of the  a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4130.txt" AS2 RFC /a  as well as any other RFCs that the AS2 one refernces (the various HTTP ones for example).     
 
 p You will also need something to test your work against - some other implementation of AS2 that you can send your messages to.    
 
 p This is the approach my colleague followed and at the end of the process he had made an AS2 transport which has been in production for around 7 years, dealing with several multi-national companies who used Drummond certified products.    
 
 p You do not absolutely need to go down this track - you can send a valid AS2 message just by supplying the right AS2 headers in an HTTP post, but then you would only be implementing a bare minimum subset of the AS2 standard, which would not include the encryption, authentication and non-repudiation aspects of the protocol that make it worth using.    
 
 p If you only want to send AS2, perhaps with basic encryption and signing, this could be feasible.    
 
 hr  
 
 p I would, however,  strong strongly /strong  advise against you writing your own AS2 implementation unless you a) absolutely must or b) are sure you will only be sending basic messages with simple encryption and signing.    
 
 p I say this because:    
 
 ol  
 li The code is non trivial /li  
 li You will run into issues around certification /li  
 /ol  
 
 p The certification issue is possibly the biggest hurdle. All the big vendor AS2 offerings (e.g. Gentran, WebSphere, BizTalk) are Drummond certified. What this means is that they have passed a series of tests administered by the Drummond Group Inc. establishing that their implementation of AS2 can interop with all other implementations.    
 
 p Drummond certification is a time consuming and costly process, and without it you are always viewed as being suspect. Even if you implement a flawless AS2 sender, your code will always be the places fingers are pointed.    
 
 hr  
 
 p As far as alternatives go, there are several free or relatively inexpensive AS2 implementations like  a href="http://sourceforge.net rojects/openas2/" OpenAS2 /a  (only Java) or  a href="http://www.boomi.com/" Boomi /a  (commercial but not too expensive) up to full blown B2B engines like Websphere and BizTalk.    
 
 p I've not heard of AS2Box previously, but it does sound like it could meet your needs (though typically people using AS2 would not want to go through an untrusted third party).

These servers tend to listen on specific ports (80, or 443). The clients for these are generally web browsers like Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer.    
 
 p Examples of web servers: Apache, Microsoft IIS    
 
 p ' strong Application server /strong ' is a far more fuzzy, less well defined term. It could refer to any program providing responses to client requests for a given application.    
 
 p In the context of webserving, an 'application server' tends to refer to a higher level framework used to generate dynamic content. This could be some kind of container, within which you can deploy a particular 'web application'. Examples would include Apache Tomcat, WebSphere, JBoss etc.    
 
 p In both cases, the term could also refer to the machine hardware which hosts software to do these things.

<value columnNumber="1"> p The typical feature/scenario that you should look at is performance and speed.    
 
 p No matter what the white papers say, ultimately you need to benchmark and decide for yourself.    
 
 p I am biased towards  strong IBM /strong , because I worked there a few years ago. I didn't personally deal with jvm development, but I remember that the emphasis of the jvm development group was on the following points:    
 
 ul  
 li Proprietary garbage collection optimizations. This includes not only faster GC, but also more configuration options, like GC for server and client. This was before Sun offered similar options. /li  
 li Much faster (x10) native performance with the JNI interface. This was particularly important at the time when Eclipse/WSAD began to gain traction and swt was heavily used. If your app uses JNI a lot, then I think it's worth while for you to benchmark the IBM jdk against the Sun jdk. /li  
 li Stability and reliability. I think this is only relevant if you buy commercial support from IBM, like SLA for a service tier (WebSphere and db2, clustered environment, etc.). In this case, IBM will guaranty the stability of their offering only if you use their jvm.  /li  
 /ul  
 
 p Regarding  strong OpenJDK /strong , I recommend that you look at this  a href="http://blogs.sun.com/darcy/entry/openjdk_6_genealogy" rel="nofollow" history /a  of OpenJDK. My understanding is that OpenJDK 7 will be almost identical to Sun's jdk 7, so the performance is very likely to be identical. The primary differences will be licensing, and small components like webstart.    
 
 p  strong Oracle /strong 's jvm is useful if you want to run java code from within your database (via stored-procedure). It includes some optimizations that help the db run faster in this scenario.    
 
 p As others have said, Sun has been catching up on their competitors. I think that in the 1.4 days the differences were much more noticeable, but no so much today. Regarding jvisualvm, other vendors also offer similar tools, so I don't think that is an issue.    
 
 p Finally, there is one other metric (albeit a bit controversial) to indicate how serious are those vendors about their VM's. That is the number of related patents that they issue. It might be useful if you need to convince your boss, or if you like to read patents :)

<value columnNumber="1"> p I question your use of "kernel application", I think there's no such term.  s Either some code is part of the operating system kernel, in which case it usually HAS to be written in the OS's language, or it's an application, in which case it could be written in any language the OS supports. /s     
 
 p Now there are much used, perhaps "essential" applications, which some people might call "core" applications, like browsers, DBMs and so on. Maybe that's what you're talking about.    
 
 p Most applications have a visual interface. All the C/C++ programs have a look and feel that's more or less common and shared (a few common toolkits), and can be modified to some extent via settings in the operating system. Java (usually) "does" its own look and feel, and it usually looks a lot different from the otherwise common look; many people consider it ugly.    
 
 p Java's performance is meanwhile well on par with C applications, but that doesn't include JVM startup. It takes a relatively long time for Java programs to start up, and users hate waiting.    
 
 p A handful of database engines are written in Java. Derby comes to mind, and I think HQL. But that's not software users see a lot. Similarly, Web application servers Jetty and Tomcat are written in Java, and of course enterprise application servers such as WebSphere, WebLogic, JBoss, GlassFish. But again, these aren't user apps.

 p As I said above, " em goes well /em " doesn't really makes sense as this depends on the container you are using and containers might have different compatibility requirements (for example IBM WebSphere's J2EE 1.4 server may not work with JDK 5).

 p The J2EE 1.4 SDK is bundled with JDK 5 but... J2EE 1.4 requires JDK 1.4 or later. Java EE 5 requires JDK 5 or later. Java EE 6 requires JDK 6 or later (JDK 5 is at its EOL for 2+ months now).

<value columnNumber="1"> p So, I'm beating my head against the wall with logging again.  I know, how complex can it be?  Well, let's see...    
 
 p I'm starting a new project to be run on WebSphere Application Server 6.1 (actually Portal Server 6.1, but it's WAS 6.1 under the hood - whatever).  I usually use java.util.logging for my WAS projects and everything is fine.  This customer is a SLF4J fan and wants to use that.  Fair enough, sounds easy.    
 
 p So, I deploy slf4j-api-1.5.8.jar and slf4j-jdk14-1.5.8.jar in my WEB-INF/lib directory.  In my code I do a --    
 
 pre  code // These classes are coming from org.slf4j.* 
private static Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyClass.class); 
... 
log.debug("This is a log message"); 
 /code   re  
 
 p As expected I get an entry in the SystemOut.log.  However, it's the format of that message that I can't figure out.  A sample would be --    
 
 pre  code [12/15/09 15:43:15:071 EST] 00000042 MyClass D com.example.MyClass This is a log message 
 /code   re  
 
 p Let me explain what's in that sample log entry.  I assume everything to the left of  strong com.example.MyClass /strong  is coming from the j.u.l formatter.  Everything to the right of it is what I included in my log.debug().  So, who's adding the  strong com.example.MyClass /strong ?  Only thing I can think is that SLF4J is adding it before it passes the message through to the underlying j.u.l.    
 
 p It's the  strong com.example.MyClass /strong  part that's irritating me.  I don't want that included in the SLF4J-generated log message.  The class name is already included, so it's extra fluff that's not needed.  Plus, the real package names are quite long and their inclusion just pushes the real meat of the log entry too far off to the right.    
 
 p When I use just plain java.util.loggging, the log entry is exactly the same  em except /em  that the "com.example.MyClass" piece is not included.  Exactly as I want!    
 
 p  strong So, the question is - how can I get rid of this extra class name entry in the log messages generated via SLF4J under WAS? /strong     
 
 p Thanks!

<value columnNumber="1"> p I know of no easy way to deal with this. If the application provides an ant task build the EAR then the result should be a self-contained deployable application EAR. It is possible that the EAR requires extra libraries to be added to some class path, without documentation it's really hard to know what.    
 
 p This phrase is, I guess, at the heart of the problem: "Sometimes even after I check a particular class is there I still get the error." Exactly what do you mean?    
 
 p You are getting a class not found error but you can see the class in the EAR file? If that's the case then things are really difficult, and may well be some kind of classloader issue. I don't know WebLogic at all, but in WebSphere when deploying an application you have a choice of whether to give precedence to JARs in the EAR or to the same JAR in WebSphere itself. Some Applications demand one or the other setting. If there's anything like that in WebLogic then this may be your problem.    
 
 p Another possible problem is that the app may depend on infrastructure libraries (Eg. XML parsers) that are supplied by WebLogic, but expects a different version that is supplied with the WebLogic version you are using.

 p An application server is a component-based middleware used in server centric N-tier architecture. It manages the life-cycle of  components deployed on it, it provides services for state maintenance, data access (with pooling of resources), security, clustering and fail-over.     
 
 p AFAIK, one of the first application server (as just defined above) was ATG Dynamo. Other proprietary application servers include BroadVision, ColdFusion, etc. But none of them really survived to the advent of Java application servers (understand application servers based on the standards defined by Java EE and the Java language).

   p  strong Java Platform, Standard Edition /strong  or  strong Java SE /strong  is a widely used platform for programming in the Java language. It is the Java Platform used to deploy portable applications for general use. In practical terms, Java SE consists of a virtual machine, which must be used to run Java programs, together with a set of libraries (or "packages") needed to allow the use of file systems, networks, graphical interfaces, and so on, from within those programs.    
 /blockquote

 blockquote  
   p (...) so that makes application server = ee server = servlet container?    
 /blockquote  
 
 p No. To simplify, a Java EE server = Servlet container + EJB Container. Some server are only Servlet container (like Tomcat, Jetty), they don't provide the EJB container part and thus don't fully implement the Java EE specification and can't be considered as full Java EE servers.

I also took a full file backup of all of the applications they had on the old server.  The problem is that to re-install them on the new server, the WebSphere dialog asks me for the JAR/EAR/WAR file, which I don't have.      
 
 p Is there any reasonably easy way to simply extract the backup of the WebSphere application files I have taken from the old maching, and simply configure the new machine to use them?  WAR, etc. is a nice feature to have, but to be forced to use it seems silly.

Also, the directory where it actually runs the content from has a completely different structure (consisting of like a a %/Web and %/Servlet, where % is the context path of the application).  In the "Install" section, it doesn't even mention EAR or WAR, only JAR.

 p To help others, I'm posting all the steps I needed to do to get it working with Visual Studio 2005:    
 
 ul  
 li Install  a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=018a09fd-3a74-43c5-8ec1-8d789091255d ;amp;displaylang=en" rel="nofollow" WSE 3.0 /a , choose  em custom /em  and select everything /li  
 li Read  a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480575.aspx" rel="nofollow" Implementing direct authentication with username token in WSE 3.0 /a  for hints /li  
 li Relaunch Visual Studio 2005, now right-click on your project in the solution explorer, and you should have a  em WSE Settings 3.0 /em  menu item and use that if you want to. /li  
 li Update your web references, this should create a new HTTP web service proxy class, with a different name, e.g.  code YourWsNameHttpServiceWse /code .  This is essentially the same as running  a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa529578.aspx" rel="nofollow" wsewsdl3.exe /a  /li  
 li Use this new class, and you should have access to WSE methods and properties, such as  code SetClientCredential /code . /li  
 /ul  
 
 p I ended up doing almost everything in code, instead of relying on the config-files that are built with my C# DLL.  The code ended up looking like this:    
 
 pre  code FooBarHttpServiceWse wse = new FooBarHttpServiceWse(); 
 
wse.SetClientCredential(new UsernameToken( 
    "username", 
    "password", 
    PasswordOption.SendPlainText)); 
 
wse.SetPolicy(new FooBarPolicy()); 
wse.CallSomeServerFunction(yourRequest) 
 /code   re  
 
 p I created my own policy, which looked like this:    
 
 pre  code using Microsoft.Web.Services3.Design; 
 
// ... 
 
public class FooBarPolicy : Policy 
{ 
    public FooBarPolicy() 
    { 
        this.Assertions.Add(new UsernameOverTransportAssertion()); 
    } 
} 
 /code   re  
 
 p Finally, the WebSphere server responded that  em A required header representing a Message Addressing Property is not present /em , and inspecting the outgoing message (using the nice tool  a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/" rel="nofollow" Fiddler /a ) I saw the SOAP fault from the server indicated that the Action header was missing.    
 
 p I tried in vain to set the  code wsa:Action /code  element myself:    
 
 pre  code using Microsoft.Web.Services3.Addressing; 
 
// ... 
 
wse.RequestSoapContext.Addressing.Action = new Action("CallSomeServerFunction"); 
 /code   re  
 
 p The problem was that even if I set an action, when it was sent over the wire, it was empty.  Turned out I had to open the WSE proxy class and edit an attribute there:    
 
 pre  code [System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapDocumentMethodAttribute( 
    "---Edit this to set wsa:Action---",  
    Use=System.Web.Services.Description.SoapBindingUse.Literal,  
    ParameterStyle=System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapParameterStyle.Bare)] 
// ... 
public SomeServerFunction(...) 
 /code   re

 p Now, to use IBM Process Server, you'll need a license, you'll need an app server to deploy it (at random, WebSphere), some (IBM) machines, maybe some expensive connectors, some licenses for the modeling tools, etc. So I'm not surprised that IBM makes noise about it (even if don't really have the same feeling), selling such a solution must be a good deal for them (not even mentioning the consulting they will add to the bill).

Server is in java (WebSphere Application Server/7.0). 
Client dll in c#. 
We use contract-first approach. 
In Visual Studio 2008 I Add Service Reference. But instead of my original WSDL/XSD contracts it retrieves dummy XService.wsdl and XService_schema1.xsd and generates "not so dev friendly" code (with message wrappers, xFieldSpecified stuff, dummy ArrayOfx collections...). So what I do? I change Reference.svcmap so that it includes exactly original WSDL/XSD contracts and paste them from where they belongs. That's ok, I get dev friendly code and I am happy :) 
But what if someone change server contract? Here I can't just Update Service Reference. I have to copy-paste new contracts to my Service Reference folder any time contract been changed. 
To sum up, I need to add my original WSDL/XSD files As Links to all Service Reference folders in order to simplify contract changing process. Just check out new WSDL/XSD, right click Reference.svcmap   Run Custom Tool.

Shouldn't be too different with Jetty or any other Comet-enabled J2EE server. Briefly, the idea is: encode your Java object to JSON string via GWT RPC, then using cometd send it to the client, where it is received by Dojo, which triggers your JSNI code, which calls your widget methods, where you deserialize the object again using GWT RPC. Voila! :)

 p Message brokers offer guaranteed delivery (provided the server's up and listening), and you can do quite a bit to ensure that the system is fail-safe including integrated backup broker servers and instant power backup.  Broker queues can eventually run out of room if your app server isn't picking up the messages, but you can assign huge queue depth (100's of GB) and have the server send alerts if the messages aren't getting processed and the queue reaches a certain percentage.    
 
 p Your Java app would then run on a different server entirely, and would connect to the broker and pull messages off of the queue as fast as possible.  If the app server crashes or stops picking up messages for any other reason, the broker would just keep all messages in that queue until the app server begins picking them up again.

 p  strong Side Note: /strong     
 
 p When using JNDI, you need to set up JNDI environment properties like the  em initial context factory /em  and the  em provider url /em . Basically, these properties are used to declare what class to use to create the initial context and where to find the JNDI server. Obviously, the values of these properties are dependent on the JNDI service you're connecting to.     
 
 p You can specify environment properties by using the non empty  a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/naming/InitialContext.html#InitialContext%28java.util.Hashtable%29" rel="nofollow"  code InitialContext /code  constructor /a  and passing the  code environment /code  parameter to it. For example to connect to BEA WebLogic JNDI service:    
 
 pre  code Properties p = new Properties(); 
p.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "weblogic.jndi.WLInitialContextFactory"); 
p.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL,"t3://myhost:7001"); 
ctx = new InitialContext(p); 
 /code   re  
 
 p Or you can provide a  code jndi.properties /code  file and use the non-arg  a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/naming/InitialContext.html#InitialContext%28%29" rel="nofollow"  code InitialContext /code  constructor /a . For example, to connect to IBM WebSphere JNDI service, you would put a  code jndi.properties /code  file with the following content on the classpath:    
 
 pre  code java.naming.provider.url=iiop://myhost:9001 
java.naming.factory.initial=com.ibm.websphere.naming.WsnInitialContextFactory 
 /code   re  
 
 p This second approach is of course more portable as you don't hard code the values of the parameters in the Java code (this might not be an issue though).    
 
 p Now, in your case, I can't tell if you need this (and even less what values to use) as you didn't provide any detail on your context (like the application server or the JMS provider or the Messaging solution you are trying to connect to).

 p I'm trying to get some dojo/ajax working in a portlet running in WebSphere Portal. I have it working perfectly in Firefox, but when I try in IE 8 (both in compat. mode and not, and in IE7 mode using the debugger) the xhrPost sends back a 404 error. I can paste in the action url into the browser and the right page is shown, so I know that is right. I have tried stepping through the javascript debugger but I get a little lost when it gets into dojo.js. There are just so many attributes and I see everything that should be there (the form, the url, the load function etc) but I just assume they are in the right 'place'. It all seems to be ok until I get to the point where it returns a 404. I have no idea why it's not working in IE but is in FF.     
 
 p Everything is fine until I get into this code. For testing purposes I've changed the load function to be just an alert, and again - fine in ff, never gets there in ie, just alerts a 404 in the error:

url: document.getElementById("  %=renderResponse.getNamespace()+PortletConstants.ACTION_URL% ").value,    
handleAs: "text", 
form: document.getElementById("  portlet:namespace showResult"), 
load: function(data) {

<value columnNumber="1"> p A ClassNotFoundException is thrown when the reported class is not found by the ClassLoader. This typically means that the class is missing from the CLASSPATH. It could also mean that the class in question is trying to be loaded from another class which was loaded in a parent classloader and hence the class from the child classloader is not visible. This is sometimes the case when working in more complex environments like an App Server (WebSphere is infamous for such classloader issues).    
 
 p People often tend to confuse  code java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError /code  with  code java.lang.ClassNotFoundException /code  however there's an important distinction. For example an exception (an error really since  code java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError /code  is a subclass of java.lang.Error) like    
 
 pre  code java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: 
org/apache/activemq/ActiveMQConnectionFactory 
 /code   re  
 
 p does not mean that the ActiveMQConnectionFactory class is not in the CLASSPATH. Infact its quite the opposite. It means that the class ActiveMQConnectionFactory was found by the ClassLoader however when trying to load the class, it ran into an error reading the class definition. This typically happens when the class in question has static blocks or members which use a Class that's not found by the ClassLoader. So to find the culprit, view the source of the class in question (ActiveMQConnectionFactory in this case) and look for code using static blocks or static members. If you don't have access the the source, then simply decompile it using JAD.    
 
 p On examining the code, say you find a line of code like below, make sure that the class SomeClass in in your CLASSPATH.

 p If you would like to locate the which jar a class belongs to in a local path, you can use a utility like jarscan (  a href="http://www.inetfeedback.com/jarscan/" rel="nofollow" http://www.inetfeedback.com/jarscan/ /a  ). You just specify the class you'd like to locate and the root directory path where you'd like it to start searching for the class in jars and zip files.

<value columnNumber="1"> p EJBs are built on top of RMI.  Both imply Java clients and beans.  If your clients need to be written in something else (e.g., .NET, PHP, etc.) go with web services or something else that speaks a platform-agnostic wire protocol, like HTTP or XML over HTTP or SOAP.    
 
 p If you choose RMI, you don't need a Java EE EJB app server.  You have to keep client and server JVMs in synch; you can't upgrade the client without upgrading the server.  You have to write all the services that the EJB app server provides for you (e.g., connection pooling, naming and directory services, pooling, request queuing, transactions, etc.).    
 
 p RMI is quite low level when you think about it.  Why would you drop all the way back to CORBA?    
 
 p A better choice is EJB 3.0 versus Spring.  It depends on whether you like POJO development, want a choice of relational technologies besides ORM and JPA, among other things.    
 
 p You can pay for a Java EE app server (e.g., WebLogic, WebSphere) or use an open source one (JBOSS, Glassfish, Tomcat and OpenEJB and ActiveMQ), or you can stick to Spring and deploy on Tomcat, Jetty, Resin or any other servlet/JSP engine.    
 
 p Spring offers a lot of choice by being technology agnostic: persistence (Hibernate, iBatis, JDBC, JDO, JPA, TopLink), remoting (HTTP, Hessian, Burlap, RMI, SOAP web service), etc.      
 
 p EJB 3.0 is a spec with many vendors; Spring can only be had from Spring Source.    
 
 p I would recommend  a href="http://www.springsource.org/" rel="nofollow" Spring /a .  It's very solid, has lots of traction, isn't going anywhere.    It leaves all your options open.      
 
 p Web services are great in theory, but there are some gotchas that you need to watch out for:     
 
 ol  
 li Latency.  Fowler's first law of distributed objects: "Don't!"  An architecture consisting of lots of fine-grained distributed SOAP services will be elegant, beautiful, and slow as molasses.  Think carefully before distributing. /li  
 li Marshalling from XML to objects and back consumes CPU cycles that aren't providing any business value besides allowing your clients to speak a platform-agnostic protocol.   /li  
 li SOAP is a standard that is becoming more bloated and complex every day, but it has lots of tool support.  Vendors like it because it helps drive sales of ESBs.  REST is simple but not as well understood.  It's not supported by tools. /li  
 /ol  
 
 p Spring's web service module is very good, but do be careful about choosing to deploy this way. Write in terms of POJO service interfaces.  These will allow you to get the conceptual isolation you want, defer the deployment choice until the last moment, and let you change your mind if the first thought doesn't perform well.

 p Last year I started working at a medium-sized auto insurance company -- we're in several states, but we're not as big as GEICO or Progressive or anything like that (yet).  Our primary software system is old (written in RPG) but reasonably stable.  We're wanting to make our in-house applications available via the web (both intra- and internet), and we're going to be writing new Java code to access the underlying programs.    
 
 p I've heard a lot about Enterprise Java Beans , and it seems like there's times they may be beneficial (depending on which article I'm reading to research them).  However, I've looked into them and I just can't seem to get a grasp on how to started.  I've looked up lots of tutorials, but (like a lot of programming areas) they're either to simplistic to give me any idea of how EJB's could benefit my projects or they're too complex and my eyes start to glaze over.  It's a little disheartening, as I've worked with Java for about a decade now and I felt that I was at least able to easily catch on to things I didn't know about.    
 
 p So, here's the questions I have:    
 
 ol  
 li How can I tell if using EJB's would be of any benefit to any development projects I'm working on? /li  
 li If I'm designing an application from scratch, what would be a good way to implement EJB's -- or what would be a good way to look at my application to start designing EJB's? /li  
 li What questions  em should /em  I be asking, if either of these others aren't really appropriate? /li  
 /ol  
 
 p We're using WebSphere (6.1) as our primary deployment server, and most of the Java development is done in IBM Rational Application Developer (7.1, I believe) -- it's a flavor of Eclipse, for anyone who's never heard of it before.

<value columnNumber="1"> p It seems like for your configuration, container-managed transactions are used by default. In this case you need to define a way of transaction synchronization so the persistence layer is notified (and can update the 2nd level cache for example). So you need to define  a href="http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/core/3.3/reference/en/html/session-configuration.html#configuration-hibernatejdbc" rel="nofollow"  code manager_lookup_class /code  /a  property as following:

hibernate.transaction.manager_lookup_class=org.hibernate.transaction.SunONETransactionManagerLookup 
// For WebSpere: 
hibernate.transaction.manager_lookup_class=org.hibernate.transaction.WebSphereExtendedJTATransactionLookup 
// For JBoss:

// For OpenEJB: 
hibernate.transaction.manager_lookup_class=org.apache.openejb.hibernate.TransactionManagerLookup 
 /code   re  
 
 p Also you have to mark business methods that access data layer as "transactional". For that you need to mark them with  code @javax.ejb.TransactionAttribute(REQUIRED) /code  (see  a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/tutorial/1_3-fcs/doc/Transaction3.html" rel="nofollow" here /a  for more information about this annotation).    
 
 p You also have an option to switch to bean-managed transactions. You can do it by saying:    
 
 p  code hibernate.transaction.factory_class=org.hibernate.transaction.JTATransactionFactory /code     
 
 p Then the bean is responsible for starting/ending the transaction:

org.hibernate.Transaction tx = null; 
try { 
    tx = session.beginTransaction(); 
    session.createQuery(...); // do some staff

<value columnNumber="1"> p Here is some interesting information about optimizing the serving of static pages: br  
There are many ways to serve static files as part of your WebSphere application. br  
1. WebSphere can be used as your Web server, so users connect directly to WebSphere and it serves static and dynamic pages. br  
2. Alternatively, you can configure an IHS instance, which will be used as your Web server and then forward the static and dynamic requests to WebSphere through WebSphere's Web server plug-in. br  
3. Another option is to serve the static files directly with IHS, forwarding only the dynamic pages to be handled by WebSphere.     
 
 p Option #2 may be a better choice for many applications, especially those that are updated frequently, (since static files from the WAR file must be recopied to the IHS directory), or if the static content needs to be protected.  In order to optimize performance, the WebSphere Web-server plug-in has a feature called the Edge Side Include (ESI) cache, and is configured through the plugin-cfg.xml file.  The ESI processor has the ability to cache whole pages, as well as fragments, providing a higher cache hit ratio. The cache implemented by the ESI processor is an in-memory cache, not a disk cache, therefore, the cache entries are not saved when the Web server is restarted.

 p I would like that a client, whenever he wants to call my web application, that he has to send username and password so in can check it in the database and confirm his log in. The main thing of user loging in is that when client calls a function on my webservice, lets say "getBooks", the server returns him only the books he can see. "getBooks" function doesn't request any parameters, because he is loged in. When the user logs in i would create the session but i still need the user name and password. Any ideas how to request them?

<value columnNumber="1"> p I don't think these platforms are replacing old-fashioned programming, because they target a different market. In the past they were specialised in connecting enterprise applications (EAI), but recently they have moved in the business process modelling/automation space, taking business from ERPs, like SAP and Oracle Applications. They remain 'consultancyware' for large companies, although Oracle have started developing new applications on their Fusion platform. br/  
Of course working with them can provide a good living. Java is a good base for most of the EAI/BPM/SOA/whatever platforms, as they are built on Java (except e.g. TIBCO iProcess or MS BizTalk). They are meant for the same thing, but there are big differences in their implementation philosophy. Some of the vendors I had experience with:    
 
 ul  
 li TIBCO  ;amp; WebMethods (Software AG): their own framework(s). Development is very visual and intuitive, you'll rarely need Java coding to do anything. /li  
 li Oracle  ;amp; IBM: running on Java EE servers (Weblogic/WebSphere). Development is graphical, administration is the same as Java EE administration. /li  
 li Vitria: their own framework, based on CORBA. Only a thin graphical layer, you are practically writing Java code all the time. /li  
 li Sonic (Progress Software): like Vitria, just with webservices instead of CORBA /li  
 /ul  
 
 p Oracle and IBM are the biggest on the market (Oracle is really pushing now with Fusion 11g). TIBCO and WebMethods have better products (in my own biased opinion), but they are smaller, cannot sell as much as the big boys. Vitria and Sonic were big, but now only niche market. br/  
It's your choice which one to start with, but beware, each vendor have a huge, often overlapping portfolio of software from all kind of acquisitions. You can spend years just to get familiar with the products of one vendor. 
Probably the most popular products are:    
 
 ul  
 li TIBCO: BusinessWorks, iProcess, ActiveMatrix Service Bus /li  
 li WebMethods: IntegrationServer, BPMS, Trading Networks /li  
 li Oracle: Fusion BPEL, Service Bus (you mentioned WLI, but I think it is dead) /li  
 li IBM: too many products and they are regularly renamed, so I don't know anymore /li  
 /ul  
 
 p My advice is to start with the basics. They all use SOAP and JMS for messaging. They all use XML Schemas, XSLT (or XQuery) for data modelling/transforming. They all implement and extend standards like BPEL and BPMN. They all claim to be the best for SOA - but don't forget, SOA is rather a business model than a technical model and it is independent from vendors. br/  
Also, when you move from programming to integration, expect to use your communication skills more. Working in integration means you spend 50% of the time gathering requirements, 30% designing and only 20% implementing.

 p Now, in your case (as I understood you want to use an embedded database that will be bundled with your application), I don't think you should configure a datasource at the application server level. You should just package the jar of your database in your application with a standalone connection pool like c3p0 or DBCP.

 p They key is that you authenticate using SSL and SSLPEER or an exit.  But the user can still present any ID and it is accepted.  You enforce the authentication against a particular user ID by placing the ID in the MCAUSER field of the channel.  If it's a channel with only one authorized user, hard code this.  If the channel has many authorized users, use an exit such as BlockIP2 from  a href="http://mrmq.dk" rel="nofollow" http://mrmq.dk /a  to map the SSL DN to an ID and set the MCAUSER at connect time.

 p The actual code calling the service is nearly identical in both cases.    
 
 p To answer your question, though, I think it's important to stick with the current way of doing things.  Microsoft kinda makes this clear by forcing you to go through a couple levels of dialogs before you can even add a old school Web Reference (at least in VS2008).      
 
 p I think the WCF way is more flexible, and the configuration is a lot more descriptive about what's going on.    
 
 p Also, as you add new WCF components to your apps, it'll be nice to keep your configuration settings consistent, instead of mixing and matching between old school and WCF.

It is very difficult to tell from the stack trace provided which category this falls into.  Note that this is not a WebSphere MQ thing, but rather a JMS thing.  As a best practice, always print JMS linked exceptions!    
 
 p There's a code snippet showing this here:

<value columnNumber="1"> p You might be able to use the "Message Queue Task" in conjunction with some other host bridge.  Here's what I found while trolling the Internet:    
 
 p SSIS does not support loading into/from IBM MQ Series directly out of the box. ETI is the only known Microsoft partner or other 3rd party that can handle reading and writing to IBM MQ Series.  This is handled via native sequential (MQSeries Queue Message)through their Built-to-Order connectivity process. SSIS customers also have the below ways of integrating their solutions with IBM MQ Series:    
 
 p 1.Microsoftâ€™s MSMQ-MQ Series Bridge that comes with Host Integration Server. MSMQ Task in Control Flow in SSIS can be used along with the bridge, which provides connectionless, store-and-forward messaging across messaging systems and computing platforms throughout the network.     
 
 p 2.Using BizTalkâ€™s MQ Series Adapter to push ull messages into/out of SSIS Data Flow Engine via various exchange mechanisms : in-memory: script component, or staging : exchanging messages via the file system or directly writing it into SQL Server tables and use a data source component to read them.     
 
 p 3.Using the extensibility story in SSIS: build an MQ Series source/destination custom/script component directly interfacing with MQ Series native libraries.     
 
 p You can find the original website  a href="http://ssis.wik.is/index.php?title=Data_Sources/IBM_MQ_Series_%28WebSphere_MQ%29 ;amp;highlight=mq" rel="nofollow" here /a .    
 
 p Here's a description of the "Message Queue Task" that I came across in a PDF comparing how SSIS and Informatica handle messaging.    
 
 p SSIS includes a Microsoft Message Queue (MSMQ) connection manager that enables 
connectivity to MSMQ message queues. Coupled with this is a bidirectional Message Queue 
task that enables an SSIS package to push messages onto and pop messages off a message 
queue. The messages can be in the form of text, files or the contents of SSIS variables. 
SQL Server Service Broker which is included with SQL Server 2005 (and therefore with SSIS) 
adds asynchronous messaging functionality to database applications. Service Broker queues 
accessible from any application able to issue T-SQL code which includes SSIS.

<value columnNumber="1"> p Before addressing the .bindings file, we need to step back a bit and look at JNDI - the Java Naming and Directory Interface - and how it is used by JMS.  The Queue, Topic and various types of Connection Factory are all run-time JMS objects with methods and attributes.  But you can pre-define them and store them in a registry where the JMS application can retrieve them using JNDI lookups.      
 
 p This is helpful because the objects are like coins in that they have a JMS side and a provider-specific side.  On the JMS side, any administered object looks about the same.  Regardless of the underlying transport provider, a ConnectionFactory has the same methods and attributes.  However, on the provider-specific side, the administered objects look very different from one transport provider to the next.  For example, the ConnectionFactory used with a WebSphere MQ transport will have an attribute for the Queue Manager.  No other transport provider has a "queue manager" so this attribute is only valid in a WMQ context.    
 
 p The two aspects of administered objects are the "glue" that allows JMS to work independently of transport provider.  In your code you just have to look up a ConnectionFactory and you get an object suitable to perform method calls against.  Under the covers, the provider's JMS classes use the provider-specific object attributes to supply context to convert the generic JMS API calls into provider-specific calls. Thus the connection object that you instantiate results in a WMQ CONNECT call which specifies a QMgr name, host, port, channel and a variety of other parameters.    
 
 p OK, I promised to get to the .bindings file.  I said previously that the JNDI lookup was against "a registry" and that usually means LDAP or similar.  But Sun engineered JNDI like JMS in that there is an API that your program uses and an SPI or Service Provider Interface that is used by the registry.  So, although JNDI  em can /em  be implemented in LDAP, there is nothing that says it  em must /em  be implemented in LDAP.  One of the base implementations that Sun provided right out of the box was to use the local filesystem as the registry.  In this implementation, the root context is a file folder.  Each context can store either another sub-context (another file folder) or object definitions.  Typically there is one folder for the root context and all of the objects are defined at that level.  The file that holds the object definitions is...you guessed it... the .bindings file.    
 
 p The objects in the .bindings file are represented in Name/Type/Value triplets.  So each .bindings file typically has many objects.  Each object has many attributes.  Each attribute has a name, a value and the type of variable that holds the value.  The best way to get a handle on the .bindings file is to sort it which will put all the objects and their attributes together and make it more human-readable.  For a list of possible properties, see  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.csqzaw.doc/jm10910_.htm" rel="nofollow" the manual /a .    
 
 p Of course, the .bindings file is supposed to be a compiled artifact and not intended to be human readable.  IBM provides the JMSAdmin tool to generate and read the .bindings file.  You can also use WMQ Explorer to manage the administered objects in a .bindings file.  These are also discussed in the manual linked above. There is also a (some say) good tutorial in developerWorks  a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/0610_woolf/0610_woolf.html" rel="nofollow" here /a .

As far as Java, maybe I can point you in the right direction. IBM supports both Java and JMS and provides a number of sample programs of each.  By default, these are installed at:     
 
 p C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere MQ\tools\wmqjava    
 
 p C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere MQ\tools\jms

 p The docs I found on the Python module appear to indicate that it must be linked to the Client or Server WMQ libraries and your error seems to indicate that you have the client bindings linked.  If that's the case, you must provide the connection info as the previous posted pointed out.  The Java and JMS code support either connection type so there's no linking to be done but you still must supply the proper connection details.  In particular, please read the chapter on Connection Differences:

<value columnNumber="1"> p By default, WAS (I assume you're asking about the application server, and not some other WebSphere product) has a global domain with a file based registry for users and groups.  The most simple solution to your problem is to add the users and groups you need to that registry, and map your roles to them.  You can manage this registry from the WAS Admin Console by navigating to: 
 br  
Users and Groups -  Manage Users 
 br  
or 
 br  
Users and Groups -  Manage Groups    
 
 p The potential downside to this approach is that the users and groups you create are valid users and groups for all applications on the server.  That is, the users you create will have at least "All Authenticated" rights for any application on the server, including the admin console.  This often isn't a problem (the admin console doesn't actually grant any rights to "all authenticated", and other apps may not either), but is something to keep in mind.    
 
 p A more complex solution is to create a separate security domain for your application.  This allows the creation of a registry for only your application.  The registry can be file based, LDAP, or a custom registry.  See:

 p And this note that you had states clearly that " strong Java SDK 1.5.0 SR9 Cumulative Fix was fully tested with WebSphere Application Server V6.1.0.23. /strong ". It does states that this CF would result in  strong "The cumulative fix for Solaris will upgrade to 1.5.0_17-b04" /strong .    
 
 p The statements imply that IBM would support this JDK version for WAS 6.1.0.23 that it is supported via the formal support process.     
 
 p Would this JDK fix the EJB issues for you is another question all-together? The error java.lang.NoSuchMethodError doesn't sound like one which is going to fixed as a result of this JDK Cumulative fix. I haven't looked at the error in detail though.

 p Your Java app will authenticate the QMgr based on its certificate.  That means the jks file you were provided must have either the QMgr's self-signed certificate or it will have the root certificate of a Certificate Authority that signed the QMgr's certificate.  In either case you point to the file using the -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore= as noted in the article linked above.  If the jks has a password, you will need to specify -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword= as well.  Authenticating the QMgr with a truststore is  em always /em  required.  The next part may or may not be required.    
 
 p The other piece of the puzzle is that the QMgr may require your app to present a certificate.  In other words, the QMgr cert is  em always /em  authenticated, whether the app is required to authenticate is optional.  If it is then you have what is known as "mutual authentication".  If the channel that you connect to has been configured with SSLCAUTH(REQUIRED) then mutual auth has been enabled and the QMgr must have your application's self-signed cert or a CA root cert that signed your app's cert in its keystore.  Hopefully whoever set up your jks file will have arranged for this already.    
 
 p Assuming mutual auth is required, then your jks will have, in addition to the QMgr's trusted cert, a private cert representing your application.  To get the app to fetch the cert and present it to the QMgr, you use the -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore= and -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword= parameters.  Note these say  em key /em  store whereas the previous parms said  em trust /em  store.    
 
 p My recommendation is to work with the WMQ administrator to set up and test the SSL connection.  The first phase should be to test the channel with SSLCAUTH(OPTIONAL).  This verifies that the application can resolve and authenticate the QMgr's certificate.  Only when you get this working would the WMQ admin then change the channel to SSLCAUTH(REQUIRED) which tests authentication in the reverse direction.    
 
 p I would  em highly /em  recommend that you use the WMQ v7 client for a new application.  This is for two reasons: 1) v6 is end-of-life as of Sept 2011; 2) the v7 code has a lot more diagnostic capability built in.  The v7 client code is completely compatible with a v6 QMgr and works like the v6 client.  You just don't get the v7 functionality. Download the WMQ client code free here:

Is this decision going to lock them into a specific EE container vendor (say WebSphere)? That is so 2002; very few people have  strong  em a real need /em  /strong  for it; and in fact, SOAP has been pretty much ignored by most practical, successful implementations. Unless they have a real need for more reliability than what it is provided by JMS or SOAP-over-HTTP alone, you are in for a trip.

 p BTW, what application container will you be using? WebLogic, JBoss, WebSphere? And which web service framework? Apache CFX, Axis?     
 
 p Architects astronauts will love to say that those are implementation details. Bull. Any decision on a system whose change carriers a great cost (or whose implementation carries  significant savings) is an architectural decision. These pretty much dictate how things will be implemented (and what the cost of change will be) so determining early on which you will be using is an architectural decision except with very self-contained systems.

 p The .Net functionality in WMQ v7.0 is  em much /em  better than in WMQ v6.   Among the options available are that client reconnection can be handled entirely in channel configuration.  Since v6 is End-of-Life as of Sept 2011 and this is a new application, I would highly recommend using the WMQ v7 client.  You can use it with a v6 QMgr but won't get all the v7 functionality.  Preferably you can use a v7 QMgr as well, then you get the reconnection behavior as a configurable option.  If you go with v6 now you will need to upgrade to v7 in the next 18 months if you want to be able to get support from IBM.    
 
 p IBM - MQC7: WebSphere MQ V7.0 Clients  a href="http://bit.ly/bXM0q3" rel="nofollow" http://bit.ly/bXM0q3 /a     
 
 p Assuming you will proceed with coding reconnection logic, you definitely want to sleep for at least a full second, and preferably several seconds, between reconnection attempts.  Failure to do so will flood the WMQ listener and execute a very effective denial of service attack.    
 
 p Be sure to include the WMQ reason codes in the log messages.  For example, if you are trying to put a message on a queue and get back a 2053 MQRC_Q_FULL it is usually a transient error caused by a fast-producer/slow-consumer problem.  But if you get back 2035 MQRC_AUTHORIZATION_ERROR then there's no chance of the program recovering without human intervention.  If the logged messages do not have the WMQ reason code, it is very difficult to determine the root cause of errors in the transport layer.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I can answer for WebSphere MQ but not for any other JMS providers.  In the case of WMQ there are several tools, including the Dead Letter Handler (DLH) which can automatically retry DLQ messages for transient errors like QFULL.  For example, a queue fills up and the inbound messages overflow to the DLQ.  The DLH will begin to retry these messages and as the queue drains it will automatically replace them in the original target queue.  Other tools are available as WMQ SupportPacs.    
 
 p The general rule of thumb is that you  em must /em  have some process to deal with poison messages.  Ideally this will be an application-specific exception queue because the system DLQ is shared.  I have seen a number of cases where multiple apps spilled messages to the DLQ and the support team for one of the apps cleared the entire queue instead of just their messages.  Not good.    
 
 p One other note of caution is that messages landing on the DLQ usually results in disruption of the message sequence.  For example, a queue fills and messages go to the DLQ.  As the queue drains, messages are replayed from the DLQ at which point they are interspersed with new messages as those arrive.  Ideally the app is not sensitive to message sequencing issues and each message is atomic.  This is the key to answering your final question.  Whether you use the DLQ depends a lot more (at least in WMQ) on whether the app is sensitive to message sequencing.  If sequencing is an issue then you don't have the option to let the messages spill over to a secondary queue and replay them while new messages are still arriving.  Better in that case to let the queue fill and throttle back or shut down the sending app.

<value columnNumber="1"> p Although there is a WMQ Java API as noted by the previous responders, WMQ supports JMS as well so here are some resources to get you started there.    
 
 p Take a look at this article:  a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/0610_woolf/0610_woolf.html" rel="nofollow" IBM WebSphere Developer Technical Journal: Running a standalone Java application on WebSphere MQ V6.0 /a     
 
 p Also, if you have installed the full WMQ client and not just grabbed the jars then you will have lots of sample code installed.  By default, these will live in C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere MQ\tools\jms or /opt/mqm/samp depending on your platform.    
 
 p If you need the WMQ Client install media, get it  a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171 ;amp;uid=swg24019253 ;amp;loc=en_US ;amp;cs=utf-8 ;amp;lang=en" rel="nofollow" here /a . Note that this is the WMQ v7 client and not the v6 client.  It is compatible with the v6 QMgr but since v6 is end-of-life as of September 2011 you should be doing new development on the v7 client and, if possible, a v7 QMgr.  There are a lot of functional and performance enhancements available if both sides are v7.    
 
 p You can get the product manual  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.mq.csqzaw.doc/uj10120_.htm" rel="nofollow" here /a  if you need it.    
 
 p Finally, please be sure when you get a JMS exception to print the linked exception.  This is not a WMQ thing, rather it's a JMS thing.  Sun provided a multi-level data structure for JMS exceptions and the really interesting parts are often in the nested level.  This is not a big deal and can be implemented in a few lines:    
 
 pre  code try { 
  . 
  . code that might throw a JMSException 
  . 
} catch (JMSException je) { 
  System.err.println("caught "+je); 
  Exception e = je.getLinkedException(); 
  if (e != null) { 
    System.err.println("linked exception: "+e); 
  } else { 
    System.err.println("No linked exception found."); 
  } 
} 
 /code   re  
 
 p This helps to determine the difference between a JMS error versus a transport error.  For example a JMS security error might be a WMQ 2035, or it might be the JSSE configuration, or the app might not have access to something in the file system.  Only one of these is worth spending a lot of time digging through the WMQ error logs for and only by printing the linked exception will you be able to tell if it's that one.

 p The 5th item in the tuple is the UID which as you can see is showing up as 0 for both files.  I've tested jython 2.5.1 directly and I get better results:

 p So it definitely appears to be a jython 2.1 problem.  Now the question is how to fix it.  I don;t want to upgrade jython under the covers of wsadmin in case it breaks something else.

<value columnNumber="1"> p In principle, yes WAR files should be portable across JEE servers. In practice I would not expect many portability problems, but it very much depends upon the details of your application and whether you've stuck very closely to JEE standards. Also, just deploying your app into a different environment (your dev machine versus a hosting environment) might hit snags, not so much a WAS v Tomcat as this environment v that environment.    
 
 p Possible issues, descending order of likelyhood:    
 
 p 1). Are you targetting the same versions of the standards.    
 
 p 2). Did you use any WebSphere specific extensions beyond the JEE specs. Most vendors have some extra goodies, did you use any.    
 
 p 3). You've hard-coded some resource (file, directory, printer, database) that is accessed differently on your target platform.    
 
 p 4). Did you hit a spec ambiguity? Is there some corner case where WAS behaviour differes from Tomcat behaviour.    
 
 p 5). You depend upon something that WAS or your platform does really quickly and your taget platform doesn't.    
 
 p My general rule for portability: always test early across your range of intended deployment platforms. There's nearly always some gotcha. If you find out early you can fix with little pain.

<value columnNumber="1"> h3 Context /h3  
 
 p I have a J2EE application running on a JBoss 4.2.3 application server. The application is reachable through a web interface. The authentication is done with basic authentication. Inside of the EJBs I ask the security context of the bean for the principal (the name of the logged in user) and do some authorization checks if this user is allowed to access this method of the EJB. The EJBs life inside a different ear than the servlets handling the web frontend, so I can't access the spring application context directly.    
 
 h3 Required change /h3  
 
 p I want to switch to  a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/docs/3.0.x/reference/springsecurity.html" rel="nofollow" Spring Security /a  for handling the user login.    
 
 h3 Question /h3  
 
 p How can I propagate the spring login information to the JBoss security context so I can still use my EJBs without having to rewrite them?

<value columnNumber="1"> p Hmmm...so many issues with the code snippet you posted, hard to know where to start.    
 
 p Using the WMQInitialContectFactory does not seem like the place to start with MQ. It adds a layer of complexity you probably don't want at this stage. I'd suggest using Sun's fscontext and keep the managed objects in a local file. The initial context you are using is primarily used to make a shared JNDI repository for many users or applications, however it's not supported. My issue with it is that the program first has to connect to the queue manager in order to get a connection factory which...tells the program how to connect to the QMgr!    
 
 p All those objects named SYSTEM.DEF.* or SYSTEM.AUTO.* should never be used for actual connections. They are templates that new objects inherit from. If they are useable you can't secure them or any objects created from them.    
 
 p Either the snippet is incomplete or you are confusing the connection factory with the queue object. The post says you want the TESTOUT queue but the code has only a queue connection factory and no destination or queue object.    
 
 p If you've installed WMQ server or client locally, you already have a bunch of good samples. The default location for these is C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere MQ\tools\jms\samples and they include both pub/sub and point-to-point examples. If you want an example that demonstrates creating the .bindings file, check out the article and sample code here:  a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/0610_woolf/0610_woolf.html" rel="nofollow" http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/0610_woolf/0610_woolf.html /a  The article explains some of the issues I just mentioned with the channels, client security, etc.

<value columnNumber="1"> p My company is a software solutions provider to a major telecommunications company. The environment is currently IBM WebSphere-based with front-end IBM Portal servers talking to a cluster of back-end WebSphere Application Servers providing EJB services. Some of the portlets use our own home-grown MVC-pattern and some are written in JSF.    
 
 p Recently we did a proof-of-concept rich/thick-client application that communicates directly with the EJB's on the back-end servers. It was written using NetBeans Platform and uses the WebSphere application client library to establish communication with the EJB's.    
 
 p The really painful bit, was getting the client to use secure JAAS/SSL communications. But, after that was resolved, we've found that the rich client has a number of advantages over the web-based portal client applications we've become accustomed to:    
 
 ul  
 li Enormous performance advantage (CORBA vs. HTTP, cut out the Portal Server middle man) /li  
 li Development is simplified and faster due to use of NetBeans' visual designer and Swing's generally robust architecture /li  
 li The debug cycle is shortened by not having to deploy your client application to a test server /li  
 li No mishmash of technologies as with web-based development (Struts, JSF, JQuery, HTML, JSTL etc., etc.) /li  
 /ul  
 
 p After enduring the pain of web-based development (even JSF) for a while now, I've come to the following conclusion: Rich clients aren't right for every situation, but when you're developing an in-house intranet-based solution, then you'd be crazy not to consider NetBeans Platform or Eclipse RCP.

The v5.3 QMgrs should be updated to v7 as soon as time allows.  Among other issues are that there are security vulns that were discovered after v5.3 went EOL so no patches were ever produced to address them at v5.3.

If my connection request does not specify a QMgr name, then whatever QMgr I connect to should accept the connection.

<value columnNumber="1"> p Yes!  The Perl modules are a thin veneer over the WMQ API and expose all the basic options and most of the really esoteric stuff as well.    
 
 p When you open a queue, WebSphere MQ performs name resolution on the values you provide for Queue and QMgr names.  If you provide both a Queue and a QMgr name then the object reference is fully qualified and WMQ will attempt to open it as named.  So if the name you provide is the local QMgr and the clustered queue does not have a locally defined instance, the open will fail with a 2085 Unknown Object Name.    
 
 p The trick to opening a clustered queue is to provide a null value for the QMgr name.  This causes name resolution to check the local QMgr for a queue of the same name, then finding none it checks the cluster repository and resolve the open to the clustered queue.  Note that the queue must be advertised to the cluster for this to work.  Specifically, the CLUSTER or CLUSNL attribute of the target queue must be non-blank and refer to a cluster that the source QMgr participates in.  Similarly, the destination QMgr must also participate in the same cluster as the source QMgr.    
 
 p Note also that if you specify a QMgr name on the open that is  em not /em  the local QMgr, then WMQ will attempt to resolve the QMgr name only.  If it can resolve a route to that QMgr then it will send the message there.  This means that in a cluster you can send a message to any queue on any QMgr so long as you know the fully-qualified name.    
 
 p Finally, you can define a local alias over a clustered queue.  For example if you are on QMGRA and DEF QA(TARGET.QUEUE) TARGQ(TARGET.QUEUE) and then on QMGRB and QMGRC in the same cluster you DEF QL(TARGET.QUEUE) CLUSTER(MYCLUS) then it is possible to open QMGR=QMGRA QUEUE=TARGET.QUEUE and still have it work as expected.  Note that the alias is NOT advertised to the cluster but the target queue is.  The only issue with this approach is that the first time it is opened the API call may fail if the cluster query takes too long.  When I do this in Production, I always use amqsput on the alias ahead of time to make the QMgr query the repository before the actual application opens the queue.  Why would you do this?  If security is a concern you probably don't want to authorize all apps directly to the cluster XMitQ because, as noted above, they could then put a message onto  em any /em  queue on any QMgr in the cluster, including SYSTEM.ADMIN.COMMAND.QUEUE.  The alias gives you a place to hang authorizations and restrict the user to specific destinations in the cluster.    
 
 p So short answer, make sure you provide a null QMgr name on the Open call or set up a local alias over the clustered queue.  For more about the security aspects of this, see the WMQ Security presentation at  a href="http://t-rob.net/links" rel="nofollow" http://t-rob.net/links /a

So one fact is, that you get the new features much earlier with Spring that with JavaEE (e.g. container integration testing is a new feature in JavaEE 6 and has been available in Spring for ages).    
 
 p The most important point IMHO is the one of lifecycles for administration and development. When you choose JavaEE, you tie your programming model to your infrastructure. Usually app server vendors are not the fastest adopting new standard's versions (blame WebSphere, JBoss, what have you). So this means we probably won't see production ready, JavaEE 6 supporting products by the big vendors before end of the year.     
 
 p Even if that is the case then you still have to take the hurdle of your administration, IT department and budget controlling managers to be willing to upgrade to this shiny new version. Coming from this side, JavaEE 6 is not even an option to many shops. You can choose what ever you like to deploy your apps to? You wanna choose Glassfish for production? Go ahead, try. Most shops aren't in such a "comfortable" situation.

<value columnNumber="1"> p Great that you are using WMQ v7.0.1 at both the client and server!  The trick to getting load balancing is in how you tag the channels in the CCDT.  When you build the CCDT file the QMNAME parameter does not need to match the actual QMgr name.  In fact, calling it QMNAME is rather unfortunate because it leads to the expectation that there is some correlation between that and the QMgr name the client connects to.  In fact, it is just an index for the client app to use while searching the CCDT.    
 
 p So when you build the CCDT for your 10 QMgrs, each will need a different channel name but use the same QMgr name for all.  So for example,     
 
 pre  code DEF CHL(QMGR01.CLNT) CHLTYPE(CLNTCONN) QMNAME(GTWY.QMGR) 
DEF CHL(QMGR02.CLNT) CHLTYPE(CLNTCONN) QMNAME(GTWY.QMGR) 
... 
DEF CHL(QMGR10.CLNT) CHLTYPE(CLNTCONN) QMNAME(GTWY.QMGR) 
 /code   re  
 
 p Then when the application needs to connect it specifies GTWY.QMGR as the QMgr name.  This resolves to the group of channel entries.    
 
 p OK, so that gets you failover but not load balancing.  To get load balancing you will want to set CLNTWGHT and AFFINITY parameters as described in the V7 docs in the section  a href="http://bit.ly/aKCNno" rel="nofollow" Examples of Channel Weighting and Affinity /a .  I would advise reading through the entire parent section  a href="http://bit.ly/crc9Yw" rel="nofollow" Connecting WebSphere MQ client applications to queue managers /a , especially the sections on CCDT and MQCONN.

 li Look at your target environment. Does it have useful support for one or the other? For example WebSphere has integrated support for java.util.logging, you can set trace strings through the console and WebSphere itself uses java.util.logging. So that often drives me to java.util.logging. /li  
 li Look at the common practive in your environment. Is there history and competence with one or the other? If all other apps in your environment use, say, log4j then it's probably best not to swim against the tide. /li  
 li Do you have special requirements? For example logging to a central message queue. Are there off-the-shelf extensions to either package that meet your needs? /li  
 /ol

<value columnNumber="1"> p This is one of those occasions where the differences in transport providers bubble up through the abstraction of JMS.  JMS wants to provide a copy of the message for each subscriber on a topic.  But the behavior that you want is really that of a queue.  I suspect that there are other requirements driving this to a pub/sub solution which were not described - for example other things need to subscribe to the same topic independent of your app.    
 
 p If I were to do this in WebSphere MQ the solution would be to create an administrative subscription which would result in a single copy of each message on the given topic to be placed onto a queue.  Then your multiple subscribers could compete for messages on that queue.  This way your app could have multiple threads among which the messages are distributed, and at the same time other subscribers independent of this application could dynamically (un)subscribe to the same topic.    
 
 p Unfortunately, there's no generic JMS-portable way of doing this.  You are dependent on the transport provider's implementation to a great degree.  The only one of these I can speak to is WebSphere MQ but I'm sure other transports support this in one way or another and to varying degrees if you are creative.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I am using Spring with WebSphere 6.1 and today I started to get NET_BIND errors stating that port 1099 (port that Spring is using) is already in use and that Spring cannot use it.  I've been using that port for a long time and ran netat to make sure that 1099 wasn't listed (which it wasn't).  I also looked at the ports configured for my websphere server and 1099 wasn't listed there either.  So my question is:    
 
 p 1)  How do I figure out what is using port 1099 
2)  How do I reserve 1099 so that WebSphere doesn't use port 1099?

It states that as of v7 the TCP tuning is stored in the client configuration file.  So if you have enabled TCP Keepalive in the Windows registry, the v7 client will ignore it.  The format and location of the file is described in  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.csqzaf.doc/cs13350_.htm" rel="nofollow" WebSphere MQ client configuration file /a .

You did not mention which version of WMQ V7 client you have but the Fix Pack README files do show a number of APARs related to socket leaks, failure to clean up after disconnects and so forth. None of these directly mention C# or .Net but there are enough problems around connection/disconnection issues to make it worth an upgrade.    
 
 p So first  ;amp; easiest fix to attempt is to add TCP Keepalive to the client configuration file and see if it helps.  Disable connection sharing while you are in there as well.  It's not supposed to be a factor but then it's not supposed to leak sockets either.  Can't hurt.  Next is to apply  a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171 ;amp;uid=swg27006037" rel="nofollow" Fix Pack 7.0.1.2 /a  (latest as of this writing) and see if that fixes the problem.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I have spent the last few days attempting to integrate a Grails (version 1.3.2) application with an EJB 2.1 application that is deployed on WebSphere 6.1.  Once our grails apps are in production, they will be deployed to WebSphere as well.  The EJB 2.1 application is widely used across our company and, in anything except a local development environment, is deployed to its own cluster.  The way we handle this in our existing Java EE applications (all of which are non-Spring, non-Grails) is to bind a CORBA CosNaming Naming Context within each of our other clusters that can then be used to obtain references to our shared EJB 2.1 application.  So, up to this point, if one of our application needed to interact with this application, they would do so using an approach like this:    
 
 pre  code String cosNameBinding = "ejbApp.HighAvail.cluster"; 
InitialContext initial = new InitialContext(); 
Context fedContext = (javax.naming.Context) initialCtx.lookup(cosNameBinding); 
 /code   re  
 
 p Then do the normal EJB-style lookup/narrow/invoke using the federated/CosNaming context:    
 
 pre  code Object ejbHomeAsObject = fedContext.lookup(jndiNameOfService);         
EJBHome home = (EJBHome) PortableRemoteObject.narrow(ejbHomeAsObject, homeClass); 
Object service = invokeMethod(homeClass, home, "create"); 
 /code   re  
 
 p As you can see, there is a level of indirection that occurs here in order to go from the InitialContext to the federated naming Context that can be used to interact with the shared EJB application.    
 
 p Running locally, I have both the Grails application and the EJB application deployed to the same server (non network deployment WAS, same profile ;amp;node).  I have Spring configured like so:    
 
 pre  code beans = { 
        ejbJndi(org.springframework.jndi.JndiTemplate) { 
            environment = ["java.naming.factory.initial" :  
                           "com.ibm.websphere.naming.WsnInitialContextFactory"] 
        } 
        crewMemberService(org.springframework.ejb.access.SimpleRemoteStatelessSessionProxyFactoryBean) { 
            jndiName="hotelService/ejb/HotelService" 
            businessInterface="com.company.appName.hotel.HotelService" 
            lookupHomeOnStartup="false" 
            cacheHome="false" 
            refreshHomeOnConnectFailure="true" 
            jndiTemplate = ref("ejbJndi") 
        } 
} 
 /code   re  
 
 p And I can successfully inject ejb references into my Grails controllers and invoke them.  However, WebSphere can only resolve the JNDI lookup because they are both deployed on the same server.  When we move it to one of our development environments, we'll need jndi lookups for these services to go against the federated naming context.      
 
 p So my questions are:    
 
 ol  
 li Is there a way to do this with the classes that are provided within Spring and if so could you give me an idea of how I would need up modify my Spring config to do so? /li  
 li Given that there is no flexibility around how we deploy the other app or gain references to its services (we must use the federated context), should I consider extending JndiTemplate and do the necessary wiring myself? /li  
 /ol

All the difficulties of pooling, object lifecycle, threading, etc. were moved out of the application and into the application server on which they were housed.  Enterprise Java Beans were supposed to allow users to concentrate on the objects that expressed business logic and leave all that house-keeping stuff to the app server.  A market for app servers was born: WebLogic, WebSphere, JBOSS, etc.

<value columnNumber="1"> p There are a couple of different ways to look at this.  From the point of view of your application one connection factory can have many sessions.  Each session may have many consumers but units of work are scoped per session, not per consumer.  So more than likely you want one connection factory with multiple sessions where each session has a listener on a particular topic.  If you have a listener assigned to multiple consumers on a single session, any acknowledge (or COMMIT in a transacted session) commits all messages got or put in that session.    
 
 p From the WMQ server's point of view, one channel definition can have many running instances.  So you only need the one SVRCONN channel defined per app, regardless of how many channel instances it needs to start.  Try not to put different apps on the same SVRCONN though because you often want to administer or authorize the apps separately.  For example, with apps on separate channels you could easily figure out which app was misbehaving if you suddenly found yourself with 3000 running channels.    
 
 p For purposes of administration and debugging, I'd probably have one CF for the app side and one CF for the service side.  Each would point to a different SVRCONN channel as described above.  Inside the app server I'd stick with one topic per session unless it is valid for your app to consume off multiple topics in a single unit of work.  In the subscription you can specify a wildcard topic to get all topics below a certain point in the topic tree with a single subscriber.    
 
 p Just for best practices, I'd also set the CF to use FAILIFQUIESCE to make sure the QMgr can be stopped in an orderly fashion and I'd use SYNCPOINTALLGETS (or a transacted session with explicit commit calls) in order to improve reliability as per the JMS 1.1 spec, sestion 4.4.13 which states:     
 
 blockquote  
   p If a failure occurs between the time a client commits its work on a Session and the commit method returns, the client cannot determine if the transaction was committed or rolled back. The same ambiguity exists when a failure occurs between the non-transactional send of a PERSISTENT message and the return from the sending method.  It is up to a JMS application to deal with this ambiguity. In some cases, this may cause a client to produce functionally duplicate messages.       
   
   p A message that is redelivered due to session recovery is not considered a duplicate message.    
 /blockquote  
 
 p The SYNCPOINTALLGETS (a.k.a. SPAG) insures that messages retrieved from the queue are delivered to your app before being committed and permanently removed from the queue.  Otherwise if you lose your connection while the QMgr is trying to return a message, it's gone for good.  With SPAG set you might see the same message twice as described in the JMS spec, but you'll never drop one.    
 
 p For more details of the options available to the CF, queue and topic objects, see:  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.csqzaw.doc/jm10910_.htm" rel="nofollow" Properties of objects /a  in the WebSphere MQ Using Java manual.    
 
 p WMQ v6.0 is end-of-life as of September 2012 so please be sure to develop using the v7 clients, even if the server is at v6.  This will reduce your migration effort next year.  Download v7 client  a href="http://ibm.co/SupptPacMQC7" rel="nofollow" here /a  and the WMQ v7.1 client  a href="http://ibm.co/SupptPacMQC71" rel="nofollow" here /a .

 strong BTW, the CVS History was redesigned in this Eclipse version. /strong     
 
 p [ strong UPDATE 2 /strong ] OK, I found that changing the objectClass from  code org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.ILogEntry /code  to  code org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.filehistory.CVSFileRevision /code  do the magic and, at less, the popup now is shown, but when It's called, it's not working :-( 
I think I will need to change some code to adapt the plugin to the CVSFileRevision class.

 p I believe this has something to do with the resource bindings within the web.xml, but I'm not sure.  I have not created the ibm proprietary binding files and included those in the EAR, but rather am expecting that to be done as part of the deployment process.  In order to accomplish that I have tried telling it to generate new bindings while overwriting the existing ones, and other combination of bindings settings, but I always seem to get the error above.  I have provided my web.xml below.  Can you identify anything that looks wrong?  I have tried removing the id attribute for the resource-ref elements, but that didn't seem to help.

<value columnNumber="1"> p Within a J2EE environment (happends to be WAS 6.1 but could be any application server) I need to place a XML file, which is a configuration file, so that I can read and write to it.      
 
 p This needs to be available in a clustered environment so I am looking at using the class path to load the file.     
 
 p I am thinking I can store this file in the EAR root, reference it in the manifest and then load and save it.     
 
 p I have tried this approach by having my file in a JAR and making this available via the MANIFES and I can load the config file from the class path no problem using the following.     
 
 pre  code this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("configFileName"); 
 /code   re  
 
 p That loads the file that is in the JAR, which is fantastic.  But if I want to edit this file, programmatically, I cannot access the JAR files location (the EAR root) it returns me an interpreted path like this:    
 
 pre  code  /usr/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer rofiles/AppSrv01/installedApps/localhostNode01Cell/MyApp.ear/MyApp.war/TB_config.jar 
 /code   re  
 
 p That is not the correct location of the JAR the correct location is at MyApp.ear.    
 
 p  strong So the question is: /strong  how can I access and update (copy contents, create new, save, delete old) the JAR with my config file. br  
Or should I put the config file somewhere else?  
What is the standard J2EE to make files that need read/write access available to WARs on a cluster?

 p A slightly longer answer:    
 
 p There are JEE benchmarks out there, for example  a href="http://www.spec.org/jEnterprise2010/" rel="nofollow" here /a . I think it is very difficult to extrapolate from these to your real-world needs.     
 
 p In my experience the application's design and implementation has a far more impact on the performance achieved than the particular JEE server you pick. Also each vendor may have a "sweet spot" or some particular feature that happens to fit your requirements. So what's "best" today ma not be "best" tomorrow when your needs change or the vendors improve their products.    
 
 p Also note that making things go quickly is one challenge, but the other non-functional aspects such as reliability, fault tolerance and ease of administration are also important.

 li Yes, this does mean that anyone connecting to that channel is an administrator. On the other hand, this is no worse than it was before as demonstrated by your previous code working the way it did. /li

 pre  code  You have a (presumably) proprietory protocol exposed over a socket interface. 
 
 You desire to access the same function over HTTP, with a Browser based GUI. 
 /code   re  
 
 p Then I would approach it like this:    
 
 p 1). Consider whether to refactor your current code - In concept you have a "core" with a socket interface. What you need is the same "core" with an HTTP interface ... except maybe that doesn't nicely work? HTTP is effectively stateless, with request/response pairs. You might have something much cleverer with your sockets so some redesign might be needed, or maybe it just fits, or even you need to get really clever and use streaming, or Comet or something.     
 
 p So first decide on an approach. Let's take the optimistic assumption that a standard HTTP model works for you. Then:    
 
 p 2). You may as well use the servlet API, so TomCat or WebSphere Community Edition or any readily acessible servlet engine will do. Just write a few servlets that front your "core".     
 
 p 3). Tools, Eclipse works. Plenty of alternatives, but favour an IDE.    
 
 p 4). Especially when moving to the UI part, editing HTML, or JSPs something WYSWYG is useful. Things get a bit tougher if you want to do a Javascript-based UI - there are products out there but I don't think they're as mature as things such as Eclipse for Java.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I think that you are talking about different kinds of problems here.    
 
 p 1). Developers who don't read documentation. This is an endemic problem, not limited to SOA - just look at some questions on StackOverflow. At least the developer is asking you whether there is a service, rather then just duplicating logic in their own code. I don't see any technical solution to these kinds of problems, you've already provided good registries and documentation, but some developers prefer to talk to people. Maybe, even, this is actually a good thing - human interaction has value above the technical content of the interaction. Or maybe, you're too nice: "No, I won't answer that question, look it up."    
 
 p 2). Scaling. There are technologies addressing this issue. (Disclaimer I work for IBM, who sell some, so I'll reference these - I'm not intending to imply that IBM are the only vendor with solutions in this space.) There are products such as  a href="http://www.ibmsystemsmag.com/aix/augustseptember09/tipstechniques/25777printp1.aspx" rel="nofollow" this /a  that can provision a new machine, install a software stack and add it to a cluster to address workload changes. Then at a finer grained level of control in the JEE world the Application Server can dynamically shape traffic and adjust clusters. See  a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/extend/virtualenterprise/" rel="nofollow" WebSphere Virtual Enterprise /a     
 
 p 3). Monitoring. I don't "get" what you expect here. In all likelyhood such tricky bugs will require application level trace. For some problems such as finding memory leaks and performance bottlenecks there are very good tools, at least in the JEE world.    
 
 p 4). I can't speak to the .Net world, but I'd say that JEE app servers do a reasonable job of deploying the apps across clusters smoothly, and in the cases where we use JNI and need DLLs deploying then we can use products such as the Tivoli stack I mention to manage this.    
 
 p So, in summary, I do think that vendors are trying to address these issues. And I don't think your life would be simpler without SOA. Imagine instead the same problems applied to myriad separate, independent applications.

  3.0 project in eclipse, it asks if I want to create a client jar also. What 
  purpose does this client jar serve?    
 /blockquote  
 
 p An EJB client JAR file is an optional JAR file that can contain all the class files that a client program needs to use the client view of the enterprise beans that are contained in the EJB JAR file. If you decide not to create a client JAR file for an EJB module, all of the client interface classes will be in the EJB JAR file    
 
 blockquote  
   p My ejbmodule is added as a part of the 
  EAR file. So do I really need this 
  client jar?      
 /blockquote  
 
 p You do not really need the EJB Client it just provides an easier packaging to use the EJBs from a client.      
 
 blockquote  
   p Do I need to create both local and 
  remote interfaces? Or just remote 
  interfaces will do?      
 /blockquote  
 
 p If all your EJBs are in the same EAR then you can use local interfaces, if not you need remote interfaces. Local interfaces are more efficient, the calls are done be reference. br  
Some Containers (i.e. WebSphere) will optimize this at runtime for you and automatically call local interfaces if it is possible.      
 
 blockquote  
   p I decided to keep all the interfaces 
  in a project called projCommon and the 
  bean definitions in projApps. The 
  remote interfaces which the bean 
  classes implement are in projCommon. 
  So projApps is dependent on 
  projCommon.      
 /blockquote  
 
 p I would keep my projects organized by functional areas. Make local calls within the functional areas and remote ones outside of the functional areas, This allows you to later split the functionality to be deployed on different servers to scale it. It also keeps the code more modular.  This also avoids any circular dependencies.    
 
 blockquote  
   p How exactly are EJB's directly 
  injected?

 p EJB 3 containers provide the facilities to inject various types of resources into stateless session beans. Typically, in order to perform user tasks or process requests from client applications, the business methods in the session bean require one or more types of resources. These resources can be other session beans, data sources, or message queues.    
 
 p The resources that the stateless session bean is trying to use can be injected using annotations or deployment descriptors. Resources can be acquired by annotation of instance variables or annotation of the setter methods.

<value columnNumber="1"> p You added j2ee as a tag so I'm going to assume this is a java question.  You can implement single sign on in code by... well... writing code.  Use the built in j2ee authentication or roll your own.    
 
 p See this answer for possibilities:  a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/580646/single-sign-on-in-j2ee" http://stackoverflow.com/questions/580646/single-sign-on-in-j2ee /a     
 
 p The basic strategy is to invent some kind of shared cookie strategy that all of the web sites can read.  For example, if you are developing a single sign-on solution for xyz.company.com and abc.company.com, then deliver a session cookie of some kind from with a path of company.com.  Both sites can access this session and see "Oh this guy has logged in before."    
 
 p There are also strategies for web single sign on when you are authenticating users to totally distinct sites like  MySiteA.com and MySiteB.com.    
 
 p To prevent replay attacks, you will need to carry a common session store of some kind that your web pages can validate this cookie with on every page request.  You didn't tag this .NET, but in .NET this means you have to move session state out of the IIS worker process, which is not the default when you select File   New Project... for web applications.    
 
 p Your application will have to guard every incoming web request because you are now trusting that cookie as a "ticket" or "proof of entry."  You will need a strategy to deauthorize that cookie (on logout or timeout or other).    
 
 p Most web frameworks, including J2EE, .NET, or application servers like WebSphere, have solutions for this.  You will have to research them and get familiar with the techniques you need.    
 
 p You can also buy third party access software such as CA Siteminder.  In this case, you write no authentication and access code and you let their web agents stand guard in front of your app.  They also have single sign-on solutions for multiple web sites that may or may not share a common higher level domain.    
 
 p I am not explicitly recommending this product.  I am saying you have asked a very very big question and that you can use java to solve your problem or buy third party products that try to do the same.    
 
 p This is a HUGE topic that I have NOT attempted to cover in detail.  This is not a sufficient answer.  The point is that you will need to select more pieces of your architecture before you can get more specific help and guidance.

<value columnNumber="1"> p The main requirement that I run into is that consumers cannot compete for a single message on a topic.  For example, I have a client who publishes call center events.  Several systems subscribe to these events.  One of these systems is the actual call routing application which has multiple instances running.  If each instance subscribes then the call is routed to all of them.  However, if the message is dropped onto a queue and all the instances consume off the same queue then only one will receive the message and the call goes to that operator.  If the publishing application converts from topics to a queue, the call center works but all the other subscriber apps don't get the message.    
 
 p The solution (as implemented in WebSphere MQ) was to create an administrative subscription on the topic and deliver the messages to a queue that all application instances consume from.  So the producer apps are still publishers, all the dynamic subscribers still get copies of the message and the call center app instances compete for a single instance of each published message.    
 
 p Also, you can't use browse semantics on a topic whereas you can on a queue.  With topics you can specify selectors to filter the messages that are returned but that's about it.  With queues you can browse, reset the browse pointer and then browse some more.    
 
 p If you put a message on a queue and nothing is there to receive it, the message remains queued up.  If you put a message to a topic and there are no active subscribers or durable subscriptions, the message is discarded.  Therefore messages in a queue are naturally durable whereas messages on a topic may or may not be.    
 
 p From a pure JMS perspective, queue and topic are both instances of destination and are interchangeable if you don't try to browse.  An application may not know whether the destination it opens is a queue or a topic unless it uses instanceOf() at run-time to find out.

Many people grab the jar files rather than performing the complete install and do not necessarily get all of them.  In addition to insuring all required binaries are present, using the install media provides several additional capabilities such as diagnostics and trace.  It also assures that maintenance can be applied.  The WMQ client install media are available for free download as  a href="http://bit.ly/SupportPacMQC7" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MQC7 /a .

<value columnNumber="1"> p This question actually involves many concepts and I won't cover them all in details. For more exhaustive details, I suggest reading the whole  strong Chapter 5 - Entity Managers and Persistence Contexts /strong  of the JPA 1.0 specification (and the other relevant sections mentioned at the end of this answer). I will rather try to describe the most common scenario in a Java EE environment.     
 
 p Within an EJB environment, one would typically use:    
 
 ul  
 li A  em container-managed entity manager /em  (must be a JTA entity manager) br  
 ul  
 li  em transaction-scoped /em  in Stateless Session Beans (SLSB) /li  
 li  em extended /em  in Stateful Session Beans (SFSB) /li  
 /ul  /li  
 li JTA Transaction Management (and not  em resource-local transactions /em  unless this is  strong really /strong  what you want) /li  
 /ul  
 
 p Here is how a  code persistence.xml /code  for a JTA entity manager that uses a data source with a JNDI name  code java:comp/env/jdbc/AppDataSource /code  can be set up, OpenJPA being the persistence provider used by WebSphere:    
 
 pre  code   ?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?  
  persistence xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns ersistence" 
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns ersistence http://java.sun.com/xml/ns ersistence ersistence_1_0.xsd" 
  version="1.0"  
    persistence-unit name="MyPu" transaction-type="JTA"  
      provider org.apache.openjpa.persistence.PersistenceProviderImpl   rovider  
      jta-data-source java:comp/env/jdbc/AppDataSource  /jta-data-source  
      class com.acme.domain.Foo  /class  
      class com.acme.domain.Bar  /class  
      exclude-unlisted-classes true  /exclude-unlisted-classes  
      properties  
        !-- OpenJPA specific properties --  
        property name="openjpa.TransactionMode" value="managed"  
        property name="openjpa.ConnectionFactoryMode" value="managed"  
        property name="openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary" value="db2"  
       roperties  
     ersistence-unit  
   ersistence  
 /code   re  
 
 p For the OpenJPA properties, refer to the OpenJPA  a href="http://openjpa.apache.org/builds/1.2.1/apache-openjpa-1.2.1/docs/manual/ref_guide_conf_openjpa.html#openjpa.ConnectionFactoryMode" rel="nofollow" documentation /a .    
 
 p And here is how a SLSB (using Container Managed Transactions) could get a container managed Entity Manager injected:    
 
 pre  code @Stateless 
public class EmployeeServiceBean implements EmployeeService { 
    @PersistenceContext(unitName="MyPu") 
    private EntityManager em; 
 
    public Employee createEmployee(int id, String name, long salary) { 
        Employee emp = new Employee(id); 
        emp.setName(name); 
        emp.setSalary(salary); 
        em.persist(emp); 
        return emp; 
    } 
    ...     
} 
 /code   re  
 
 p And that's all. The life cycle of the entity manager is managed by the container transparently for the application (no createEM/close) and the entity manager participates in the JTA transaction managed by the container (no explicit begin/commit).    
 
 p As previously hinted, I'm just scratching the surface, my goal is somehow to put you on the right path. To go further, I suggest grabbing a book (e.g. EJB3 in Action). Meanwhile, the references below would be a good reading.

 p How you do this depends on the tool you are using.  I can provide examples from WebSphere MQ's JMSAdmin tool but others will have slightly (or wildly) different syntax. Since Sun's FSContext is used in both our examples, the context traversal works the same although our administrative tools may differ in syntax.    
 
 p Using JMSAdmin you can  code DEFINE CTX(subcontext_name) /code  and this creates a directory under which will reside a .bindings file.  You can then  code CHANGE CTX(subcontext_name) /code  to make that subcontext the current one.  Anything you define will now be in the .bindings file within that subcontext.    
 
 p In your code you refer to the subcontext as a path.  For example, after opening the initial context you can lookup an object as  code subcontext_name/foo /code .

 p The real trick is finding documentation on how to do the things IBM tells you you can do with the tooling. The documentation is often buried somewhere, or is lacking.

 p One lead we are trying now is reducing the reflection threshold to 0 (shutting off the bytecode accessors for reflectively created classes).  This app uses a lot of pointcutting and a lot of reflection, so we're hoping there's a good chance this helps.

<value columnNumber="1"> p Preface: br  
Most of J2EE applications are using container managed datasources through JNDI. This is fine as it gives one place for configuring these connections. br  
The problem arises when we want to use ORM framework (like hibernate) or something that have to know the default schema (mostly for Oracle, may be others too), which can be different from the username that is used to connect to the DB.    
 
 p I want to put the default schema name somewhere close to the datasource definition. One of the options would be to put it in JNDI. I will then manually read of from there before construction the EntityManager (well actually using Spring).    
 
 p As I found out there is a simple way to specify custom resource (in this situation it will be String with default schema name) in Apache Tomcat like this (correct me if I'm wrong):    
 
 pre  code   Environment name="schemaNames/EmployeeDB" 
             type="java.lang.String" 
            value="empl" 
      description="Schema name of Employees Database for HR Applications"  
 /code   re  
 
 p Anyway, considering this can be done in Apache Tomcat, how should I configure the same custom JNDI resource (of String type) within other application servers:    
 
 ul  
 li JBoss 4/5 /li  
 li WebSphere 6/7 /li  
 li WebLogic 9/10 /li  
 /ul  
 
 p If you know about other servers that would be great too.    
 
 p Also, as an alternative I don't want to put the schema name in system properties or environment variables.    
 
 p Thank you very much !    
 
 hr/  
 
 p  strong Update: /strong  br

If you want, there are also ways to wrap the .jar in an exe that handles any startup stuff that doesn't work well in the .jar (used to be used before they were reliably double-clickable, but I don't think that's been an issue for a year or two now).    /li

 p  strong Context: /strong  I am trying to create a JAX-WS client to call into the Human Task Manager and Business Flow Manager services in WebSphere Process Server V7, that are exposed via JAX-WS. By default they have attached Policy sets, and provider bindings that specify some WS-Security settings (as these are not defined in the WSDL).    
 
 p I have figured out how to make it work using a Dynamic Web Project. I have been able to generate the JAX-WS client code from the WSDL. I have been able to export the policy sets and provider and client bindings from Process Server and import them into my workspace. I have been able to attach the policy set and client bindings to the client service. I have been able to set up a page and a servlet to invoke my web service (to test the client). And I have been able to set up the security settings in the deployment descriptors and websphere binding/extension files to get it work.    
 
 p This is all wonderful, but in reality we don't want an ear with a war just to expose the web service client to our other applications we are writing. We want to generate a web service client jar and package it with other applications.    
 
 p Given this line of thought I have been able to figure out how to use a regular Java Project in my IDE and generate the web service client into it. I have also been able to attach the policy set and client bindings to the client.    
 
 p  strong My problem /strong  is now how to I invoke this?  I have created a dynamic web project with my page and servlet as before to test my client. I set up my client project as a web library dependency so it has access to the client code. I can even set up the deployment descriptors as before to force login and authenication. Only problem now is that I can't figure out how to pass the credentials to my web service now that it is in its own "jar". Before I had access to a menu to set up the TokenGenerator and CallbackHandler. Now, I don't have access to those menus as the client is not in the dynamic web project. So now I have a "disconnect" and it of course fails when trying to run it on the server.    
 
 p There has to be a way to do this. I should be able to generate a client jar and pass it what it needs. Anyone encounter this before?

<value columnNumber="1"> p Tomcat is merely an HTTP server and Java servlet container.  JBoss and GlassFish are full-blown JEE application servers, including an EJB container and all the other features of that stack.  On the other hand, Tomcat has a lighter memory footprint (~60-70 MB), while those JEE servers weigh in at hundreds of megs.  Tomcat is very popular for simple web applications, or applications using frameworks such as Spring that do not require a full JEE server.  Administration of a Tomcat server is arguably easier, as there are fewer moving parts.      
 
 p However, for applications that do require a full JEE stack (or at least more pieces that could easily be bolted-on to Tomcat)... JBoss and GlassFish are two of the most popular open source offerings (the third one is Apache Geronimo, upon which the free version of IBM WebSphere is built).  JBoss has a larger and deeper user community, and a more mature codebase.  However, JBoss lags significantly behind GlassFish in implementing the current JEE specs.  Also, for those who prefer a GUI-based admin system... GlassFish's admin console is extremely slick, whereas most administration in JBoss is done with a command-line and text editor.  GlassFish comes straight from Sun/Oracle, with all the advantages that can offer.  JBoss is NOT under the control of Sun/Oracle, with all the advantages THAT can offer.

If you haven't seen it already, IBM's main JDK page is at:   a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/" rel="nofollow" https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/ /a .      
 
 p However, the Windows offerings are pretty pitiful.  IBM hasn't released a new JDK for the Windows platform since early-2006.  That JDK was of the Java 5 generation, but there's no indication on the download page (or in the installer's file name) of an SR version.  I can't install it and check for you, because of the other Windows caveat of which I hope you're aware:  The IBM JDK will  strong not /strong  install on a Windows machine unless the installer detects an IBM BIOS.      
 
 p Given that IBM sold their PC division to Lenovo, I'm not even sure that it is possible AT ALL to install their standalone JDK on a contemporary box.  I would contact IBM support if you have a contract... they might be able to tell you differently.    
 
 p Either way, the preceding answer points at another possibility.  IBM frequently bundles its JDK/JRE,  i without the crazy restrictions found in the standalone version /i , inside of other downloads.  For instance, I know that WebSphere Community Edition (i.e. IBM's version of Apache Geronimo) comes with one.  Good luck finding the specific version you need... but if you do, and don't mind the possibility of violating some license legalese, then you can just ZIP up that directory and copy it to the target machine.    
 
 p This whole topic is a damn shame.  In terms of bechmarks and runtime performance, the IBM JDK/JRE has always been awesome.  However, on the larger "ecosystem" level it's always sucked.

<value columnNumber="1"> p There are countless ways to serve HTML from Java but virtually all of them rely on java servlets and java server pages (JSPs) which are Java's specification for handling web requests.    
 
 p The absolute bare minimum to get going:    
 
 ol  
 li Install  a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" rel="nofollow" Java EE SDK /a  ensuring to also install Netbeans and Glassfish.  /li  
 li Launch Netbeans and create a "Java Web" / "Web Application" project  /li  
 li Enter a project name, e.g. MyWebApp  /li  
 li In the Server and Settings screen, you need to Add... your server so do so. Point to the file location of your Glassfish server and enter the admin name and password /li  
 li Ignore the framework stuff and Finish /li  
 li NetBeans will generate a sample app and you can click straightaway on Run Main Project. It will deploy your app to Glassfish and load  a href="http://localhost:8080/MyWebApp/" rel="nofollow" http://localhost:8080/MyWebApp/ /a  from your default browser /li  
 /ol  
 
 p Important things to note:    
 
 ol  
 li  p A file called web.xml tells the host server some basics about your web app. This file can contain a lot of other stuff but the default is some boiler plate. The most interesting part says  code   welcome-file index.jsp  /welcome-file  /code  which means when you load  a href="http://localhost:8080/MyWebApp/" rel="nofollow" http://localhost:8080/MyWebApp/ /a  it will default to load index.jsp.    /li  
 li  p The index.jsp is what gets loaded if you don't specify a page to the server. If you look at index.jsp it's just HTML with some JSP markup.

      /body  
  /html  
 /code   re  /li  
 li  p Creating new JSPs is as simple as writing HTML. Netbeans has a wizard to create a simple JSP.     /li  
 li  p You can embed chunks of Java into a .jsp easily and step in and out of Java / HTML with the   % %  notation such as     
 
 p   % 
for (int i = 0; i    10; i++) { 
%  
Hello   %=i%  br  
  % } %     /li  
 li  p Glassfish is just one possible app server. As long as you write compliant code it should functional with only minimal or zero modifications on any other implementation of Java Servlet / JSP spec. e.g. Jetty, Tomcat, oc4j, JBoss, WebSphere etc.     /li  
 li  p This is just the tip of the iceberg. You can make things as simple or complex as you like.     /li  
 /ol  
 
 p Once you know the basics then it's up to you how deep you go. More advanced topics would be:    
 
 ol  
 li Taglibraries - these can remove a lot of java clutter and are considered more correct /li  
 li Expressions - using expressions inside JSP pages to reduce the need for messy   %= notation /li  
 li Custom servlets let you move model / business stuff into a Java class and leave the .jsp to just presentational /li  
 li MVC web frameworks like Struts, Spring etc. /li  
 li Security  ;amp; filtering /li  
 /ol

 p You have support for BuildForge and it integrates with other IBM software like ClearCase. Theoretically you have only to deal with one vendor if something in the chain does not work, but IBM has different support teams for their products and you might become their ping pong ball. :(    
 
 p Hudson is open source (if you like that), that means you can get the source and modify it to serve you better. But the release cycle is very short (about 1 week, agile development). There is a more stable version with support available now (for cash of course) from the company of the main author of Hudson.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I'm not sure what you're asking here so I'm answering with the risk of completely missing the point.    
 
 p The question in the title - "Where is Web Container's default locale defined?" - well, that's up to the Web Container's vendor. Each vendor (WebSphere, JBoss, WebLogic etc) may provide their own means of setting a "default locale" for the container, so you'll have to consult the documentation of your Web container. I wouldn't be surprised if some Web Containers don't have a way to set a "default locale" to begin with.    
 
 p The second question - "I am wondering if there is anything like that" - is a bit unclear... if you meant what I think you meant, then the answer is above.    
 
 p The third question - "why is this missing from  code web.xml /code ?" - no particular reason that I know of, really. Remember, the format of  code web.xml /code  is determined by the Servlet / JSP specification so items included there are items that the spec "drivers" felt should belong there.    
 
 p Having said that, many Application Server (and Web Container) vendors provide their own "extensions" to the Servlet / JSP spec (for example, IBM WebSphere provides quite a few extensions). Typically, such "extra settings" are coded in additional XML files under WEB-INF code or /code META-INF` or a subdirectory thereof. It is possible that your Web Container provides means for the developer to specify a "default locale" at the Web Application level... but you'll have to consult the documentation for that (or provide information about your Web Container and we'll try to help you).

 p Originally the JSP code had a function in Javascript that would call a jsp from another server:    
 
 pre  code window.open("  %= otherServer % /ourreports/Company/fooreport.jsp?index"+index,"Foo",options); 
 /code   re  
 
 p where  code otherServer /code  was a local server (http://192.168.4.40:8080) 
This worked fine, and would pop out a new window with fooreport.jsp.     
 
 p The task now is to point to a jsp in the same server. 
So, I changed it to     
 
 pre  code window.open("/reports/Company/fooreport.jsp?index"+index,"Foo", options); 
 /code   re  
 
 p And I would get a  em download the file /em  popup instead of a page    
 
 p I also tried to do all of the following:    
 
 pre  code window.location = "/reports/Company/fooreport.jsp?index="+index; 
window.location.href = "/reports/Company/fooreport.jsp?index="+index; 
window.location = "http://localhost:9080/reports/Company/fooreport.jsp?index="+index; 
window.location.href = "http://localhost:9080/reports/Company/fooreport.jsp?index="+index; 
 /code   re  
 
 p And I still get the popup to download the fooreport.jsp to my computer.    
 
 p The jsp is well-formed, has the DOCTYPE, the  tags, the   %@ page declarations... It's essentially the same jsp that was being called before

 p How do I configure a  em JtaTransactionManager /em  object with  em allowCustomIsolationLevels /em  set to  em true /em  via Spring such that the Spring configuration can be used across multiple application servers?    
 
 p  strong Background: /strong     
 
 p I have an application that is currently running out of JBossAS and I'm trying to get it to run in WebSphere. The only issue I'm currently having is getting the correct JTA Transaction Manager injected with the proper settings.    
 
 p Here's the old setting

       roperty  
      property name="allowCustomIsolationLevels" value="true"   
  /bean  
 /code   re  
 
 p This worked since JBossAS has it's JTA Transaction Manager defined at JNDI location   em java:/TransactionManager /em . However, WebSphere does not have the same JNDI location.    
 
 p Spring 2.5.x provides a way to get the JTA Transaction Manager in a generalized way.    
 
 pre  code   tx:jta-transaction-manager   
 /code   re  
 
 p This gets the  em JtaTransactionManager /em  object and defines it as a bean with the id  em transactionManager /em .    
 
 p I looked in the  a href="http://www.springframework.org/schema/tx/spring-tx-2.5.xsd" rel="nofollow" Spring TX schema /a , but the only setting available is to set a specific isolation level, but not just to allow custom levels to be used (as defined elsewhere).  strong How do I set the  em allowCustomIsolationLevels /em  property using the  em tx:jta-transaction-manager /em  tag? /strong

<value columnNumber="1"> p There are several reasons.    
 
 p A Java EE app server is a transaction monitor for distributed components.  It provides a number of abstractions (e.g., naming, pooling, component lifecycle, persistence, messaging, etc.) to help accomplish this.    
 
 p Lots of these services are part of the Windows operating system.  Java EE needs the abstraction because it's independent of operating system.    
 
 p It should also be said that the full Java EE specification isn't necessary for developing web applications.  JDBC, the part of Java that deals with relational databases, is part of Java SE proper.  Java EE adds on servlets, which are HTTP listeners, and Java Server Pages, which is a markup language for generating servlets.  You can develop fully functional web applications using just these technologies and Java SE.  Tomcat and Jetty are two servlet/JSP engines that can stand in for full Java EE app servers.      
 
 p If you take note of the fact that .NET has HTTP listeners built into the System.Net module, you realize that it's as if .NET took a page from Java and folded the javax.servlet functionality into the framework.    
 
 p If you add Spring and a messaging functionality like ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ, you can write complete applications without having to resort to WebLogic, WebSphere, JBoss, or Glassfish.  You don't need EJBs or the full Java EE spec.

This behavior you're experiencing is actually by design.    
 
 p The reason for it is that the "Test Connection" button you see on the admin console, invokes the JDBC connection test from within the address-space of the  em Node Agent /em . There is no way for the J2C Alias information to propagate to the Node Agent without restarting it; some configuration objects take effect in WebSphere as soon as you save the configuration to the master repository, and some only take effect on a restart. J2C aliases take effect on restarts.    
 
 p In a Network Deployment topology, you may have 10 server instances all controlled by the same Node Agent. You may restart your server instances many times, but unless you restart the Node Agent itself, the "test connection" button will never work.    
 
 p It's a known WebSphere limitation... Which also exists on version 7.0, so don't be surprised when you test it during your next migration. :-)

By default WebSphere makes many standard Java classes available to all applications, these include things such as Web Service runtime and XML parsers and so on.    
 
 p So if you need to vary the JVM itself (say from 1.5 to 1.4) you're out of luck.    
 
 p However if you need to  override some of extension classes you can include the relevent JAR files in your application's EAR. Explore the "Parent First / Parent Last" setting on your application.    
 
 p IF the classes you want to use are at a higher version of Java (eg. Java 6) then again you're out of luck.    
 
 p If I understand correctly you have single cell, with some WAS 6.0 and some WAS 6.1? And you app is deployed to servers at both levels. (I view this is a pretty risky thing to do - so much complexity.)  You can create WebSphere Shared Libraries. Create two such libraries, one for the 1.4 JAR and one for the 1.5. You can assign Shared Libraries either to Applications or to Servers. In your case you should assign each library to the appropriate server.

<value columnNumber="1"> p This is a good question.  Some have incorrectly stated here that this is an apples to oranges comparison, i.e. Jboss is a container, and Spring is simply a framework, like Struts.  However, the reason this is a bit confusing is that both JBoss and Spring have expanded considerably from their original, simple origins, and are thus moving closer towards each other.  One easy way to understand JBoss is that the name was original "EJBoss", and it was intended on being an open-source J2EE application server, so it had the advantage over tomcat over serving as an EJB container, and thus could compete with WebSphere and other proprietary application servers.      
 
 p And Spring was an IoC framework (now referred to as "Dependency Injection"), essentially a factory for objects so that you can follow a more "loosely coupled" design.      
 
 p However, with their popularity, both products expanded. For example, JBoss now has it's own IoC container: 
 a href="http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t49723.html" rel="nofollow" JBoss IoC /a     
 
 p And while Spring can run perfectly well, coexisting (mostly) happily with JBoss, it doesn't need a full-blown EJB container, it can run easily in tomcat.  The whole design goal of Spring was based on the idea of lightweight design, and the use of POJOs, and the lack of requirement for a heavy-weight container, which was very contrary to EJBs, and thus would seem at odds with JBoss.    
 
 p  a href="http://forum.springsource.org/archive/index.php/t-12906.html" rel="nofollow" Rod Johnson /a has pointed out that there's no reason you can't run Spring in JBoss.  So what you have to decide is what parts of the two systems you want to use.  But according to this article, on  a href="http://www.javaworld.com/community/?q=node/3955" rel="nofollow" JBoss and Spring /a , which covers how well they adhere to standards, it does seem, depending on which technology you select, you are picking a side, as this seems to be a pretty contentious battle, and one more indication that the Java world is somewhat divided within itself.

 p  strong If you were to use configuration files /strong , placing configuration files inside the EAR (through exploding / re-packaging) has the drawback of having your EAR files non-portable between different environments (for example, QA environments vs. Production environments). Over time, this increases overhead and there's always the odd chance of confusion between environments.    
 
 p Alternatively, you could place these files in a separate directory and add that directory to your server's classpath. This is done differently in each application server; in WebSphere, this is done using the "shared libraries" facility.    
 
 p An approach that worked for us better, over the long run, is to use what J2EE technology actually designated to use for such tasks - using  code resource environment entries /code , accessible via standard JNDI mechanism under the  code java:comp/env /code  namespace.

 p There isn't a good answer to this question.  There certainly isn't enough critical mass to say there's a current most-popular RT JVM.    
 
 p US Defense systems I'm aware of use  s JavaRTS,  /s IBM's WebSphere RT, and PERC.  Aviation platforms use aicas JamaicaVM.  Most of those folks haven't been too concerned about licensing costs, to date.  They are concerned by much higher program risks.  I've worked with a number of these programs, and I find that the products are of high quality, and there is (at times extraordinary) support from the vendors.

 /ul  
 
 p Many of the vendors have focused on specific clients or domains, and their designs and support infrastructure tend to fall in line with that.  If you have a specific application profile in mind, maybe we can get you a better answer.    
 
 p The high licensing costs you cite reflect the high expectations users of these products have, and the relatively low density of the demand.  The developer community (such as it is) is also more fragmentary because systems with real-time or safety-critical constraints are typically of greater sensitivity (defense, aviation, SCADA) or protected proprietary value (automotive) or both.  One excellent forum for real-time Java theory and practice is the annual  a href="http://d3s.mff.cuni.cz/conferences/jtres2010/" rel="nofollow" JTRES conference /a , which is a close-knit group of academics and technically-savvy vendors.

Basically we have several war files that need to use Spring 3. We have put the spring jars in the JBoss lib, so that we don't have to have spring jars inside each and every war file. However, one of the web apps needs to use Spring 2 (not our code). What I want to have happen is that specific war file will have the Spring 2 jars in its web-inf/lib folder, and use those Spring jars. All the other web apps will use the Spring 3 jars in the JBoss lib folder.     
 
 p However, I am at a loss as to how to do this. I believe I should just have to put an xml file in the one war that needs to not read the jboss spring jars, but I can't quite get it right. I can't tell if I should be setting an isolation level for that war or what.

 li  p The configuration for the security context exists in the web.xml.  It must be present the installed war at application install time.  We had the config commented out so developers wouldn't need to give credentials when debugging and I was trying to uncomment after deploying the war.    /li  
 li  p You must map roles to your security realm at install time.  We have a script that deploys the applications and without modification, the roles were not mapped and the ability to map roles after install was not available.  Even installing from the ibm console site, you have to select detailed install and map groups at install time or the link to map is not available.    /li

 p Once I got the security installed and the redirect to the login page working, we had one other issue.  I'm not sure if this is an issue with our JSF code or not, but I could not redirect to a page that used JSF within WebSphere (works fine with Tomcat).  Our solution was to just use a jsp page for the authentication page.

 p The spec DOES NOT define or mandate how the class loaders should work within an EAR. It however defines thatÂ     
 
 ol  
 li there SHOULD be per thread context class loader for runtime loading of classes /li  
 li there MIGHT be a hierarchical class loading mechanism for resolving classes (app server vendors are free to implement whichever way they choose to) /li  
 li the top level class loader (WAR/EAR) MAY delegate to the low level class loaders (like Bootstrap, extension etc). This is in compliance with J2SE class loader delegation model (PARENT_FIRST in WAS) /li  
 /ol  
 
 p  strong WAR /strong     
 
 p Servlet specification defines and mandates the support of a PARENT_LAST (i.e. WAR/web-inf/classes and WAR/web-inf/lib take precedence over the libraries that come with the app server) class loading model. But this is just for WAR modules. The Servlet spec diverges from the standard J2SE delegation model of PARENT_FIRST in this case.

 p I have a very hard time interpreting the output. prstat seems to tell me that a fair amount of Java processing is going on, together with some Oracle stuff, just as I would expect in normal situation. prtstat -m shows a machine totally dominated by Oracle, consuming huge amounts of system time, and the overall CPU being heavily overloaded (large numbers in LAT).    
 
 p I'm inclined to believe the output of prstat -m, because that matches much mor closely to what the system felt like during this time. Totally sluggish, almost no more user request processing going on from WebSphere, etc. But why would prstat show so heavily differing numbers?    
 
 p Any explanation of this would be welcome!

I think the most common languages right now for universities to teach are Java and C++ as both offer good, cross-platform introductions into object-oriented concepts such as polymorphism and aggregation.    
 
 p If you are attending a technical college or community college for an associates degree, those are normally more applied and teach "how to program a website with PHP" or similar.  In that case, you may focus on the fundamentals of the class such as how do web application work, learn about compilers and how they work, etc.  Things they won't teach you but are valuable to know in the real world.    
 
 p If you want to parlay this knowledge into a job writing web applications, you must consider where you may work.  Different industries have accepted different languages.  Many young businesses and industries accept newer languages such as PHP, Ruby, etc.  Some shops are purely Windows (there are a lot) and do much of their web apps in .NET.  Then there are still a number of middleware-based solutions such as WebSphere, WebLogic, JBoss, etc.  There are also some in-between things that are still web focused such as PeopleTools programming.  You may also consider learning about web application scaling.    
 
 p If I were you, I would focus on a primary skill you already posess, and nurture that so that you become highly skilled.  You can't master everything, but being an expert in something makes you desirable.    
 
 p Hope this helps.

<value columnNumber="1"> p Thanks for bringing attention to the fact it was not on the wikipedia list of continuous integration applications. I have now added it. Build Forge has been a leader in providing continuous integration capabilities by use of it's SCM adapters for many, many years. Build Forge has a strength in supporting many platforms through its use of agents. These agents can run on Windows, Linux, AIX, Solaris, System Z, and many more -- they even give you the source code for the agents for free so you can compile it on just about any platform. The interface allows you to easily automate tasks that run sequentially or in parallel on one or multiple boxes. Selectors allow you to select a specific build server by host name or by criteria such as "any windows machine with 2gb of ram" from a pool of available agents. The entire process is fully auditable, utilizes role based permissions, and is stored in a central enterprise database such as DB2, Oracle, SQL Server, and others.     
 
 p One of the most compelling reasons to use Build Forge is it's Rational Automation Framework for WebSphere. It allows a full integration into WebSphere environments to automate deployments and configurations of WebSphere through out of the box libraries. The full installation, patching, deployment of apps, and configuration of WAS and Portal can be performed using these libraries. To find out more, it is best to contact your IBM Rational representative.

<value columnNumber="1"> p JMS doesn't specify the behavior you are looking for.  In fact, JMS specifically addresses problems due to network failure by noting that you may get the same message twice and calls this a "functionally duplicate" message since from the point of view of the JMS broker, it has only been delivered once.    
 
 p Since this is not part of JMS your answer lies in the different vendor implementations.  For example, WebSphere MQ has a feature called "Multi-Instance Queue Manager" as of v7.0.1.  A v7.0.1 client application will automatically retry the connection and even follow the QMgr from the primary to the secondary node in the event of a failure.  The application blocks while this occurs and is not aware of the failover.    
 
 p However, even with this behavior, your app still needs to code for the failure.  For example, if using the WMQ automatic reconnect (or any provider's reconnect for that matter) you probably want to tune the length of time the app might block waiting to recover the connection so that the user doesn't experience an indefinite hang.  When the call unblocks, the transaction is rolled back and any retry must occur in the code.  This is appropriate since the transaction is associated with a connection that is no longer valid.

<value columnNumber="1"> p You can, but also have the option to use separate certs and/or keystores if you want.  The keystore.conf file contains the details of the keystore and the label of the certificate that AMS will use for encrypting and signing messages.  This can point to the same certificate as used by the application for making connections to WebSphere MQ, the same certificate the app server uses for SSL connections or an entirely separate keystore dedicated to AMS.    
 
 p The key (excuse the pun) is to manage the keystores based on the security model required.  The app server's keystore probably has a number of external-facing certificates in its trust store.  For example, it might trust several commercial certificate authorities.  The AMS keystore must contain the certificates of anyone who will be signing or encrypting messages that your app will consume or receiving encrypted messages from your app.  Since these are usually internal-facing it might be worthwhile to use a separate keystore for AMS than is used for external-facing entities.  Otherwise the two different security models (internal-facing and external-facing) end up trusting each others participants.    
 
 p This is just one example and in general the idea is to construct the keystores based on the specific security model required and using a least-trust principle.  You have to balance the cost of maintaining separate keystores against the extra security of maintaining individual ones.

<value columnNumber="1"> p Ok. I've spent a long time researching this, reading redbooks and developerworks articles and pounding my head against my keyboard and I've finally gotten somewhere. Not all the way there, but almost. (Wish some IBM stuff was easier to find...but you work with what you are given. And in all fairness, with what I've read it makes sense and is pretty powerful.)    
 
 p Anyway, here is the trick to both the Rational and WebSphere tooling:  strong You have to create an empty Java Project first. /strong  This is one of the keys to making a portable web service client.    
 
 p So here it is so far:    
 
 ol  
 li Create an empty Java Project in your IDE. I prefer to use the Java EE perspective in either Rational Application Developer/Software Architect or in WebSphere Integration Developer. /li  
 li Import the WSDL(s) and schema(s) into another empty generic project in your IDE, NOT into the newly created Java Project. /li  
 li Right-click on the main WSDL and choose to generate a web service client. /li  
 li  strong Another key here /strong : Make sure that in the wizard that appears that you change the client project to be the Java Project you created in step one. By default the wizard will attempt to target a new or existing dynamic web project, which is NOT what you want. /li  
 li Make sure that you select JAX-WS as your implementation. Make sure you pick that you want the client to be "portable" and make sure that you tell the wizard to include the WSDL in the Java Project client. /li  
 li Pending you have everything in order (and your local server running), Rational/WebSphere tooling should now generate the JAX-WS web service client into the Java Project. /li  
 /ol  
 
 p Wonderful! Great! Now you have a Java Project (aka jar) that you can use to make it portable. But how do you make the IBM tooling happy and attach security policies to the client?    
 
 p Well first, i've learned that it really is best to attach the security policies in the administrative console of WebSphere Application Server/Enterprise Service Bus rocess Server. There are too many things to try to account for with security to try to manually code it all, even though IBM gives you the API's to do it. Trust me. It is easier to define the security on the server and then just assign it to the client.    
 
 p Anyway....in order to allow the client to be visible to the Admin console for attaching policy sets and client bindings for JAX-WS security, it has to be at the "web level" (for lack of a better term) in order for it to see the jar as a web client. This means that attaching the jar as a J2EE Utility Jar to the EAR project won't work. The EAR is NOT "web level" but is "App level". So to do this, you need to associate the Java Project with the EAR in the J2EE Module Dependencies screen, but NOT as a Utility Jar. Instead check the box that says "lib". This means it can be visible/mounted into the lib directory of a dynamic web project/war (which you also have to do). Amazingly, the admin console will now see your client jar as a true JAX-WS web service client! And now you can associate policy sets and client bindings to it in order to meet your security needs!    
 
 p This might appear weird at first but it does kind of make sense. After all you are dealing with a  em web /em  service and you are using  em web protocols /em , so in some ways it makes sense to place the client in the " em web level /em " of your application.    
 
 blockquote  
   p  strong EDIT: /strong  I've messed with the security policies and I've found that 
   a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/1009_chung/1009_chung.html" rel="nofollow" this developer works article /a  helped me the most. Pay special 
  attention to the  strong Listing 2 ClientTest.java /strong . Sadly, you have to 
  code all the security into your client to get it to work the cleanest. 
  And then here's another gotcha. IBM will allow you to create Username 
  Tokens from a client that runs outside of WebSphere, but they will NOT 
  allow you to create LTPA tokens outside of WebSphere. So to test those 
  kinds of tokens, you have to package and deploy your client locally to 
  test it all.

 p The requirement deals with this transaction that will need to time out in case WebSphere MQ does not delivery the response in a defined amount of time, than the web service should send a time-out signal to client and ignore this transaction.    
 
 p The sketch of the problem follows.     
 
 p I need to block the request on the web service until the response arrives or time-out.    
 
 p Than I am looking for some open library to help me on this task.  
Or the only solution is blocking a thread and keep pooling for the response? 
Maybe I could implement some block with a listener to be notified when the response arrives?     
 
 p A bit of discussion would be very helpful for me now to try to clear my ideas on this. 
Any suggestions?    
 
 p I have a sketch that I hope will help clearing the picture ;)

 p With WMQ the limiting factors are the transaction log and the life of the application.  If the application dies with a transaction outstanding, it is rolled back.  Other than that, the transaction lives in the logs until log space is exhausted, at which time the transaction is rolled back and the application gets a reason code to indicate the nature of the error.  If there are no other applications writing to the transaction log, the transaction can live indefinitely.  If the QMgr is busy, uncommitted transactions might last only a few seconds depending on log extents and size.

<value columnNumber="1"> p Having a slick demo in your back pocket to show (snow) clients is kind of like 
selling sizzle not the steak. Demo applications may illustrate how skillfully your staff 
can knock off a relatively light-weight problem with a lot of flair. But COBOL is less about sizzle and 
more about the steak - a marketing nightmare if style is emphasized over content.    
 
 p Basically, a hot demo illustrates to clients that you have some imagination, know how  
to write code within a given framework that integrates various services. Undeniably these are all good selling points.    
 
 p But COBOL applications don't make for great demos. Most clients running large COBOL shops already know this. 
It is unlikely they would be impressed by a demo - unless it addressed some specific point of interest 
to them. From my 20+ years experience as a contract COBOL  
programmer, I can say my clients are mostly interested in a solid resume backed up with solid references that illustrate a 
depth of experience in specific application domains (eg. accounting, human resources, inventory management, 
and the like).    
 
 p A solid company portfolio is probably more important than a demo. A few things you might want to outline are:    
 
 ul  
 li Type of businesses that you have supplied resources to (banking, finance, government, retail). /li  
 li Range of technologies, middleware and frameworks employed on given projects (eg. CICS, MQ-Series, DB/2,  
WebSphere, FTP, XML, RD/z, SAP, SAS etc.) /li  
 li Nature of skills provided to past clients (eg. programmers, technical analysts, business analysts, DBA,  
capacity planning, security analysts, data modeling, architect, project managers etc.)  /li  
 li Other than "putting bums in seats", point to any added value your company brought to these projects (eg. 
found a no-cost optimization that reduced a clients batch schedule by 2 hours). /li  
 li Put together a project case history to show how your company was able to do something special 
and different for a client. /li  
 li Point to any technologies, frameworks or application domains where you feel your company has some 
sort of competitive advantage over the "other guys". /li  
 /ul  
 
 p Try to address questions your prospective clients may have about you. 
Big COBOL shops have their own way of doing things. They often use a similar set of tools, but they 
all seem to have their own peculiar way of integrating them. They don't want some contractor coming in to 
rock their boat. But you can impress them by showing that your "guys" bring clear 
thinking, solid skills and a strong work ethic into the projects they have participated in.    
 
 p Above all, make the most of what you have accomplished but never over state or fluff up your  
abilities beyond the absolute truth. If a client ever catches a whiff of BS from anything 
you present, they will be out the door before you can blink.

 li The properties names and types (if SetBooleanProperty(Name) then GetBooleanProperty(Name))    
 
 p It make no sense to me. Since If i'm not familiar with the message structure should I explore all options until I retrieve the data in it?

 p Your question references JMS as an example.  Please be aware that you have the option of using IBM XMS - Extensible Message Service Client for .Net.  XMS implements the JMS API over .Net with WMQ, WMB or WAS as the transport so you can use JMS code with very little modification.  The  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.xms.doc/index.html" rel="nofollow" Message Service Client for .Net 2.0.0 /a  manual  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.xms.doc/concepts/xms_cwhatxms_net.html" rel="nofollow" describes the offering /a :

 p  strong Message Service Client for .NET /strong  br  
Message Service Client for .NET provides an application programming Interface (API) called XMS that has the same set of interfaces as the Java Message Service (JMS) API. Message Service Client for .NET contains a fully managed implementation of XMS, which can be used by any .NET compliant language. 
XMS supports:    
 
 ul  
 li point-to-point style messaging /li  
 li publish/subscribe style messaging /li  
 li Synchronous message delivery /li  
 li Asynchronous message delivery /li  
 /ul  
 
 p An XMS application can exchange messages with the following types of application:    
 
 ul  
 li An XMS application /li  
 li A WebSphere MQ JMS application /li  
 li A native WebSphere MQ application /li  
 li A JMS application that is using the WebSphere default messaging provider /li  
 /ul  
 
 p An XMS application can connect to, and use the resources of, any of the following messaging servers:    
 
 ul  
 li A WebSphere MQ queue manager - The application can connect in either bindings or client mode. /li  
 li A WebSphere service integration bus - The application can use a direct TCP/IP connection, or it can use HTTP over TCP/IP. /li  
 li A broker of WebSphere Event Broker or WebSphere Message Broker - Messages are transported between the application and the broker using WebSphere MQ Real-Time Transport and, depending on the configuration, messages can be delivered to the application using WebSphere MQ Multicast Transport. /li  
 /ul  
 
 p By connecting to a WebSphere MQ queue manager, an XMS application can use WebSphere MQ Enterprise Transport to communicate with a broker of WebSphere Event Broker or WebSphere Message Broker. Alternatively, an XMS application can use a WebSphere MQ Publish/Subscribe broker.    
 
 hr  
 
 p If you wish to explore further, the sample XMS code resides in subdirectories below the native .Net samples referred to earlier.  The samples are described in the  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.xms.doc/tasks/xms_tuse.html" rel="nofollow" Using the XMS Sample Applications /a  section of the manual.    
 
 p The .Net support is integrated into WMQ as of v7.  If you are lacking the samples then your WMQ client installation is back-level or incompletely installed.  The latest v7.0 WMQ Client for Windows is downloadable as  a href="http://bit.ly/SupportPacMQC7" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MQC7 /a .

So  strong www.main.com/ /strong  is serviced by the  strong Main /strong  application while  strong www.dynamic.com/ /strong  is serviced by the  strong Dynamic /strong  application.

1) Some how making this change using the admin console of WebSphere so that even if the xml file is regenerated, it would have the relevant routing rules automatically. br  
2) Writing a wsadmin JACL/Jython script that could be run each time after the plugin file is regenerated. This script should be able to update the above routing rules in the configuration. I have searched quite a lot for this approach but haven't found an encouraging reply to this approach.

<value columnNumber="1"> p  strong Pub/Sub /strong  br  
Prior to v7 of WMQ, Pub/Sub was available either as a separate component of WMQ or as part of the functionality of WebSphere Message Broker.  Now in v7 pub/sub is integral to WMQ and allows topic-level security.  There is a certain amount of pub/sub adoption that is occurring just because it is now baked into WMQ as native functionality.    
 
 p Another factor influencing uptake on WMQ pub/sub is that more people are being exposed to it through WMQ File Transfer Edition.  WMQ FTE makes status of file transfers available as publications and many people with this product are writing applications that monitor these topics to provide a variety of custom functionality.  Once they start using pub/sub, many of these shops begin to see other uses for it.    
 
 p Pub/Sub also solves some common problems with messaging such as an application that currently writes to a queue and a new requirement comes up to get a copy of that message to another consumer.  Prior to v7, switching an app from writing to a queue to writing to a topic was somewhat invasive and required configuration changes for JMS apps or code changes for other types of code.  The simplest way to address the problem was to intercept the message with an application or exit that wrote copies to two or more queues.  As of v7 an application that was written for queues can be provided with an alias over a topic.  The producer still thinks it is writing to a queue but WMQ is publishing the messages to a topic instead.  Consumers can then either subscribe directly or, in the case of legacy code that requires a queue, an administrative subscription can cause the messages on the topic to be delivered to a queue.  I am seeing a lot of uptake on pub/sub to address these kinds of requirement.    
 
 p There are also the cases where pub/sub is the appropriate solution and it is used for that reason alone.  In the past the requirement for separate components, administrative skill or a WMB license were barriers to adoption that caused a certain portion of pub/sub apps to be reworked as point-to-point.  With pub/sub built into WMQ, these barriers are eliminated or at least significantly reduced which leads to more uptake simply because it is the right architecture for the problem at hand.    
 
 p In general, I would say that WMQ pub/sub has gone mainstream with v7.  Since v6 end-of-life has been announced for September 2011, there will be a mass migration to v7 this year and subsequently even more adoption of pub/sub as a result.      
 
 p  strong SSL/TLS /strong  br  
As for SSL, WMQ security is approaching mainstream.  I wouldn't say SSL is the norm - just yet - but over the last two or three years it is in enough demand that my  a href="https://t-rob.net/links/" rel="nofollow" WMQ Hands-On Security Lab /a  sessions at the IMPACT and European WebSphere Technical conferences have had overflow attendance.  I  a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/1011_mismes/1011_mismes.html" rel="nofollow" recently wrote /a ...    
 
 blockquote  
   p The term "trusted internal network" 
  was coined to differentiate that part 
  of the network that was internal from 
  destinations outside the firewall. But 
  the term "trusted" as used in this 
  context is relative. It was not 
  supposed to indicate that the internal 
  network was trusted implicitly, only 
  that it was more trusted than things 
  outside the firewall. Unfortunately, 
  the term is sometimes interpreted 
  quite literally. I have had clients 
  quite earnestly tell me by definition 
  we trust everything on the "trusted 
  internal network", that's why we call 
  it that. Of course, this overstates 
  the case, because even the staunchest 
  believers in trusting the internal 
  network still enforce password-based 
  login to servers, databases, and 
  applications. So the internal network 
  is trusted, but only up to a point, 
  and even on the internal network 
  authentication and authorization are 
  essential.    
 /blockquote  
 
 p Although SSL (TLS, actually) channels encrypt, they also authenticate.  As more people realize that they need to authenticate WMQ connections on the "trusted" internal network, SSL has been a common method of achieving that.  Of course, there is also a growing requirement for privacy (encryption) and integrity services on the WMQ channels for both internal and external connections and this is driving adoption of WMQ SSL channels as well.    
 
 p Now that SSL is more common, there are a number of secondary challenges that pop up when people do not fully understand WMQ security.  The fact that these are now common topics on the  a href="https://listserv.meduniwien.ac.at/archives/mqser-l.html" rel="nofollow" WMQ listserve /a  and on  a href="http://mqseries.net" rel="nofollow" MQSeries.net /a  attests to the level of SSL adoption.  Some of these secondary issues are the inclusion of unused Certificate Authority root certs in the QMgr's keystore, or lack of QMgr channel settings like SSLPEER (which filters connections by distinguished name) or MCAUSER (which maps authorizations to a specific user account).  Frequently people enable SSL but overlook one or more of these other settings and do not achieve the level of security they had intended.  Since you must have enabled SSL for these things to present an issue, it is as a friend of mine says "a luxury problem."  It is much better to be challenged by SSLPEER settings than not to have applied SSL at all.    
 
 p  strong In summary... /strong  br  
So I suppose the short answer to both of these questions is that use of pub/sub and SSL in WMQ is quite common.  Both are on a sharp upward trend right now and if I were writing new applications I would definitely use SSL and would not hesitate to use WMQ pub/sub where called for.

 p In addition to servlets, JSPs, and JDBC, the full Java EE stack includes EJBs (distributed, transactional, life cycle managed components), JPA for persistence, JMS for messaging, JNDI for naming and directory services, etc.  If you need those items, by all means use Java EE and a full-fledged app server.    
 
 p The app server specification is the direction Sun took because they wanted to create a market in which there were several competitors, including themselves.  They succeeded quite nicely: we now have WebLogic, WebSphere, JBOSS, Glassfish, OpenEJB, Geronimo, and other app servers available.      
 
 p But it's not 100% necessary.  Microsoft's .NET, for example, doesn't have anything other than IIS web server and the underlying operating system.  They assume that you're running on Windows and .NET, so they don't try to abstract the same things that Java EE does.

In most of the cases for our WebSphere applications we have fronted our RPG/Synon programs with CL's and used the PCML to interface with them. We also have not normally worked with structs as inputoutput.    
 
 p This time one of our RPG developers created the program in RPG IV (not Synon) and gave us the PCML to interface with this program. We have three inputoutput parms as regular Strings. Not a big deal. We've done that before. Now the fourth parm as you can see is a struct of count 100 and it is inputoutput.

I've even used  code com.ibm.as400.data.PcmlMessageLog.setTraceEnabled(true); /code  to try to see the parms and that is what puzzles me. We look like there is no issue, but we aren't getting what we are expecting.

<value columnNumber="1"> p Yes, you are absolutely correct that if the message is structured data such as a fixed-length record format, you must know in advance the format of the message in order to parse it.  On the other hand, if the message payload is tagged data structure (such as valid XML) then you would use normal parsing to access it.  For example, you might use XPath to access an XML payload without first knowing the exact structure.      
 
 p The methods that you mention (WriteInt, ReadInt, etc.) would ordinarily be used to extract data from a known format and advance the buffer pointer to the next field.  However, there are also methods to read and write UTF strings.  If for some reason your application must process a variety of message types, then you can inquire on the message format and message type by querying the message descriptor.  The method for doing this is documented in  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.csqzal.doc/fg20120_.htm" rel="nofollow" Message descriptor fields as properties /a .  In this way you can distinguish between different types and formats of message and parse them appropriately.    
 
 p Note that the docs I have linked above are to the v7 .Net classes.  Since v6 end-of-life is September 2011, it is hoped that new development is all with the v7 classes, and preferably connecting to a v7 QMgr.    
 
 p  strong Edit - Response to comments /strong       
 
 p Example of checking the message format: br  
As per the page linked above, check the C header file cmqc.h for the fields in the MQMD.  This will tell you the field name as well as the field type.  In a default Windows installation, this file lives at  
 code C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere MQ\tools\c\include\cmqc.h /code       
 
 p So for example,  code message.getStringProperty('Root.MQMD.Format') /code  returns the message format.  Near the top of cmqc.h you will find a list of macros named MQFMT_ with the possible values for the MQMD Format field.  As of v7.01 they look like this:

Your results will vary because your messages will be more (or less) complex, your network will be more (or less) constrained, and your app code will be more (or less) CPU-intensive.

 p What LDAP server are you connecting too?  Does it have any logging? Can you get an error message from the LDAP server admins?  (I.e. If they see a bad bind DN, bad password error etc, then you have a much easier troubleshooting job to do).    
 
 p I am sure you have the right IP.  Now what port should you be connecting too?  Clear text is 389, LDAP over SSL is 636, but they might have changed those values for some reason.    
 
 p Does your LDAP server allow clear text connections at all?     
 
 p Do you have SSL configured correctly?  Generally this means that whatever system you are using, its trusted root keystore should include the public key of the CA that signed the server cert used by the LDAP server.  (I.e. Versign, Thwate)  Possibly it is using a self signed certificate, in which case you should get an export of the CA that minted its public key to import into your keystore.    
 
 p Webshpere is Java based, so I imagine it is using the the Java Keystore facility.  Use the keytool executable in the Java bin directory to add the trusted root to the keystore WebSphere is using.  (That detail I leave to you).

<value columnNumber="1"> p JSPX is perfectly suitable for producing both HTML and XHTML.    
 
 p It boils down to understanding the XML nature of this language.  strong JSPX is XML while HTML is not. /strong  One of the implications is that JSPX parser "minimizes" empty tags because XML does not differentiate between self-closing tags and empty tags. This causes the  code   script...  /code  and  code   div   /div  /code  tags problems. However, it's worth to note that while JSPX files must be valid XML,  strong the output they produce does not /strong . Thus it's perfectly correct to have a JSPX file producing HTML (not just XHTML). In fact, you could use JSPX to produce any textual output such as CSV, CSS or JS although it would be rather inconvenient.    
 
 p Taking account of the above, the cleanest solution seems to be creating a custom taglib with tags such as htmlScript, htmlDiv, etc. These tags could be used like this:    
 
 pre  code   html:div styleClass="foo" selfClosing="false" ${message}  html:div  
 /code   re  
 
 p Its HTML output would contain the closing tag, regardless of the content:    
 
 pre  code   div style="foo"   /div  
  div style="foo" Hello  /div  
 /code   re  
 
 p A taglib like this would let you build HTML pages with JSPX without using rather ugly workarounds.    
 
 p Building HTML pages seems to be one of the most common application of JSPX. It's somewhat surprising that there's no standard HTML library. JSF has one but if you use clean JSP it won't help you. There might be a third-party library filling this gap but I couldn't find one.    
 
 p If you don't feel like coding your own taglib, an alternative approach is to use CDATA:    
 
 pre  code   ![CDATA[  script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jquery-1.4.4.min.js" ]]

 p Other proposals in the related questions were to put a comment or empty  code   jsp:text  /code  inside  code   script  /code  which gives the same result:

 pre  code   script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jquery-1.4.4.min.js"   jsp:text   /jsp:text   /script  
 /code   re  
 
 p CDATA also comes in handy in a few other cases. One of them is printing the HTML5 doctype ( code   !DOCTYPE html  /code ). JSPX won't let you put DOCTYPE declaration inside your document because it's not a valid XML. JSPX also deifnes the jsp:output tag but it prints the SYSTEM attribute even when it's empty. A workaround is to wrap the DOCTYPE in CDATA at the beginning of a page:    
 
 pre  code   ![CDATA[  !DOCTYPE html ]]  
 /code   re  
 
 p CDATA can also be used to encapsulate inline JavaScript. While this produces parsing error because of the "  " sign:    
 
 pre  code   script type="text/javascript"  
    var x = 7    5; 
  /script  
 /code   re  
 
 p this will work fine:        
 
 pre  code   script type="text/javascript"  
      ![CDATA[ 
    var x = 7    5; 
    ]]  
  /script  
 /code   re  
 
 p Note that CDATA in JSPX outputs everything as-is but still evaluates EL expressions. Thus the following:    
 
 pre  code   ![CDATA[ 
  jsp:expression "asd " + "def"  /jsp:expression  
${1 + 2} 
]]  
 /code   re  
 
 p produces:    
 
 pre  code   jsp:expression "asd " + "def"  /jsp:expression  
3 
 /code   re  
 
 p Hope this helps :)

 ol  
 li  p Must all Java EE architectures involve an application server, such as JBoss or GlassFish, at some point? Essentially, is the concept of the application server fundamental to Java EE, and why/why not?    /li  
 li  p Beyond application servers, are there any other major components that a Java EE architecture depends on? If so, what are they and how do they "snap into" the architecture and relate to the application server?    /li  
 li  p I'm really choking on the concept of EJBs. From  em everything /em  I've been able to find on them, I can't tell if EJB is a  em specification /em  for developers to use (whereby complying with the EJB spec produces a unit of code that can be called a "bean"), or if its like any other Java library, like  strong JDBC /strong  or  strong JMS /strong . p  
(a) In the King's English, without using advanced, already-in-the-know concepts or marketing buzzwords, what is EJB? Can you provide a few quick  ;amp; dirty examples of (an) EJB? p  
(b) How does EJB interface/interact with an application server? p  
(c) What is an EJB "container", and what does it do?    /li

each type of these components, there are  em a lot /em  of both open- and closed-source varieties out there that 
you, the system engineer, must choose from. p  
Seeing that I am so confused on Java EE fundamental already, below is a list of some products I have heard 
about. I am simply asking for someone to help me categorize these products so I can see, in plain sight, 
what they are. For instance, if I list "GlassFish" and "JBoss", then they might appear in the category of 
"Application Servers." If I list "Tomcat" and "WebSphere", they might appear under "Servlet Engines", etc. p

 blockquote  
   p WebSphere MQ V7.0 introduces an 
  extension to the alias queue object 
  that allows it to be resolved to the 
  new topic object. This is useful for 
  migrating point-to-point messaging 
  applications to the Publish/Subscribe 
  model. A traditional point-to-point 
  application that puts messages into 
  WebSphere MQ can operate as a 
  publisher without any code changes by 
  utilizing an alias queue that resolves 
  to a topic object. This is implemented 
  administratively by defining a topic 
  object that maps to an appropriate 
  topic string on which the messages are 
  to be published. The original local 
  queue is deleted and replaced by an 
  alias queue of the same name that 
  resolves to the topic object. Also 
  note that a point-to-point application 
  that gets messages from WebSphere MQ 
  can operate as a subscriber without 
  any code changes by defining an 
  administrative subscription to a 
  topic.

 p WepSphere portal also have much better support for SSO (Single Sign On) and the security is better (Since you are a bank)

<value columnNumber="1"> p WebSphere MQ libraries are available with the Server or Client install.  C developers normally get around this sort of issue by actually installing the WMQ software.  Even assuming you manage to get the right WMQ libraries uncompressed, you will have a terrible time compiling if they are not installed to the expected locations.  For example, the WMQ message catalog is installed into the NLS directories and is referenced during compiles.  You might be able to resolve all the dependencies with compiler options pointing to each library but it would be a lot faster and easier to just install the software.    
 
 p If all you need is the client libraries these are freely downloadable as  a href="http://bit.ly/SupportPacMQC7" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MQC7 /a , although registration is required.  If you need the server libraries, you would need to have purchased WMQ Server or  a href="https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web reLogin.do?pkgid= ;amp;S_SRCID=ESD-WSMQ-EVAL ;amp;source=ESD-WSMQ-EVAL ;amp;S_TACT=104CBW71 ;amp;S_CMP=web_ibm_ws_appint_ct_wmq-ov ;amp;S_PKG=CR9H9ML ;amp;s= ;amp;id=2009-08-28+03%3A34%3A46.648052R ;amp;fam= ;amp;cat= ;amp;l=English+International ;amp;m=download ;amp;ibm-continue=Continue" rel="nofollow" downloaded the trial /a .  The primary difference is that the server libraries can connect to a local QMgr using shared memory and the client libraries always connect over the network.  If you need XA transactionality then you need the server licenses, regardless of how you connect.  The XA functionality is part of the WMQ server distribution and incurs a license obligation on each node where it is used.    
 
 p Once installed you should be able to compile programs, assuming you have all the prereq libraries such as the right libstdc++.  These requirements are listed per-platform at the  a href="https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171 ;amp;uid=swg27006467" rel="nofollow" WMQ Detailed System Requirements /a  page.  Finally, there are detailed instructions as to how to build programs for WebSphere MQ on Linux in the Infocenter topic named, appropriately enough,  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.csqzal.doc/fg16390_.htm" rel="nofollow" Building your application on Linux /a .

<value columnNumber="1"> p It may be that the top-most queue that the application is opening for reading is defined locally.  However, the queue that WMQ is resolving to is not.  For example, if you define a local alias over a remote clustered queue, the resolved queue is non-local.  Another possible cause is that a queue you intend to open for output is actually being opened for input as well.  This is actually quite common.      
 
 p Finally, it is also somewhat common that the WMQ client is connected to a different queue manager than expected.  For example, the connection is to QMGRA and the queue object specifies a fully-qualified name like QUEUE@QMGRB.  Even though the queue lives on QMGRB and the JNDI object specifies that queue manager by name, the connection on QMGRA resolves it to a transmit queue and therefore sees it as non-local.    
 
 p One of the best ways to nail this kind of error down in Dev is to use  a href="http://bit.ly/SupportPacMA0W" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MA0W /a .  This SupportPac runs as an API exit or as a channel exit and lists in human-readable language all of the API calls and all of the options selected for the call.  This will unequivocally show exactly what object name was opened, what it resolved to and the options used.    
 
 p Alternatively, you can turn on trace using  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.amqzag.doc/fa16100_.htm" rel="nofollow" strmqtrc /a .  Don't forget to disable it with  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.amqzag.doc/fa15810_.htm" rel="nofollow" endmqtrc /a  when you are done!  These traces are enabled and disabled on the QMgr server and trace WMQ API calls.  There are equivalent traces to run on the client side but these may not show the level of detail that you require.    
 
 p Finally, it would be advisable to print any exceptions linked to the JMS exceptions.  The JMS Exception is a multi-level data structure where the linked exception holds provider-specific values.  For example, a JMS Security exception might be a WMQ authorization error.  But then again, it might be an error in the keystore or filesystem.  If the linked exception does not show a WMQ 2035 reason code, it's not a WMQ security error.  The Infocenter describes how to print the linked exception data in the section named  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.csqzaw.doc/jm35210_.htm" rel="nofollow" Exceptions in WebSphere MQ classes for JMS /a .    
 
 p Note that I've provided links to the v7.0 WMQ docs.  If you are coding in v6 these may not be completely accurate and you would want to look in the  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv6/v6r0/index.jsp" rel="nofollow" v6.0 Infocenter /a  instead.  Since v6.0 of WMQ is end-of-life as of September 2011 it is highly recommended to do all new development on v7.0.  If you need the v7.0 client it is downloadable as  a href="http://bit.ly/SupportPacMQC7" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MQC7 /a  and is backward compatible with v6.0 WMQ servers.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I have been using Spring Security 3.x for handling user authentication for my projects, and so far, it has worked flawlessly.    
 
 p I recently received the requirements for a new project. In this project, it requires 2 sets of user authentication: one to authenticate employees against LDAP, and another to authenticate customer against database. I'm a little stumped on how to configure that in Spring Security.    
 
 p My initial idea was to create a login screen that has the following fields:-    
 
 ul  
 li radio button field - for users to choose whether they are employees or customers. /li  
 li  code j_username /code  user field. /li  
 li  code j_password /code  password field. /li  
 /ul  
 
 p If the user selects "employee", then I want Spring Security to authenticate them against LDAP, otherwise the credential will be authenticated against database. However, the problem is the form will be submitted to  code /j_spring_security_check /code  and there's no way for me to send the radio button field to my implemented custom authentication provider. My initial thought is I probably need two form submission URLs rather than relying on the default  code /j_spring_security_check /code . Each URL will be handled by different authentication providers, but I'm not sure how to configure that in Spring Security.    
 
 p I know in Spring Security, I can configure fall back authentication, for example if LDAP authentication fails, then it will fall back to database authentication, but this is not what I'm shooting for in this new project.     
 
 p Can someone share how exactly I should configure this in Spring Security 3.x?    
 
 p Thank you.    
 
 hr  
 
 p  strong UPDATE - 01-28-2011 - @EasyAngel's technique /strong     
 
 p I'm trying to do the following:-    
 
 ul  
 li Employee form login submits to  code /j_spring_security_check_for_employee /code  /li  
 li Customer form login submits to  code /j_spring_security_check_for_customer /code  /li  
 /ul  
 
 p The reason I want 2 different form logins is to allow me to handle the authentication differently based on the user, instead of doing a fall-back authentication. It is possible that employee and customer have same user ID, in my case.    
 
 p I incorporated @EasyAngel's idea, but have to replace some deprecated classes. The problem I'm currently facing is neither filter processes URLS seem registered in Spring Security because I keep getting  code Error 404: SRVE0190E: File not found: /j_spring_security_check_for_employee /code . My gut feeling is the  code springSecurityFilterChain /code  bean is not wired properly, thus my custom filters are not used at all.    
 
 p By the way, I'm using WebSphere and I do have  code com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.invokefilterscompatibility=true /code  property set in the server. I'm able to hit the default  code /j_spring_security_check /code  without problem.

 p Okay, I managed to get @Ritesh's approach to work very closely to what I wanted. I have the radiobutton that allows user to select whether they are customer or employee. It seems like this approach is working fairly well, with one problem...     
 
 ul

 li If employee logs in with wrong credential, they are not allowed in...  strong WORK AS EXPECTED /strong . /li  
 li If customer logs in with right credential, they are allowed in...  strong WORK AS EXPECTED /strong . /li  
 li  p If customer logs in with wrong credential, the authentication falls back to employee authentication...  strong DOESN'T WORK /strong . This is risky because if I select customer authentication, and punch it the employee credential, it will allow the user in too and this is not what I want.

 p Okay, I think I have solved the problem here. Instead of having  code EmployeeCustomAuthenticationProvider /code  to rely on the default  code UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken /code , I created  code EmployeeUsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken /code  for it, just like the one I created  code CustomerUsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken /code  for  code CustomerCustomAuthenticationProvider /code . These providers will then override the  code supports() /code :-    
 
 p  strong CustomerCustomAuthenticationProvider class /strong     
 
 pre  code @Override 
public boolean supports(Class  ? extends Object  authentication) { 
    return (CustomerUsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken.class.isAssignableFrom(authentication)); 
} 
 /code   re  
 
 p  strong EmployeeCustomAuthenticationProvider class /strong     
 
 pre  code @Override 
public boolean supports(Class  ? extends Object  authentication) { 
    return (EmployeeUsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken.class.isAssignableFrom(authentication)); 
} 
 /code   re  
 
 p  strong MyAuthenticationFilter class /strong     
 
 pre  code public Authentication attemptAuthentication(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws AuthenticationException { 
 
    ... 
 
    UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken authRequest = null; 
 
    if ("customer".equals(request.getParameter("radioAuthenticationType"))) { 
        authRequest = new CustomerUsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(username, password); 
 
    } 
    else { 
        authRequest = new EmployeeUsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(username, password); 
    } 
 
    setDetails(request, authRequest); 
 
    return super.getAuthenticationManager().authenticate(authRequest); 
} 
 /code   re

<value columnNumber="1"> p With any asynchronous messaging you must deal with the "fast producer/slow consumer" problem.  There are a number of ways to deal with this.    
 
 ol  
 li Add consumers.  With WebSphere MQ you can trigger a queue based on depth.  Some shops use this to add new consumer instances as queue depth grows.  Then as queue depth begins to decline, the extra consumers die off.  In this way, consumers can be made to automatically scale to accommodate changing loads.  Other brokers generally have similar functionality. /li  
 li Make the queue and underlying file system really large.  This method attempts to absorb peaks in workload entirely in the queue.  This is after all what queuing was designed to do in the first place.  Problem is, it doesn't scale well and you must allocate disk that 99% of the time will be almost empty. /li  
 li Expire old messages.  If the messages have an expiry set then you can cause them to be cleaned up.  Some JMS brokers will do this automatically while on others you may need to browse the queue in order to cause the expired messages to be deleted.  Problem with this is that not all messages lose their business value and become eligible for expiry. Most fire-and-forget messages (audit logs, etc.) fall into this category. /li  
 li Throttle back the producer.  When the queue fills, nothing can put new messages to it.  In WebSphere MQ the producing application then receives a return code indicating that the queue is full.  If the application distinguishes between fatal and transient errors, it can stop and retry. /li  
 /ol  
 
 p The key to successfully implementing any of these is that your system be allowed to provide "soft" errors that the application will respond to.  For example, many shops will raise the MAXDEPTH parameter of a queue the first time they get a QFULL condition.  If the queue depth exceeds the size of the underlying file system the result is that instead of a "soft" error that impacts a single queue the file system fills and the entire node is affected.  You are MUCH better off tuning the system so that the queue hits MAXDEPTH well before the file system fills but then also instrumenting the app or other processes to react to the full queue in some way.    
 
 p But no matter what else you do, option #4 above is mandatory.  No matter how much disk you allocate or how many consumer instances you deploy or how quickly you expire messages there is always a possibility that your consumer(s) won't keep up with message production.  When this happens your producer app should throttle back, or raise an alarm and stop or do anything other than hang or die.  Asynchronous messaging is only asynchronous up to the point that you run out of space to queue messages.  After that your apps are synchronous and must gracefully handle that situation, even if that means to (gracefully) shut own.

 p If you put this at the top of your JSP pages:    
 
 pre  code   %@ page errorPage="errorpage.jsp"%  
 /code   re  
 
 p then if an error occurs on that JSP page the user will be redirected to  code errorpage.jsp /code . You can then put the following page directive in your error page JSP:    
 
 pre  code   %@ page isErrorPage="true" %  
 /code   re  
 
 p That makes an  code javax.servlet.jsp.ErrorData /code  object available to the error page code, which you could log along with an ID, date  ;amp; time.

<value columnNumber="1"> p Three key advantages:    
 
 ul  
 li A bus provides a way for end points to connect to each other without having to directly talk to each other.  It  em simplifies the communications /em  for the end points as they only have to conform to a standard communication interface, the bus. (This is with any technical bus, not just ESBs) /li  
 li An ESB provides a  em single place /em  to get some key end point metrics: frequency, availability, and performance. /li  
 li An ESB tends to provide more than one communication interface.  However, a developer only needs to choose the easiest one to get and receive the data from the bus. /li  
 /ul  
 
 p However, make sure those will provide  strong business value /strong  for your situation.  Having an ESB is adding yet another complexity to your enterprise.  Ideally you shouldn't choose this based on a few applications, but the entire organization.  There should be only  strong one /strong  production ESB cluster for the organization.    
 
 p Alternatives:    
 
 ul  
 li Just connect things to each other directly especially if the communication protocols are the same.  This is good for simple application clusters and does not require too much thinking.  However, as your number of applications grow, maintaining the interconnections becomes difficult. /li  
 li Another alternative is an MQ implementation.  This will provide you with a way of pushing data around without having complex interconnections, but then you are forced to use only one communication channel.  Fortunately for Java, they have the JMS standard. /li  
 /ul  
 
 p Practicality:    
 
 p I have stated the possible alternatives.  They may seem lousy at first, but it is not to say you cannot start that way.  I personally write things to talk to the remote directly without going through an ESB to make sure it works without worrying too much about integration issues.    
 
 p If you don't have an ESB, I suggest you try Mule for development and WebSphere ESB for test and production.  I tend to use two products that supposedly follow standards to make sure we keep the vendors honest and to make sure your developers are conforming to standards preventing inadvertent vendor lock-in.    
 
 p In the end, just answer the following question: is the time adding the bit of complexity to simplify other complexities your enterprise worth the cost in the long run?

<value columnNumber="1"> p The answer to the question depends on whether you want to put the resulting code into Production.  You can grab a few jar files and include them on the CLASSPATH and get it to work.  In fact with the repackaging done in v7, the number of jars has been reduced.  However, it is not supported by IBM without the full client install.    
 
 p Why is that?  The full install includes diagnostic facilities, supporting code, NLS support and the ability to collect all the Must Gather information to open a trouble ticket.  If all you grab is a few jar files, you do not get the additional functionality and therefore no vendor support if something goes wrong.    
 
 p The WMQ v7 client install provided as  a href="http://bit.ly/SupportPacMQC7" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MQC7 /a  which is a free download.      
 
 p The jar files and CLASSPATH settings for both base Java and JMS are provided in the  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.csqzaw.doc/uj10120_.htm" rel="nofollow" Using Java /a  manual.    
 
 p Use the v7 client, even on a v6 server.  It's backward compatible.  In v7.0 the Java/JMS has all been rewritten and you just need the jars listed in the manual.    
 
 p Also, someone mentioned the etclient jar.  That's the Extended Transactional Client and please be aware that it incurs the full license cost of a QMgr.  You only need it if you are doing 2-phase commit (XA with WMQ and another resource manager in the same unit of work) and not using WebSphere App Server or Message Broker.  For example, you want to do TPC using JBoss, MQ and a database, you need etclient jar file and pay for a full WMQ license.  If you are not doing XA transactions you don't need it.

<value columnNumber="1"> p What is the recommended architecture for accessing WebSphere MQ message queues across internet (i.e. 100+ ms latency) and over organizational boundaries?    
 
 p The two approaches that we are considering are to access the other organization's Queue Manager directly from our clients and the alternative is to have a Queue manager locally that would pump the messages from the remote queue and then local clients will access it. I think that both have merit but I am not sure of the trade-offs between the two architectures.    
 
 p The volume that we would have to handle is 600 per second with message size of about 50 bytes. The other org's queue manager is not changeable (and it is WebSphere MQ). The messages have to be processed in order. Perhaps they can be split between different queues and then each queue to be processed by separate client but in each queue the order is still very important. In general there would be one transaction processing client. There could be one additional business intelligence client that would process a copy of the message.    
 
 p Does anyone have any perf metrics of MQSeries to MQSeries queue manager throughput and a comparison of WebSphere MQ queue manager to client throughput?

<value columnNumber="1"> p The correct answer here is that the customers need to download the actual WMQ client and install it with your application and that your application should be distributed without the WMQ client jars.  This is true for a variety of reasons:    
 
 ul  
 li You are not authorized to redistribute the vendor's code.  When WMQ client or server code is bundled in an OEM license, it is the full install and not just a few jar files. /li  
 li One of the reasons for installing the full client is to get support.  The full client install is free and includes a number of diagnostic facilities.  The only reason not to require a full install is convenience and if you are charging money for the app any convenience is far outweighed by potential liability. /li  
 li Maintenance.  If the customer installs the WMQ client then they can apply periodic maintenance from IBM and know that it is a complete and intact distribution.  Unless your company is prepared to guarantee that the components they choose to redistribute are a valid installation, you are better off using the official install.  Given the nature of the question is asking this community what the valid non-vendor installation is, I don't see how your company can stand behind this configuration of IBM's code. /li  
 li Regulatory compliance.  If any of your customers are subject to PCI, SOX, HIPAA or government regulations, certification cannot be achieved under this configuration.  For example, to be PCI compliant the deployed application must have applied Fix Pack 7.0.1.3 quite some time ago.  Without the full install, it is impossible to apply the fix pack or prove to an auditor it has been installed based on the jars. /li  
 li Security.  If you are not using SSL or an exit than it is possible for your customers to impersonate one another or the WMQ administrative account.  In order to be using SSL you would have to have installed the IBM JCCE provider which comes in GSKit, which is part of the full client install and contains native compiled C code ot available in jar files.  Based on the description of the app, I'm guessing any of your customers can remotely, anonymously administer your QMgr and execute arbitrary OS code.  Not good. /li  
 /ul  
 
 p So the correct answer is for you and your clients to go download and install the full WMQ client ( a href="http://ibm.co/SupptPacMQC7" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MQC7 /a ) and configure the app to run on that.  Anything less places your clients and your company at risk.    
 
 p And if you have any doubt about the security exposures I mentioned, please refer to the IMPACT  em Hardening WebSphere MQ /em  presentation and the  em WebSphere MQ Hands-on Security Lab /em   a href="http://t-rob.net/links" rel="nofollow" posted here /a .

<value columnNumber="1"> p The Cache-Control general-header field is used to specify directives that MUST be obeyed by all caching mechanisms along the request/response chain. The directives specify behavior intended to prevent caches from adversely interfering with the request or response. These directives typically override the default caching algorithms. Cache directives are unidirectional in that the presence of a directive in a request does not imply that the same directive is to be given in the response.     
 
 p If the no-cache directive does specify one or more field-names, then a cache MAY use the response to satisfy a subsequent request, subject to any other restrictions on caching. However, the specified field-name(s) MUST NOT be sent in the response to a subsequent request without successful revalidation with the origin server. This allows an origin server to prevent the re-use of certain header fields in a response, while still allowing caching of the rest of the response.     
 
 p (Please see  a href="http://www.w3.org rotocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html" rel="nofollow" rfc2616 /a  at 14.9 and 14.9.1)    
 
 p What no-cache="set-cookie, set-cookie2" does is that is tells every upstream proxy servers not to cache and possibly re-send the cookies (ie. authentication related cookies) by mistake to other clients than intended. You are probably attempting to (reverse) proxy something from an application server, and you are not seeing the cookies in browser because your configuration forces or allows the front-end server to cache and re-serve the content itself. Browsers and proxies drop the cookie by request while doing that.    
 
 p What should be done is that the application server should respond with plain no-cache directive without any headers defined. It would be clear beacuse in sense the resource that gives 302  em is /em  meant private.     
 
 p Unfortunately IBM WebSphere is a large product family, and making such configurations is product dependent. If this header comes from the insides of an IBM product, you should probably open a PMR. You could also write a  a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/filters-137243.html" rel="nofollow" Server Filter /a  for manipulating the headers externally. If it's your application that is in question just remove printing of the headers (set-cookie and set-cookie2) from your code but leave the no-cache part.

 p Here's the situation:    
 
 p 1) IBM RAD has the ability to deploy a Portlet directly from within itself (RUN/DEBUG)    
 
 p In this case, I'm not using Maven generated WAR at all because IBM RAD seems to create the WAR themselves automagically and push it to IBM WebSphere Portal. Which isn't a big deal so far.    
 
 p 2) Maven dependencies are not copied to WebContent/WEB-INF/lib directory    
 
 p IBM has its own directory structure: WebContent/WEB-INF and WebContent/META-INF. If I updated pom.xml to include new dependencies, those JARS will not be copied to the WebContent/WEB-INF/lib directory hence when I wanted to RUN/DEBUG the portlet, those libraries will not be included.    
 
 p Question:    
 
 p Is there a way to copy the new JARs automatically to the WebContent/WEB-INF/lib folder as soon as I update the pom.xml? (if so, which lifecycle this should be in?)    
 
 p If there's no perfect solution for question #1, I don't mind if this step is included in the "mvn install" compile/goal.     
 
 p Prefer not to use ant-task but instead maven own copy utility if exist.     
 
 p If anyone has suggestions how to integrate Maven and IBM RAD for WebSphere Portlet development, feel free to add more answers.

 p Got a bit of a pickle for AJAX calls.  All of my AJAX calls are to URLs that are a part of my web.xml's security constraint that requires authentication.  Authentication is standard form based j_security so on every request to the secure rotected URL the container (WebSphere) will intercept that call and see if the authentication is good and if the authentication isn't good it will auto-redirect to the login page.  Pretty simple/standard and expected right I think.    
 
 p Take a look at the following code.  Regardless of the client's authentication status (authenticated, not authenticated, timed out) the GET call (or post, doesn't matter) to that url ALWAYS returns a 200.

WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition (WMQ FTE) is a Java application built on WebSphere MQ and which provides an enterprise file transfer platform.  The transfer occurs between two agents, one at the source and one at the destination.  In the lifecycle of the transfer there are four points at which external code can be called - before the transfer starts at both the source and the destination agents, and after the transfer completes at the source and destination agents.  The two methods by which external code may be called are exits and calls.    
 
 p  strong Exits /strong  br  
Exits are implemented as Java classes and are called from the agent code.  The scope of these is per-agent and once enabled, the exit is called for every transfer.  This makes them appropriate for enforcing global policies or providing a ubiquitous service such as virus scanning.    
 
 p  strong Calls /strong  br  
Calls are implemented as (mostly) separate tasks in the transfer lifecycle and may be either an Ant script or a command-line executable.  These are defined within the transfer job definition and the post-transfer calls will not fire if the transfer fails.  This makes them suitable for providing functionality that is specific to a transfer or that depends on the outcome of the transfer.  For example, a post-transfer destination call is a good place to perform decryption because this is something you would usually define for specific transfers and the decrypt step will not fire if the transfer fails.    
 
 p  strong Order of exits and calls /strong  br  
Exits and calls both fire before the transfer starts and after the transfer completes, at both the source and target agents.  But the documentation does not yet show the relationship between calls and exits.  By creating a set of calls and exits which update the same log file, it is possible to demonstrate the firing order.    
 
 p Below is the timeline of exit points and calls during a file transfer.  The names of the exits are as per the Java interface definition.  The names of the calls are as per the XML schema for transfer definitions.

method testA is defined with PROPAGATION_REQUIRED.

 p Then we execute testA method of this service.  
In logs we can see then for method testA new transaction is created, what is OK. 
But when testB method is executed from methodA,  
in logs we have information that actual transaction is being used  
instead of suspending actual and creating another one  
(like is defined in configuration).    
 
 p So is it normal behaviour in spring that  
when we execute service method in other method of the same service, 
spring omit transactional configuration for this method  
(like in example for method testB)  
and always use PROPAGATION_REQUIRED attribute?    
 
 p Additionally let's say when method testB is from other service  
and configuration for this method is the same (PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW) 
everything seems tobe fine (new transation is created, actual suspended).    
 
 p As transaction manager is used WebSphereTransactionManagerFactoryBean (spring 2.5).

The cookie is normally sent by the browser on each request when authentication has happended once, BUT it will only do so if it believes that the cookie is related to a given domain. So if the main part of your website were served from, say,    
 
 pre  code htpp://my.own.org.com/mysite

 p and the file upload were related to a subtly different host    
 
 pre  code http://my.other/filesite 
 /code   re  
 
 p Then the cookie would not be sent, and a challenge would result.    
 
 p My approach to diagnosing this would be get some kind of traffic sniffer. See exactly what is flowing and the addresses being used. I'm predicting that you will see the LTPA cookie in the usual case and not in the upload case. Then it's a matter of figuring out "why".

 p Finally, if the queue that you are accessing is a remote queue then it will resolve to a transmit queue.  The channel will always set a transmit queue to GET(INHIBITED) and acquire an exclusive lock on it.  This is consistent with WMQ functionality in that an application can only GET messages from a local queue.

 ol  
 li To base the page composition and layout on data retrieved dynamically, say from a database. For this you need to figure out what to stash in the database (say a list of widget names, their sizes and position, and perhaps their styles and configuration too.) and the how to render a page from that information. I don't know JQuery, but you may have to create a bit of code to do this, not really difficult, but some work.  /li  
 li How to select a particular instance from the database based on the user's id and the page they select. Typically the user asks for 
 a href="http://mysite.com/sport" rel="nofollow" http://mysite.com/sport /a  
and your app knows the user's id from authentication information established earlier in the session and passed around via cookies. In the case of JEE this is just available in the servlet API. /li

<value columnNumber="1"> p As you say, we use XML to pass data between applications, often those applications are written in different programming languages, and so XML gives us a common data format.    
 
 p When we get into the applciation code itself it's most convenient to work with the langauges natural constructs. For example:    
 
 pre  code   Order  
         Customer name="bill" phone="123-345456"      
       etc.        
  /Order  
 /code   re  
 
 p In some environments (for example in Enterprise Service Bus products) you actual work with the XML, defining transformations of the XML. So you could google for various ESB products and read about them.I work for IBM and Sos I'm familiar with   a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/wsesb/" rel="nofollow" WebSphere ESB /a  and quite interestingly there are hardware XML processing products, for example IBM's  a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/datapower/" rel="nofollow" DataPower /a , which can really speed up XML processing.    
 
 p But in usual programming languages it's very convenient to write your application code against programming constructs representing the data, so in Java we'd like an Order class, and a Customer class and so on.    
 
 p Then having converted the XML to objects we can just write natural code such as    
 
 pre  code  customer.getName() 
 /code   re  
 
 p So different programming environment will have different appraoches to dealing with these kind of conversions. In the Java world there have been several approaches to this mapping between XML and Java. These days JAX/B is increasingly used, I have a brief example in  a href="http://djna.wordpress.com/2010/08/02/flazr-and-redirection-with-a-smil/" rel="nofollow" this article /a  where you will see there is very little code to write to perform the conversion.

<value columnNumber="1"> p WebSphere MQ is a messaging engine that provides assured delivery of some message ayload.  MQ provides a Queue Manager: a server application that hosts Queues (to hold messahes) and Channels  ;amp; Listeners (to allow Queue Managers to communicate with each other).  MQ provides an API interface that implements JMS.  It also has a number of APIs native to MQ.  As of WebSphere MQ version 7.0.1 it also provides a publish-subscribe engine.  WebSphere MQ basically lets you put a message in one place and get that message somewhere else with the smallest chance of the message being lost.    
 
 p WebSphere Message Broker is a program that attempts to provide an any-transport-to-any-transport interface, and an any-language transformation engine.  In terms of transports, it provides MQ, JMS (most providers), MQ-FTE, local files, SMPT, FTP/SFTP, HTTP/HTTPS, TCP/TCPSSL, JDBC and probably some other entry hooks I have forgotten.  Once the message is in MEssage Broker, you can manipulate that message using ESQL (SQL-like language native to Message Broker), Java, PHP, XSTL.  It also contains functionality for message routing, collecting, aggregation, sequencing etc.  Message Broker basically allows you to move data from a number of formats (both physical and logical) and manipulate that data before putting it somewhere else, possibly in a different format.

Before I provide links to them, let me point out that WMQ v6 is end-of-life as of September this year (2011 as this is being written).  You would be MUCH better off going for the v7 certification.    
 
 p The two available certifications are  
 -  a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/certify/certs/15004004.shtml" rel="nofollow" IBM Certified System Administrator - WebSphere MQ V7.0 /a  
 -  a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/certify/certs/15003004.shtml" rel="nofollow" IBM Certified Solution Designer - WebSphere MQ V7.0 /a     
 
 p The System Administrator certificate is awarded by passing  a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/certify/tests/ovr374.shtml" rel="nofollow" Test 000-374: IBM WebSphere MQ V7.0, System Administration /a .  If you go to the linked page you will see a tab "Test Preparation".  If you go to that tab and scroll past the formal classroom and online training you will find an extensive section of links to self-study resources and specific chapters in the manuals.      
 
 p The Solution Designer certification is awarded after passing  a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/certify/tests/ovr376.shtml" rel="nofollow" Test 000-376: IBM WebSphere MQ V7.0, Solution Design /a .  The web page for this test has similar tabs and resources.    
 
 p On the pages for both tests, the Overview tab has an item called Sample/Assessment Test.  The sample tests costs $30 USD and it provides you with a breakdown by category of what information you are strong or weak on.  If you planned to spend about 100 hours studying for the test, that comes to about $0.30/hour to insure you are focusing on the right areas and so is a pretty good deal.    
 
 p Below are links to additional resources.

 p This may seem like a lot but when you get to the Infocenter you will see that this is less than 1/3 of the manuals available.    
 
 p Some of the functionality of WMQ is delivered as  a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171 ;amp;uid=swg27007197#1" rel="nofollow" SupportPacs /a .  You will need to know what these are and in particular the Cat 3 ones.  SupportPacs are organized into several categories where the most common ones are Cat 2 which are provided as-is and Cat 3 which are fully supported product extensions.  Notable Cat 3 SupportPacs include  a href="http://bit.ly/SupportPacMQC7" rel="nofollow" MQC7 WebSphere MQ Client /a ,  a href="http://bitly/SupportPacMS0T" rel="nofollow" MS0T Stand-Alone WMQ Explorer /a  (the official WMQ Explorer install as of v7) and  a href="http://bit.ly/SupportPacMS81" rel="nofollow" MS81 WMQ Internet Pass-Thru /a  (also known as MQIPT).    
 
 p You will need to know a little about the platforms that WMQ runs on.  My suggestion would be to look over the  a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171 ;amp;uid=swg27006467" rel="nofollow" Detailed System Requirements /a  page.    
 
 p You will need to know how fixes and maintenance are delivered and applied.  Check out the  a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171 ;amp;uid=swg27006037" rel="nofollow" Recommended Fixes /a  page.    
 
 p Most of the practical advice you will find is in articles and the newer Redbooks.  If you will forgive a little self-promotion, the  a href="http://bit.ly/MisMesIDX" rel="nofollow" Mission:Messaging /a  column on developerWorks is my attempt to provide practical advice to supplement the official manuals.  The articles on "Top 10 SupportPacs", "Understanding the setmqaut command", "Cluster Design" and "Mice and Elephants" are good general-purpose WMQ solution design articles.    
 
 p Nothing is more helpful than simply playing with WMQ in your own sandbox environment.  From the  a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/" rel="nofollow" WMQ Home Page /a  you will find a link to the trial download for v7.0.  Get it.  Play with it.  Break it.  Uninstall and reinstall it.  Use the Q program ( a href="http://bit.ly/SupportPacMA01" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MA01 /a ) to put/get or publish and subscribe to messages.  Build a cluster in a VM.  Play with authorizations.    
 
 p If you want to learn about WMQ security, download the WebSphere MQ Security Lab and the Hardening WebSphere MQ Security presentation from the IMPACT conference.  Although conference materials are normally only available to attendees, these are hosted privately at the  a href="https://t-rob.net/links/" rel="nofollow" Store and Forward /a  web site.    
 
 p Finally, if you are planning to attend  a href="http://www.ibm.com/IMPACT" rel="nofollow" the IMPACT conference /a  you usually get to take one or two tests for free.  Since these are normally $250 USD this offsets a big chunk of the conference fee.  I'd recommend taking the assessment tests for $30 each before the conference, study on the weak areas and then take the real tests at the conference for free.  Check the registration site to see what this year's offer is for testing since it changes from time to time, but I'm pretty sure you get at least one test free.

You can fire one up as a producer and another (or two or three or four) as a consumer to test out a queue or topic.  The code is very simple non-gui which makes it an excellent starting point for experimentation.  You could for example, easily modify it to set message expiry or bridge between topics and queues.

 ol  
 li Performing a GET in WMQ does indeed make the message unavailable to other readers. A GET outside of syncpoint permanently dequeues the message immediately whereas a GET under syncpoint makes the message unavailable to other readers unless a BACKOUT occurs. A BROWSE operation however provides no such protection. /li  
 li The queue manager mediates access to the messages.  There is no direct manipulation by the MQ application of the queue or message internals, and thus no opportunity for the .Net wrapper to manipulate a "Read flag". /li  
 li The wait interval is how long the outstanding GET blocks the program if the queue has no available messages and with a value of 1000 that interval is one second.  If there are many messages on the queue and the program loops immediately, the effective polling interval is however long it takes the program to process the message.  The wait interval has no affect on throughput dequeueing messages from a deep queue since the queue manager never has to wait for a message to arrive. /li  
 li WMQ offers a number of different levels of reliability.  These are controlled by things such as message persistence, acknowledge mode and transactionality.  For example, a non-persistent message retrieved outside of a unit of work provides at-most-once reliability. /li  
 /ol  
 
 p With regard to threading and synchronization, the  em WebSphere MQ: Using .Net /em  manual  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.csqzav.doc/un10570_.htm" rel="nofollow" has this to say /a :    
 
 blockquote  
   p The implementation of WebSphereÂ® MQ 
  .NET ensures that, for a given 
  connection (MQQueueManager object 
  instance), all access to the target 
  WebSphere MQ queue manager is 
  synchronized. The default behaviour is 
  that a thread that wants to issue a 
  call to a queue manager is blocked 
  until all other calls in progress for 
  that connection are complete. If you 
  require simultaneous access to the 
  same queue manager from multiple 
  threads within your program, create a 
  new MQQueueManager object for each 
  thread that requires concurrent 
  access. (This is equivalent to issuing 
  a separate MQCONN call for each 
  thread.)    
   
   p If the default connection options are 
  overridden by 
  MQC.MQCNO_HANDLE_SHARE_NONE or 
  MQC.MQCNO_SHARE_NO_BLOCK then the 
  queue manager is no longer 
  synchronized.    
 /blockquote  
 
 p So the synchronization is done for you but the exact behavior depends on whether each thread has its own connection.  This is because transactions are connection-scoped.  If one connection serves many threads and one of the threads calls COMMIT then all threads under that connection are in the same unit of work and all COMMIT at once.    
 
 p There are a couple of possibilities that can result in duplicate messages other than browsing them.  All of these are variations on messages being backed out.  Backouts may not always be under program control.  When many transactions are under syncpoint simultaneously, several tuning limits come into play including MAXUOW, log file primary and secondary extents and several others.  If any of these limits are exceeded, the QMgr will cancel the oldest outstanding unit of work to make room for the next one.  Another reason backouts occur is if the client connection is interrupted.  In this case any GETS under syncpoint are rolled back and the messages become available again.    
 
 p One way to determine whether this is happening is to inspect the backout count of the messages as they are read.  A robust messaging application will routinely check this value as part of poison message handling and requeue (or delete and log) messages where the backout count exceeds some arbitrary threshold.  This prevents an unreadable message from permanently locking a thread.  When duplicate messages are seen it might be helpful to log any messages where the backout count exceeds zero rather than simply requeueing those that exceed the threshold.    
 
 p Another way to see exactly what is happening is to use the  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.amqzag.doc/fa15280_.htm" rel="nofollow" tracing facilities of WMQ /a  or  a href="http://bit.ly/SupportPacMA0W" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MA0W /a .  Either of these will show exactly what API calls are being performed, by which applications and threads, and with which options.  If your trace shows that duplicate messages are being delivered to non-browse GET calls without BACKOUT occurring, then it is a defect for which you can request a fix.    
 
 p There is a slight chance if you are using older .Net code that the problem is a defect that has been fixed.  I did not see any defects in the fix lists that would result in duplicate messages but if your .Net client is not at a recent v7 you should be considering upgrading soon anyway.  The v7 classes are much more functional, and in fact are now fully integrated into WMQ and supported.  There is also the small matter of WMQ v6 going end-of-support as of September 2011.  You can get the latest WMQ client in  a href="http://bit.ly/SupportPacMQC7" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MQC7 /a .  If you have already installed a v7 client and need to upgrade to v7.0.1.4 you can install the latest client over the older v7 one or apply the latest Fix Pack (FP 7.0.1.4 as of this writing) from the  a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171 ;amp;uid=swg27006037" rel="nofollow" Recommended Fixes page /a .  The Fix Pack upgrades client as well as server installations.

 ul  
 li QueueConnectionFactory --  ConnectionFactory /li  
 li QueueSession --  Session /li  
 li Queue --  Destination /li  
 /ul  
 
 p Once you switch to the unified domain, the application does not need to know whether a destination is a queue or a topic.  For example, if your app has two managed objects  code myInputDest /code  and  code myOuputDest /code  you can assign either of these to a queue or a topic in your managed object definitions (sometimes referred to as the .bindings file) in any combination.  You can read from the queue and write to a topic, read from a topic and write to a queue, go queue-to-queue or topic-to-topic and all of this is resolved at run time and can change between program invocations just by changing the managed objects.

   p AMQ9532: Program cannot set queue 
  attributes.    
   
   p EXPLANATION: The attempt to set the 
  attributes of queue 
  'SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMIT.QUEUE' on 
  queue manager 'QMGR.SERVER6A' failed 
  with reason code 2102.    
 /blockquote  
 
 p The 2102 is MQRC_RESOURCE_PROBLEM and presumably the resource issue referred to in the posting.  The 2102 can be any kind of scarce resource, including semaphores, user processes, queue handles, etc.  Since the QMgr was attempting to set an attribute of the queue, it would have already had a thread instantiated but it would have required additional queue handles.  When something like this occurs, use your admin tool (WMQ Explorer, mqmon or one of the many 3rd party tools) to look into the number of open queue handles, open channels, etc.  Note that for a resource error, it will be necessary to maintain an open connection to the QMgr or else the tool will be unable to make a new connection when the resource shortage occurs.

 blockquote  
   p AMQ9999: Channel program ended 
  abnormally.    
   
   p EXPLANATION: Channel program 
  'Channel.Coord00' ended abnormally.    
   
   p ACTION: Look at previous error 
  messages for channel program 
  'C00.US.MP00' in the error files to 
  determine the cause of the failure.    
 /blockquote  
 
 p This error appears to actually be two different errors since it references two different channels.  One of these appears to be an outbound cluster channel and the other appears to be a point-to-point channel.  Neither channel mentioned in this error are associated with the first and last error message.    
 
 p  hr     
 
 blockquote  
   p 03/06/11 08:24:26 AMQ9544: Messages 
  not put to destination queue.    
   
   p EXPLANATION: During the processing of 
  channel 'Channel.Server6A' one or more 
  messages could not be put to the 
  destination queue and attempts were 
  made to put them to a dead-letter 
  queue. The location of the queue is 1, 
  where 1 is the local dead-letter queue 
  and 2 is the remote dead-letter queue.    
   
   p ACTION: Examine the contents of the 
  dead-letter queue. Each message is 
  contained in a structure that 
  describes why the message was put to 
  the queue, and to where it was 
  originally addressed. Also look at 
  previous error messages to see if the 
  attempt to put messages to a 
  dead-letter queue failed. The program 
  identifier (PID) of the processing 
  program was '1372200'.    
 /blockquote  
 
 p The last error appears to be an inbound cluster channel.  Since the first error was trying to set attributes of the cluster transmit queue, it could only have been associated with an outbound channel.  Therefore the first and last error messages are unrelated.  This error message appears to show an inbound message that was destined for a queue and that queue was full, PUT-disabled, or otherwise unable to accept the message.  The message was therefore routed to the dead letter queue.

<value columnNumber="1"> p The premise behind async messaging, especially when using an MDB, is that each message is atomic.  That is to say, the outcome of processing any one message is supposed to be independent of the outcome of processing any other message.  The ideal solution to your problem will preserve this atomicity of messages.    
 
 p If you were to process multiple messages in the same unit of work, then you would lose this atomicity.  For example, suppose you decided to syncpoint at every 25 messages.  If the 25th message had an error, such as a code page conversion problem that prevented it from being retrieved from the queue, the entire batch of messages would be backed out.  They would then all be redelivered.  The redelivery count for the messages would increment with each read/backout cycle.  Once the redelivery count had exceeded the threshold set in your app server, all 25 of the messages would be discarded or requeued, depending on your configuration.  The larger the batch, the more messages are potentially affected in an error situation because the entire batch lives or dies together.  Set your batch size to 100 and 100 messages will be at risk in the event of a single poison message.    
 
 p An alternative solution is to allow for many processing threads in your MDB.  With JMS you can spawn many sessions under the same connection.  Each session can manage it's own unit of work, therefore each session can independently start an XA transaction, get a message, update the database and then commit the transaction.  If one message is bad, only that message and database update are affected.    
 
 p There are exceptions to this.  For example, if processing a large batch and the messages all originate from the same producer, it is common to use something other than an MDB to fetch many messages and update many rows under the same unit of work.  Similarly, if the messages are sequence-dependent then parallel processing is not possible because it would not preserve sequence.  But then again, sequence dependent messages are not atomic.  Again, in this case an MDB is not the ideal solution.    
 
 p Depending on your transport provider, the number of threads supported may be limited only by memory storage.  WebSphere MQ for example can easily handle hundreds of simultaneous getter threads on a queue.  Check the tuning for your app server's MDB configuration to see how many threads you can spin up and then verify that your transport can handle the load.  Then play around a bit to find the optimum number of threads.  Performance will increase dramatically as threads increase from one, but only up to a point.  Past that point you generally see a plateau, then a decline as thread management overhead offsets the performance gains.  Where the swe3et spot lies depends on how heavily the messaging broker is loaded and whether it is most constrained by CPU, memory, disk or network.

<value columnNumber="1"> p In your case the  code MQRC_Q_SPACE_NOT_AVAILABLE /code  does in fact reflect the total amount of space in the disk partition, however this is not true in all cases.  For example, with older filesystems the largest file size possible was 2GB, even though the partition could hold up to about 1TB.  So if a single queue file reaches 2GB the QMgr may still have plenty of space in the partition available to requeue a message to the DLQ.  Although newer file systems have eliminated the 2GB file limit, WebSphere MQ does still support many file systems which have this 2GB-per-file restriction.  On platforms were this restriction is not present (or in any case when the entire partition runs out of space, regardless of platform) the behavior does no harm.  On those platforms where the requeue is likely to be successful, the behavior you have observed is appropriate and even desirable.    
 
 p So there is a difference between exhausting space for a single queue file versus exhausting all the file space in the partition.  WebSphere MQ could inquire on aspects of the file system to determine in detail which case caused the error but that would add complexity to the code.  What is simple and fast is to attempt a requeue when the operating system returns an out-of-space error.  If the partition has space available, the requeue works.  If not, then the app is no worse off than it was before the requeue attempt.

With Tomcat, you won't be able to see the behaviors of WAS and would only see them once you get into production.  In fact, IBM wrote a 400+ page of some of the migration issues you might face (http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg246690.html).

Try doing a make-clean/build-all (Project   Clean in Eclipse). Try restarting your IDE. Try deleting the source, or even the project, and checking it out of source control from scratch.    
 
 p The last thing I can think of is that it could be a Classpath issue. Is there any possibility that you have a jar file in the project with a class named "antworten" that you could be getting instead of the one you are expecting? I have seen some very weird things happen in the past, for instance, when two apps were installed on WebSphere and they used different versions of the same library. There were two different versions of the same class on the classpath. The result was  strong totally /strong  mystifying. I had a very unpleasant afternoon helping a co-worker figure it out.

<value columnNumber="1"> p The other responses and comments are correct.  Your  code rsh /code  command needs to execute both the ksh script and the subsequent command in the same invocation.  However, I thought I'd offer an additional suggestion.    
 
 p It appears that you are writing custom instrumentation for WebSphere MQ.  Your approach is to remote shell to the WMQ server and execute a command to display queue attributes (probably depth).    
 
 p The objective of writing your own instrumentation is admirable, however attempting to do it as remote shell is not an optimal approach.  It requires you to maintain a library of scripts on each MQ server and in some cases to maintain these scripts in different languages.    
 
 p I would suggest that a MUCH better approach is to use the MQSC client available in  a href="http://bit.ly/SupportPacMO72" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MO72 /a .  This allows you to write the scripts once, and then execute them from a central server.  Since the MQSC commands are all done via MQ client, the same script handles Windows, UNIX, Linux, iSeries, etc.    
 
 p For example, you could write a script that remotely queried queue depths and printed a list of all queues with depth   0.  You could then either execute this script directly against a given queue manager or write a script to iterate through a list of queue managers and collect the same report for the entire network.  Since the scripts are all running on the one central server, you do not have to worry about getting  code $PATH /code  right, differences in commands like tr or grep, where ksh or perl are installed, etc., etc.    
 
 p Ten years ago I wrote the scripts you are working on when my WMQ network was small.  When the network got bigger, these platform differences ate me alive and I was unable to keep the automation up and running.  When I switched to using WMQ client and had only one set of scripts I was able to keep it maintained with far less time and effort.    
 
 p The following script assumes that the QMgr name is the same as the host name except in UPPER CASE.  You could instead pass QMgr name, hostname, port and channel on the command line to make the script useful where QMgr names do not match the host name.

<value columnNumber="1"> p The  code WMQInitialContextFactory /code  is a class that implements a JNDI provider over a WebSphere MQ queue.  Instead of the managed objects being stored in a .bindings file or LDAP, they are serialized and stored in a queue and this class allows you to treat that queue as just another JNDI store.  This class was only ever intended to be a JNDI provider and not a replacement for the actual IBM JMS implementation.  Since storing managed objects on a topic would not work, these classes have no topic factories in them.  This is as expected.    
 
 p In my opinion, the problem with  code WMQInitialContextFactory /code  is that it must first connect to WebSphere MQ in order to to obtain a connection factory which then tells the app - you guessed it - how to connect to WebSphere MQ.  This makes the article that was linked confusing because it appears that all that configuration, the WMQ connection details and so forth, are for the benefit of the application when in fact they just bootstrap a JNDI provider which is expected to have defined connection factory objects with all this same information.    
 
 p What is missing from the article is that the author would have had to use IBM's JMSAdmin tool to connect to the MQInitialContext and define the ConnectionFactory and other administered objects before connecting the application to that same Initial Context in order to access them.    
 
 p For the record, the WebSphere MQ JMS classes have supported JMS 1.1 ConnectionFactory and Destination classes for quite some time now.  Prior to that they supported both queues and topics as per the JMS 1.0 spec.      
 
 p You can download the IBM WMQ JMS implementation as  a href="http://bit.ly/SupportPacMQC7" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MQC7 /a .  There is a lot more there than just the jar files.  For example, you get lots of sample code, diagnostic and trace utilities, documentation, etc.  You also get the correct jar files.    
 
 p If you want to use a .bindings file (File-system initial context) instead of the  code WMQInitialContextFactory /code , download the latest WebSphere MQ Explorer tool as  a href="http://bit.ly/SupportPacMS0T" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MS0T /a .  You can create a directory, point WMQ Explorer to it and define all your connection factories and destinations.  (Or go with domain-specific QueueConnectionFactory and TopicConnectionFactory if you rock it old school.)  More information on using WMQ Explorer to define your managed objects may be found at:  em  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.explorer.doc/j_jmsadmin_intro.htm" rel="nofollow" Creating and configuring JMS administered objects /a  /em

You don't have direct access to the code that it generates, so, when you see stack traces in that code, its difficult to figure out what's going on.     
 
 p Moreover, you end up being very limited to whatever that within WPF's paradigm, and things get tough when you have to do something outside of its boundaries. You get a lot more flexibility with Spring Portlet MVC, including the advantage that the skills you are using have application outside of the strict, portal context.

<value columnNumber="1"> p JMS offers a set of APIs for messaging: put a message on a queue, someone else, sometime later, perhaps geographically far away takes the message off the queue and processes it. We have decoupled in time and location of the message provider and consumer. Even if the message consumer happens to be down for a time we can keep producing messages.    
 
 p JMS also offers a publish/subscribe capability where the producer puts the message to a "topic" and any interested parties can subscribe to that topic, receiving messages as and when they are produced, but for the moment focus just on the queue capabilty.    
 
 p We have decoupled some aspects of the relationship between provider and consumer. However some coupling remains. First, as things stand every message is processed in the same way. Suppose we want to introduce different kinds of processing for different kinds of messages:    
 
 pre  code  if ( message.customer.type == Platinum ) 
      do something special 
 /code   re  
 
 p Obviously we can write code like that, but an alternative would be to have a messaging system that can send different messages to different places we set up three queues:    
 
 pre  code  Request Queue, the producer(s) puts their requests here 
 Platinum Queue, platinum consumer processing reads from here 
 Standard Queue, a standard consumer reads messages from here 
 /code   re  
 
 p And then all we need is a little bit of cleverness in the queue system itself to transfer then messsage from the Request Queue to the Platinum Queue or Standard Queue.    
 
 p So this is a Content-Based Routing capability, and is something that an ESB provides. Note that the ESB uses the fundamental Queueing capabilities offered by JMS.    
 
 p A second kind of couppling is that the consumer and producer must agree about the message format. In simple cases that's fine. But when you start to have many producers all putting message to the same queue you start to hit versioning problems.  New message formats are introduced but you don't want to change all the existing providers.     
 
 pre  code   Request Version 1 Queue  Existing providers write here 
  Request Version 2 Queue  New provider write here, New Consumer Reads here 
 /code   re  
 
 p And the ESB picks up the Version 1 Queue messages and transforms them into Version 2 messages and puts them onto the Version 2 queue.    
 
 p Message transformation is another possible ESB capability.    
 
 p Have a look at ESB products, see what they can do. As I work for IBM, I'm most familiar with  a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/wsesb/" rel="nofollow" WebSphere ESB /a

 p Difference between a Web Server, Web Container, and an Application Server    
 
 p A  strong Web Server /strong  is a server capable of receiving HTTP requests, interpreting them, processing the corresponding HTTP Responses and sending them to the appropriate clients (Web Browsers). Example: Apache Web Server. Read more about Web Servers and their working      
 
 p A  strong Web Container /strong  is a J2EE compliant implementation which provides an environment for the Servlets and JSPs to run. Putting it differently we can say that a Web Container is combination of a Servlet Engine and a JSP Engine. If an HTTP Request refers to a Web Component (typically a Servlet or a JSP) then the request is forwarded to the Web Container and the result of the request is sent back to Web Server, which uses that result to prepare the HTTP Response for the particular HTTP Request. Example: Tomcat is a typical Web Container. A typical setup would be to have Apache HTTP Server as the Web Server and Tomcat as the Web Container.    
 
 p An  strong Application Server /strong  is a complete server, which provides an environment for running the business components (EJBs, ADF BCs, etc.) in addition to providing the capabilities of a Web Container as well as of a Web Server. Example: Bea WebLogic, IBM WebSphere, Oracle 
Application Server, etc.

   p  strong Introduction to batch programming using WebSphere Extended Deployment Compute Grid /strong  
   em Christopher Vignola, WebSphere 
  Architect, IBM /em     
   
   p Commonly thought of as a 
  legacy "mainframe" technology, batch 
  processing is showing itself to be a 
  venerable workload style with growing 
  demand in Javaâ„¢ and distributed 
  environments. This article introduces 
  an exciting new capability for Java 
  batch processing from IBMÂ®, the leader 
  in batch processing systems for the 
  last 40 years. This content is part of 
  the IBM WebSphere Developer Technical 
  Journal.    
   
   p WebSphere Extended Deployment Compute 
  rid provides a simple abstraction of 
  a batch job step and its inputs and 
  outputs. The programming model is 
  concise and straightforward to use. 
  The built-in checkpoint/rollback 
  mechanism makes it easy to build 
  robust, restartable Java batch 
  applications.    
   
   p The Batch Simulator utility provided 
  with this article offers an 
  alternative test environment that runs 
  inside your Eclipse (or Rational 
  Application Developer) development 
  environment. Its xJCL generator can 
  help jump start you to the next phase 
  of testing in the Compute Grid unit 
  test server.

 p There ARE advantages to use green screens: it's fast and it's almost unbeatable at data entry, provided you get used to it.     
 
 p But to answer your question, the iSeries is a J2EE enabled machine: a HTTP server comes installed and depending of the version of the iSeries, WebSphere might be already installed, or are entitled to install it. Then you can use JT400, which is the java toolkit for the os400 containing the jdbc drivers to connect the database and the necessary classes for calling programs.

 p Once we realized the issue with setting foreign cookies, we decided we had a few options:    
 
 ol  
 li  strong Proxy /strong  - Tunnel through the portal to the 
remote application, using the portal 
as a proxy. This option is the most 
straightforward logically, but it 
has complications as mentioned above 
(i.e. you have to modify each 
request and each response - adding 
cookies and markup as necessary). 
This method turned out to be a pain 
point for us, not unrelated to our 
use of IBM WebSphere Portal 7. /li  
 li  strong 3rd party SSO solution /strong  - Use CAS or Tivoli or some other enterprise solution. This is our 
ideal final solution, but it is 
still being researched to determine 
compatibility with our environment. /li  
 li  strong Cookie Monster /strong  - Our interim solution, in order to 
get IBM portal out of the way as the 
middle man, was to deploy a small 
new remote application on the same 
server as our target app that simply 
accepts a cookie in JSON format and 
spits it back to the browser in a 
302 redirect response. /li  
 /ol  
 
 p The cookie monster solution works as follows: when the 
    user clicks on the link in the 
    portal, our portlet will internally 
    lookup the user's credentials, 
    authenticate to the remote 
    application, and return the 
    authentication cookie/token. We 
    convert that (as well as the 
    destination URL) to JSON and return 
    it to the browser. The browser then 
    posts this JSON to the remote cookie 
    application in a new window. The 
    cookie is reconstituted and placed 
    in the response along with the 302 
    and the target location. Voila, the 
    page redirects to the application 
    homepage and the user is logged in. Yay!    
 
 p Some notes for anyone using IBM WebSphere Portal:    
 
 ul  
 li We handled the authentication via 
resource-serving portlet. /li  
 li Make sure the response from the resource-serving portlet is not cached (we made the cache expire immediately as we could not return no-cache) /li  
 li Make sure you ping the portal before making the ajax call as the session may be expired. /li  
 /ul  
 
 p I'm sure there are other, more elegant solutions, but this is working for us until we get CAS/Tivoli up and running.

All of those will give you real, JSR compliant, portlet containers. If you decide to go that route (as apposed to using apache tiles to aggregate at the glass and avoid the hassle of a portal or going to a non-portal technology such as Adobe Flex  ;amp; Mosaic) you then get to choose how you access the legacy applications:     
 
 ol  
 li  p Using the portlet-servlet bridge, if your portal server has one;     /li  
 li  p Try and link the truly legacy applications with an IFrame portlet.     /li  
 li  p Re-implement the user interface functionality (you were using the MVC(s) pattern, right?) as portlets.     /li  
 /ol

I have not worked with anyone that has changed JMS providers, though...    
 
 p IBM provides a bunch of Java libraries that only reference the javax.jms package, so as long as you haven't let any vendor-specific enhancements into your code, you should be able to slot in the MQ libraries to have MQ become your JMS provider. (You may need to do some administration with the MQ tooling to do things like set up JMS subscriptions, however... I haven't used the JMS aspects of MQ, only the core libraries.)

<value columnNumber="1"> p  strong Problem(Abstract): /strong   To diagnose the problems related to hang or poor performance of customer applications running on WebSphere Application Server Community Edition, users would be required to generate the various dumps and send them to IBM Support for diagnosis.     
 
 p This technote explains how to generate required dumps when WebSphere Application Server Community Edition is running as an operating system service. This technote applies to IBM Java SDK 1.5.0 and IBM Java SDK 1.6.0     
 
 p  strong Cause /strong : When customer applications experience hang or poor performance with WebSphere Application Server Community Edition on IBM Java SDK 1.5.0 or IBM Java SDK 1.6.0, and the server is running as an operating system service, the corresponding command/shell window of the server process is not available to users. As a result, user signals can not be sent from the keyboard to trigger dumps.    
 
 p  strong Resolving the problem: /strong  When the JVM process command window is available, generating dumps is straight forward as follows:    
 
 p  em Windows: /em   
If the JVM setting is configured to trigger the dumps at user signal, press  code CRTL+Break /code  on the command window to generate the dumps.    
 
 p  em Linux: /em  If the JVM setting is configured to generate the dumps at user signal, press  code CTRL+\ /code  on the shell window.    
 
 p  em AIX: /em  If the JVM setting is configured to generate the dumps at user signal, press  code CTRL+\ /code  on the shell window.    
 
 p Note: In order to generate java core dump, system core dump, heap dump and a snap dump at user signal, the dump agents must be configured through JVM options as follows:    
 
 pre  code -Xdump:java+heap+system+snap:events=user 
 /code   re  
 
 p For more information on how to configure dump agents, visit using  code -Xdump /code .    
 
 p However, if WebSphere Application Server Community Edition is running as an operating system service, the command window may not be available. This case will also arise when JVM process is started with javaw.exe on windows.    
 
 p In the preceding circumstances, user is required to find the corresponding process-id of the JVM process and use operating system vendor supplied or IBM supplied tools to generate the dumps by following the below steps.    
 
 p  em Windows: /em   WinDbg can be downloaded from Microsoft Dev tools site to generate system core dumps. Use the following command at the WinDbg console to generate the system core dump:    
 
 pre  code dump /f   dumpfile   
 /code   re  
 
 p Where dumpfile includes the directory path and the name of the system core dump file.  
Make sure that  code /f /code  option is used instead of  code /ma /code . The  code /f /code  generates full dump where as  code /ma /code  generates mini dump. Only full dumps are supported with the jextract tool supplied with IBM Java SDK 1.5.0/1.6.0.     
 
 p SendSignal utility for Windows. For this, the JVM must be setup to generate the dumps on user signals. To generate the java core dump, heap dump, system core dump and a snap dump at user signal, the following option must be supplied to JVM at startup:    
 
 pre  code -Xdump:java+heap+system+snap:events=user  
 /code   re  
 
 p Note: The SendSignal utility can be used to generate all types of dumps where as WinDbg generate only system core dumps.    
 
 p  code Linux and AIX /code :  The signal for Linux and AIX is  code SIGQUIT /code . Use the command to send the user signal to trigger the various dumps:    
 
 pre  code kill -3   PID    
 /code   re  
 
 p For this, JVM must be setup to generate the dumps on user signal. To generate the java core dump, heap dump, system core dump and a snap sump at user signal, the following option must be supplied to JVM at startup.     
 
 pre  code -Xdump:java+heap+system+snap:events=user  
 /code   re  
 
 p Note: System core dump files must processed using the jextract tool and the output must be send to IBM support. The jextract from the same JVM that experienced the problem should be used to process the system core dump:    
 
 pre  code   JAVA_HOME /jre/bin/jextract   dumpfile     
 /code   re  
 
 p Where dumpfile is the filename of the system core dump.     
 
 p This will produce a zip file .zip. The zip file needs to be sent to IBM support.

 p From time to time, some very fussy EJB container providers (cough.... WebSphere... cough)  will actually enforce these restrictions through java security policies, but I would say about half of those restrictions are routinely ignored  ( I mean just using  strong log4j /strong  in your MDB potentially violates about 30% of them).    
 
 p Violating the the other 70% probably indicates some architectural or design problem.    
 
 p So, can you call  strong System.exit() /strong  in an MDB ? The  a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/jboss-user@lists.sourceforge.net/msg26348.html" rel="nofollow" answer /a  is yes, but only once... :)    
 
 p It sounds like, in your case, you  em need /em  some of these restrictions to reign in potentially misbehaving plugins. I don't know if MDBs are going to get you out of that problem. I suppose it depends on how much you trust the third party developers, but rather than use the invocation based models in EJB, I would install the components as JMX ModelMBeans. You can use the java security model to limit what they can do, but I suppose that would defeat the purpose.    
 
 p Perhaps using some run (or load) time AOP byte code engineering, you could rewrite all requests for threads to be redirected to a per component thread factory that you allocate and limits the threads that can be created. Because you don't want to stop them from doing whatever it is that they do, you just don't want them to take down the whole server when they crash/stall/misbehave.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I'm not the most knowledgeable about Spring, but am pretty familiar with SCA from having worked with it in IBM's WebSphere Integration Developer IDE and the environments it deploys to: WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus and WebSphere Process Server.    
 
 p It really all has to do with abstraction and the thought of allowing developers to focus on what is most important - business logic. We are all familiar with the concept of Object-Oriented Programming and how that abstraction better represents the "real world". Then along comes web services and the service-oriented architecture approach. Web services further abstract our logic by making it less dependent on what language is behind our logic. Now C++ or .Net or Java or even RPG or COBOL or whatever could be behind our web service. We can get languages and systems to talk to each other in a way that doesn't depend on CORBA and libraries and what not.    
 
 p SCA (Service Component Architecture) attempts to take SOA to the next level. It attempts to abstract the protocol and address used to talk to another system or service. Here's the why: With working with web services, you as a developer still need to work with protocol and write or hook in a LOT of boilerplate code. You have to know if you are http or https. You have to know if you are (in the Java world) JAX-RPC, JAX-WS 2.0, JAX-WS 2.1, JAX-WS 2.2 or even JAX-RS (REST based). You need to know if you are working with JSON, XML, or SOAP and if SOAP, is it 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2? And sometimes you even have to know how the vendor of your application server implements certain things (you shouldn't, but it can be the case). And then what happens if you want your web service to talk to another service. But that second service happens to be messaging based. Does that mean JMS? MQ? JMS over MQ? other? And what about just pure HTTP POST and GET?    
 
 p This is where SCA comes in. SCA attempts to abstract the end points of your services and hide the protocol implementation from you the developer. When you need a service you just look it up via the SCA API's and then invoke the service (I think the method is execute? At least it is in IBM's extension of SCA). But anyway....Now you do not have to know that the service you are communicating with is JAX-WS 2.1 or REST or even MQ. You don't have to know that you working with SOAP/HTTP or JSON/XML or SOAP/JMS or whatever. SCA hides this all from you. It allows you to connect services of differing implementations to each other so they can all talk to one another via a common "service interface".    
 
 p As you can imagine, this is another layer of abstraction and technology on top of existing abstracted technologies. But having seen it myself, I believe it is worth looking into. I know IBM and Apache (and I think others that just don't come to mind at the moment) worked on coming up with the SCA standard. (And actually IBM's version of SCA is now built on the open standard that Apache presented. Hopefully other vendors that support SCA do the same.)    
 
 p I think it is worth taking the time to look at. It can help you to focus not so much on the integration of services based on their protocols, but rather the business logic of the services, which is really the value they bring to the table.

<value columnNumber="1"> p There are a number of ways in which WebSphere MQ messages can be delayed and diagnosing may take a little detective work.  Here are a few of the more common causes:    
 
 ol  
 li Message stuck under syncpoint.  Although it would be unusual for a message to sit under syncpoint for days, I've seen it happen.  The issue is that some applications are designed to batch up several messages in a single transaction and when messages do not arrive in a batch multiple, the remainder of the messages sit and wait for another message(s) to arrive and close the batch. /li  
 li Message stuck under syncpoint.  In another case, the program logic does not commit a syncpoint until the next message is read.  When several threads are processing messages, distribution of load is not necessarily uniform across all threads and one can be starved for messages if the load is light. /li  
 li Message orphaned by browse.  In this scenario, a message arrives at a higher priority than the current browse cursor.  If the rescan interval is set extremely high and traffic volume also high, it may take a while before the browse cursor is reset to the top of the queue. /li  
 li Program error.  You didn't mention which version of WMQ client and server you are using (hopefully both at 7.0!) but occasionally there are issues that cause threads to hang.  These can tie up a message under syncpoint.  It is always a good idea to go to the  a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=171 ;amp;uid=swg27006037" rel="nofollow" latest FixPack for your version /a  and check the link called "Problems fixed in..." to see if an APAR addresses your specific issue.  If so, apply the latest Fix Pack. /li  
 /ol  
 
 p To start diagnosing this, use the  code DIS QSTATUS /code  command to display the number of input and output handles on the queue, the message age and any outstanding units of work.  You can also use the exit in  a href="http://bit.ly/SupportPacMA0W" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MA0W /a  to get a human-readable trace of all API calls on a given queue.  This can be an extremely valuable diagnostic tool because you can tell exactly how long a message sat under syncpoint, whether it is being continuously backed out and re-read, what options are used for the API call, etc.  You can even limit the trace to specific queues or specific threads which is helpful if you need to let it run for a while.

If it is the latter, I suspect you may be looking at the wrong MBeanServer instance, since WAS technically has more than one running.    
 
 p Either way, to bypass all that nonsense, your best bet is to add a  a href="http://www.docjar.com/docs/api/javax/management/remote/JMXConnectorServer.html" rel="nofollow" JMXConnectorServer /a  definition in your Spring XML. That way, you control exactly how the JMX connections should be made, and it will use the standard J2SE RMI remoting, so you know your JConsole will connect to it easily.

   java  -jar  cf.jar  SEARCH  [DIRECTORY]  [OPTIONS]... 
 
Searches all JAR files in the current directory and its sub-directories for 
entries matching the SEARCH argument. If DIRECTORY is provided, searching will 
be done in that location instead of the current directory. 
 
SEARCH: 
 
  A search string containing the class name (entry name). Wild card (*) is 
  supported. Package separator can be either of `/', `\' or `.'. 
 
  Examples: 
 
    java.lang.String 
    java/util/ArrayList 
    java/lang/Str*B*er 
 
  If non ".class" entries also need to be searched, option -a (--all-types) 
  should be specified. Please see the OPTIONS section for a more detailed 
  explanation. 
 
DIRECTORY: 
 
  If this is not provided, current directory and all its sub-directories will 
  be used for performing the search. However, if this argument is provided, 
  the same and its sub-directories will be used as the location to fetch JAR 
  files from. 
 
  If a recursive scan is not needed, option -s (--shallow) can be specified. 
 
OPTIONS: 
 
  -h          --help 
                   Shows this help 
  -o [path]   --redirect-output 
                   Redirect output to a file path supplied. 
  -x [x1,x2]  --archive-extensions 
                   Extensions in addition to the default ".jar". Comma or space 
                   separated list accepted. 
  -i          --insensitive-case 
                   Case insensitive search. 
  -q          --quiet 
                   Silent search without the progress bar animation. 
  -a          --all-types 
                   Removes the filtering on ".class" types so that other types 
                   such as ".properties", ".xml", etc can also be searched for. 
  -s          --shallow 
                   Performs a shallow search. Doesn't recurse. 
 
Examples: 
 
   java  -jar  cf.jar  org/apache/log4j/Level  D:\Frameworks

<value columnNumber="1"> p When an application reads a message inside of a unit of work, WMQ has no idea whether there are any other messages in the same unit of work.  If the message turns out to be a poison message, WMQ requeues it to the backout queue  em in the same unit of work as everything else /em .  If WMQ were to move the message outside a unit of work, there's a chance it could be lost or duplicated.  If WMQ committed the UOW on your behalf then there's a chance it could commit messages you've retrieved but not completely processed.  So WMQ makes you explicitly commit between units of work if performing backout processing.      
 
 p The behavior you are seeing sound like the messages are being held on the backout queue under syncpoint.  When the app is shut down an implicit  code BACKOUT /code  occurs and all the messages go back to their original queue.  You need at least one successful unit of work to make the messages stay in the backout queue.  Try putting a good message on the input queue behind the bad ones and then execute an explicit  code COMMIT /code .    
 
 p By the way, WebSphere MQ does not have the concept of a persistent queue.  Persistence is an attribute of the message.  The queue has an attribute  code DEFPSIST /code  which tells the app whether to make a message persistent or not when the message is first created.  Persistence of the message will not change as it travels throughout the WMQ network, regardless of the setting of the queues it passes through.  Therefore,  code DEFPSIST /code  on the backout queue has no effect whatsoever since the message persistence was defined before it hit the backout queue.

 p Of the two, I've always preferred two-way comms. It does scale pretty well up to a certain point - tens of thousands of socket/WCF connections are possible as long as the server uses asynchronous APIs (and in particular does  em not /em  use the "one thread per connection" design abomination).    
 
 p The polling method does create more unnecessary network traffic, but it  em may /em  be better if you're scaling past a single server. It seems to me that you can scale out to a web farm fairly easily using existing technology, and such scaling (I think) would be easier if you're using a polling method. I've never had to scale that far, though.    
 
 p I haven't used MSMQ for this type of communication, but have used IBM's WebSphere (a similar technology). Message queueing comes with its own set of problems for automation, such as handling dead-letter queues, etc. It's useful if you expect the server to be down for a period of time (or if you have unreliable "middleware" between client and server), but in general I've preferred bidirectional communication over sockets or WCF.

 p I try to find a best process to develop Java webapps. After months of trial and error, my web development environment is made up by the following parts:    
 
 p framework: Apache Wicket 1.4.16 
IDE: eclipse Galileo, with m2eclipse plugin 
Build Tools:Maven 2 
Data Access: EclipseLink 2.1.1 via JPA 2.0(with StaticWeave) 
RDBMS: MSSQL 2005 or above with jTDS 
DI: Google Guice 2.0 
developing web container: Jetty server embedded in Maven Jetty plugin. 
Target web container: Tomcat 6.x or above    
 
 p I use maven Jetty plugin to test run my webapps, enable JPDA while line precision tracing is required.     
 
 p Whenever a change is made to the source codes, I have to reload my app to take effect. press ENTER to reload is ok, but after several times of reloads(about 3~5 depends on my PermGen settings), OutOfMemoryException is thrown, than I have to shut down and start up my app again. I know auto reload can be achieved by configuration, but it only leads to OOME faster(due to excess reloads).    
 
 p After googling I realize that there are related to some memory leak problems. I've tried enlarge MaxPermSize settings, but RAM on my rig is limited, and it's not reasonable to set to something really big. BTW, Memory leak detection is introduced in Tomcat 7, and I found most memory leaks are from jTDS, Google Guice and Wicket itself, but I can do nothing about it.    
 
 p Is there anything I can do accelerate my developing process? In order to reduce reload times should I move to a more advanced web container like Glassfish(sorry I can't afford a WebLogic or WebSphere here.) or anything.    
 
 p Thanks in advance, any comments are welcome!

<value columnNumber="1"> p  a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoiceXML" rel="nofollow" VoiceXML (VXML) /a  is the W3C's standard XML format for specifying interactive voice dialogues between a human and a computer. It allows voice applications to be developed and deployed in an analogous way to HTML for visual applications. Just as HTML documents are interpreted by a visual web browser, VoiceXML documents are interpreted by a voice browser.    
 
 p Typically, HTTP is used as the transport protocol for fetching VoiceXML pages. Some applications may use static VoiceXML pages, while others rely on dynamic VoiceXML page generation using an application server like Tomcat, Weblogic, IIS, or WebSphere. br  
Historically, VoiceXML platform vendors have implemented the standard in different ways, and added proprietary features. But the VoiceXML 2.0 standard, adopted as a W3C Recommendation on 16 March 2004, clarified most areas of difference. The VoiceXML Forum, an industry group promoting the use of the standard, provides a conformance testing process that certifies vendors' implementations as conformant.

<value columnNumber="1"> p This is an interesting question.  In V6 and earlier if the User ID field on the WAS configuration panel for WMQ was left blank, WAS would use that value (NULL or blanks) as the ID it presented to WMQ on a connection.  When WMQ receives a connection request that lacks a User ID it connects using the ID associated with the WMQ channel - which is always administrative and therefore always works.    
 
 p As of V7, WMQ was changed to try harder to locate a User ID to send with the connection request.  In the case of Java/JMS programs, the WMQ client will present the ID of the JVM on a connection request if no other ID was provided.  In your case, the app server is now providing an ID whereas before it provided none, and the ID provided is not authorized to WebSphere MQ.    
 
 p The very fact that this has happened means that your queue manager is configured to accept anonymous administrative connections.  The first thing to do here is to lock down all unused inbound channels (those named SYSTEM.* of type RCVR, RQSTR, CLUSRCVR and SVRCONN).  Next, make sure that any channels intended for administrative access (SYSTEM.ADMIN.SVRCONN for example) authenticate connections using an exit and/or SSL.  If SSL is used, insure that SSLPEER is also used to limit the certificates that can connect.    
 
 p Finally, once admin access is locked down, take the ID that is supposed to e used for WAS, authorize it's group accordingly and then put that ID in the channel's MCAUSER attribute.  This will prevent the app from connecting to the channel as an administrator.  If you want to be sure nobody can impersonate the app, set up SSL and/or an exit, the same way you did for the administrative channels.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I already read the discussion about Scala Actors vs. JMS:  a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4648280/scala-actors-vs-jms" Scala Actors vs JMS /a     
 
 p I will play with Akka in the next weeks to get a better understanding about its power and good use cases. It looks really great, and it has a lot of addons besides basic actors, e.g. the Apache Camel integration (I really like Camel).    
 
 p Usually, we use messaging solutions which exist for years already. Either a JMS implementation such as WebSphere MQ or ActiveMQ is used for Point-To-Point communication, or Tibco Rendevous for Multicast messaging. 
They are very stabile and offer high availablity and performance. Nevertheless, configuration and setup is much more complex than using Akka I think?!    
 
 p I wonder why I should use Akka in some of these use cases?    
 
 p I know, it is lightweight and easy to use (if you know Scala besides Java of course). But can you tell me some other reasons why I should think about using Akka instead of WebSphere MQ or Tibco RV in my next project?     
 
 p And when should I still not use Akka? Does it offer the same high availability and performance as the other solutions? Or is it a bad idea to even compare Akka with the other messaging solutions?    
 
 p Maybe there also is another messaging solution in the JVM environment which I should consider besides JMS (Point-to-Point), TibcoRV (Multicast) and Akka?    
 
 p I hope you can give me some information, I would really like to use Akka in one of my next projects...

 p Is there a way to dinamically change the pages title at runtime?    
 
 p I know that you can change the page title at the portal level, but this solution 
doesn't offer any SEO value since it doesn't change the TITLE tag in the page.    
 
 p For what I've seen the way to changing the portal titles are very static (these are global settings):    
 
 ul  
 li Changing the bannerTitleText in the theme policy /li  
 li If that's not present adjust the bannerTitleTextResourceBundle and bannerTitleTextResourceKey to the desired value. /li  
 li Otherwise, set the titles globally at the theme configuration /li  
 /ul  
 
 p Our goal is to be able to set the title at the page level so that it can change from page to page and include the relevant page's keyword.     
 
 p  strong Actually it would be most ideal if this could be done from WCM. /strong     
 
 p  strong Update /strong     
 
 p I noticed that the default theme in WebSphere Portal 6.1.5 was appending the page title, so examined the theme and surely enough the jspInit.jspf had some the following new methods:    
 
 pre  code  
 
private static com.ibm.portal.state.service.PortalStateManagerServiceHome portalStateManagerServiceHome;

    final com.ibm.portal.state.service.PortalStateManagerService psms = portalStateManagerServiceHome.getPortalStateManagerService( (javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest) request, (javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse) response ); 
    return psms; 
} 
protected boolean isStaticPage( javax.servlet.ServletRequest request, javax.servlet.ServletResponse response ) throws com.ibm.portal.ModelException {

My app is a Spring 3.0.5 J2EE app running on WebSphere 6.1 using spring-mvc annotation driven controllers.

<value columnNumber="1"> p The question title frames this as a choice between P2P and pub/sub but the question body frames it as a choice between threaded and pipelined processing.  These are two completely different things.    
 
 p Either code snippet provided could just as easily use P2P or pub/sub to put and get messages.  The decision should not be based on speed but rather whether the interface in question requires a single message to be delivered to multiple receivers.  If the answer is no then you probably want to stick with point-to-point, regardless of your application's threading model.    
 
 p And, incidentally, the answer to the question posed in the title is "no."  When you use the point-to-point model your messages resolve immediately to a destination or transmit queue and WebSphere MQ routes them from there.  With pub/sub your message is handed off to an internal broker process that resolves zero to many possible destinations.  Only after this step does the published message get put on a queue where, for the remainder of it's journey, it then is handled like any other point-to-point message.  Although pub/sub is not normally noticeably slower than point-to-point the code path is longer and therefore, all other things being equal, it will add a bit more latency.    
 
 p The other part of the question is about parallelism.  You proposed either spinning up many threads or breaking the app up so that requests and replies are handled separately.  A third option is to have multiple application instances running.  You can combine any or all of these in your design.  For example, you can spin up multiple request threads and multiple reply threads and then have application instances processing against multiple queue managers.    
 
 p The key to this question is whether the messages have affinity to each other, to order dependencies or to the application instance or thread which created them.  For example, if I am responding to an HTTP request with a request/reply then the thread attached to the HTTP session probably needs to be the one to receive the reply.  But if the reply is truly asynchronous and all I need to do is update a database with the response data then having separate request and reply threads is helpful.    
 
 p In either case, the ability to dynamically spin up or down the number of instances is helpful in managing peak workloads.  If this is accomplished with threading alone then your performance scalability is bound to the upper limit of a single server.  If this is accomplished by spinning up new application instances on the same or different server/QMgr then you get both scalability and workload balancing.    
 
 p Please see the following article for more thoughts on these subjects:  a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/0811_mismes/0811_mismes.html" rel="nofollow" Mission:Messaging: Migration, failover, and scaling in a WebSphere MQ cluster /a       
 
 p Also, go to the  a href="http://bit.ly/SupportPacs" rel="nofollow" WebSphere MQ SupportPacs /a  page and look for the Performance SupportPac for your platform and WMQ version.  These are the ones with names beginning with MP**.  These will show you the performance characteristics as the number of connected application instances varies.

<value columnNumber="1"> p In general, selection based on topic string should be faster.  A side effect of selection on topic in a WebSphere MQ cluster is that messages are not distributed to network nodes that will not consume them.  In WMQ V6 message selectors are implemented at the client so the application still gets every message but only sees the ones that match the selection criteria.  In WMQ V7 the QMgr will perform the selection but the message must get to the QMgr for that to happen.  So if every client is subscribed to the same topic then messages will flow to every QMgr where a client is connected.  But if the clients subscribe at granular points in the topic tree, messages will only go to nodes where something has subscribed to them.    
 
 p Apart from distribution, the question of topic or property selection is greatly influenced by taxonomy.  The design of the topic tree should provide granularity according to the logical data hierarchy but, unlike a file system, there are no "soft links" possible to overlay alternate structures within the tree.  It is a simple hierarchy.      
 
 p In many cases there are data elements which if used in the topic tree would break the taxonomy and yet these are needed for selection.  These are candidates for properties.    
 
 p Topic elements tend to be more categorical in nature.  Items such as region, cost center, department number, branch number tend to fall into topic trees because they serve to partition data according to categorical business requirements.      
 
 p So as a general rule, use topics for those things by which you might summarize transactions. These generally follow the existing and natural taxonomies you already use to define your business.  For example, department or cost center are two common elements.  If you can easily imagine a report broken down by that value, it may be a topic element.  "Show me all transactions from branch 01234" is an example.  Use properties for things that are attributes of specific transactions rather than categories.  Examples here would include color or price.  Chances are "show me all transactions for blue items" sounds wrong because blue is not a categorical element and therefore is probably not a good candidate for the topic tree.  (Unless you are in the paint business!)

 p So in my app, a user is able to successfully log in because they're in the realm, but then when they access a secure page they're getting an ugly "Error 403: AuthorizationFailed" message.    
 
 p Is there a way to limit authentication to users having a particular role? Or am I required to ensure that the user realm only contains users with the required role.    
 
 p In terms of code, I have this declaration in my web.xml:    
 
 pre  code   login-config  
      auth-method FORM  /auth-method  
      realm-name Simple  /realm-name  
      form-login-config  
          form-login-page /login.jsp  /form-login-page  
          form-error-page /loginerror.jsp  /form-error-page  
      /form-login-config  
  /login-config  
 /code   re  
 
 p But it doesn't say anything about required roles, so any user navigating to login.jsp can login successfully if they're in the ream.    
 
 p Then, when the user accesses any of the pages matched by the url-pattern here:    
 
 pre  code   security-constraint  
      display-name Authorised  /display-name  
      web-resource-collection  
          web-resource-name Authenticated and Authorised Resources  /web-resource-name  
          url-pattern /secure/*  /url-pattern  
          http-method PUT  /http-method  
          http-method GET  /http-method  
          http-method POST  /http-method  
      /web-resource-collection  
      auth-constraint  
          role-name simpleWebAppUser  /role-name  
      /auth-constraint  
      user-data-constraint  
          transport-guarantee INTEGRAL  /transport-guarantee  
      /user-data-constraint  
  /security-constraint  
 /code   re  
 
 p That's when the roles are checked.    
 
 p Role "simpleWebAppUser" is application wide, and I want to check that the user has this role before letting the log-in succeed.

<value columnNumber="1"> p There are about 3 or 4 questions here.  Let's see if I can address all of them.    
 
 p First, creating administered objects is completely separate from defining queues in the queue manager. Typically, the WebSphere MQ admin defines the queues and topics, then provides the host, port, channel, QMgr and queue/topic names to the WAS admin who then generates the matching connection factory and queue or topic objects.  Defining the WAS objects does not create the corresponding WMQ objects, nor does it even imply that they exist.  From your description, it sounds as though they may not have been defined on the QMgr.    
 
 p In fact, it is not even obvious from your description that you are using MQ as your transport.  If WAS is configured to use it's own JMS implementation (System Integration Bus or SIBus for short) then the connection factories and other objects may point to SIBus instead of WMQ.  If you created a QCF for WMQ then someone should have already provided the details you are requesting - QMgr name, host, port and channel name.    
 
 p WMQ Explorer is available as a free, stand-alone download called  a href="http://bit.ly/SupportPacMS0T" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MS0T /a .  In order to use it, or any of the other 3rd party desktop tools such as MQ Visual Edit or  a href="http://bit.ly/SupportPacMO72" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MO72 /a  you will need to know the QMgr name as well as host, port and channel name.  In addition, if the WMQ admin has enabled any security, you will need to be authorized to connect and, at a minimum, inquire on WMQ objects.  The WMQ admin will provide these details to you.  Assuming you have the QMgr details and are sufficiently authorized, just download and install SupportPac MS0T and point it at WMQ.  Instructions on all things WMQ (including WMQ Explorer) are at the Infocenter pages.  Since the stand-alone WMQ Explorer is V7 you will want the  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/index.jsp" rel="nofollow" V7 Infocenter /a  for any Explorer help.  If the QMgr is at V6 then you may need to refer to the  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv6/v6r0/index.jsp" rel="nofollow" V6 Infocenter /a  as well.    
 
 p That answers the questions in the body of your post.  The answer to the question in the title - how do I find out the QMgr name - is "ask the WMQ administrator."  You should be given the name when you get the host, port and channel.  That said, you often do not need it.  A WMQ client will connect to any QMgr if provided the host, port and channel.  This is what allows your client app to fail over to a different QMgr.  Things like WMQ Explorer are the exception because they should not fail over.  If you have a primary and backup QMgr, you typically want WMQ Explorer to see them both at the same time (so for example that you can configure them identically) and if one QMgr is down you want Explorer to report it as such.  Therefore Explorer requires a QMgr name but most apps do not.

It  em appears /em  that I've got everything set up right, but I get no response when I put a message to the associated queue.    
 
 p Here's the EAR file setup:    
 
 pre  code simplemdb.ear 
    META-INF 
        Manifest.mf 
        application.xml 
    simplemdb.jar 
        META-INF

            ejb-jar.xml 
        com 
            [ classes go here ] 
 /code   re  
 
 p I can't find any syntax for defining the queue's JNDI name in ejb-jar.xml, so instead I:    
 
 ul  
 li Define a WebSphere activation spec. Name SimpleMDBActivationSpec, JNDI name jms/SimpleActivationSpec, Destination jms/SimpleMDBQueue. /li  
 li Define a WebSphere queue. Name SimpleMDBQueue, JNDI name jms/SimpleMDBQueue, Queue name SIMPLE.MDB.QUEUE. /li  
 li Define an MQ queue, name SIMPLE.MDB.QUEUE. /li  
 li Deploy the EAR file. During the deployment, I'm asked to enter binding information. I select Activation Specification, then point the Target Resource JNDI Name and Destination JNDI name at the activation spec and queue, respectively. /li  
 /ul  
 
 p (The MDB code has no annotations.) At this point, the app points to the spec and queue, and the spec points to the queue - belt and suspenders. Naturally, I imagine that the app therefore knows about the queue. Full of hope, I put a message on the queue, and ... nothing. The onMessage event is supposed to use System.out to log a message. I see no message.    
 
 p Clear documentation on this is conspicuous by its absence. Google gives LOTS of results, but none of them details how the configuration all fits together. There's lots of hand-waving about ibm-ejb-jar-bnd.xmi, but examples of the file are arcane, full of opaque numbers with no explanation about how they were generated, or how they relate to other parts of the configuration.    
 
 p For goodness' sake. All I want to do is deploy an MDB, and have it write "Hello, world" when I put a message to a queue. I'm using vi and ant as my development and build tools. Can anybody out there give me an idea about what I'm missing?

<value columnNumber="1"> p Some suggestions outside of message delivery tuning since it appears this is not your [primary] bottleneck:    
 
 ul  
 li You mentioned you are storing data into a highly normalized database. This invariably means one or more reference data or PK lookups which creates several additional trips to the database to fetch this data. To avoid or reduce this, create a local cache with all your reference data and update the cache as you go. In memory lookups will be significantly faster than a trip to the DB.  /li  
 li If you feel you have insufficient RAM to cache all your decodes and reference data, shoot for a disk based cache (e.g. EHCache which will do RAM, Disk or Overflow) or a lightweight local DB like HyperSonic or H2 which will still give you better lookup times than a trip to Oracle  (unless you're on the same host, and even then....) /li  
 li Ultimately, if each message requires many round trips to the DB, you may benefit from migrating the processing of the message to the DB itself, where you can implement the process in PL/SQL or Java. /li  
 li If your write to the database for one message processed involves multiple inserts/updates, make sure to use prepared statement batching. This will send multiple inserts/updates in one call to the DB. /li  
 li Speaking of prepared statements, make sure your  a href="http://community.jboss.org/wiki/ConfigDataSources" rel="nofollow" JBoss DataSource configuration /a  for Oracle has  strong prepared-statement-cache-size /strong  set to some number high enough to handle all your prepared statements created during processing (and not the default which is zero, or no caching). /li  
 li The XML parser you are using may be imposing more overhead than is necessary, even (or especially) for small messages. If you are using JAXB, make sure you're not recreating the unmarshaller more than once  (or more than necessary). Alternatively, try a  a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E17802_01/webservices/webservices/docs/1.6/tutorial/doc/SJSXP2.html" rel="nofollow" Pull/Streaming parser /a . If you are using a DOM parser, the additional memory required may be causing a lot of garbage collection. /li  
 li Silly thing, but worth mentioning, if you are executing a lot of logging for each message, that will be costing you time, so turn it off. /li  
 li Using JBoss MQ as an intermediary buffer is elegant but it is probably not the fastest way to store your messages for deferred processing since the persistence is more complex and generalized for all sorts of JMS message types. On that note, if JBoss MQ is persisting to Oracle anyways, then it seems improbable that a custom persistence procedure would not be faster. If JBoss MQ is storing to HyperSonic (as it does by default), you can still probably outperform the store of the JMS message with some custom code. This will also mean that you will need a new mechanism to pull the message back out of the DB for processing, but as with the JMS store, a custom process may outperform the more generalized procedure implemented by JBoss MQ. /li  
 li Storing intermediary messages to the DB may also give more query flexibility to determine where messages do not have to be serially processed. (Perhaps, for example, messages originating from different clients do not need to be processed in sequence). Of course, you can also do this with JBoss MQ by placing the appropriate headers in the intermediary messages. This would allow you to parallelize by using different selectors in multiple different message listeners rocessors. /li  
 /ul  
 
 p One quick item on messaging.....    
 
 p You did not mention if you were using message driven beans with WebSphere MQ, but if you are, there is a setting in the  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.csqzaw.doc/jm40080_.htm?resultof=%22maxPoolDepth%22%20%22maxpooldepth%22%20" rel="nofollow" Inbound Configuration /a  called  strong pollingInterval /strong  which,  to quote from the docs, means:    
 
 p  em If each message listener within a session has no suitable message on its queue, this is the maximum interval, in milliseconds, that elapses before each message listener tries again to get a message from its queue. If it frequently happens that no suitable message is available for any of the message listeners in a session, consider increasing the value of this property. This property is relevant only if TRANSPORT has the value BIND or CLIENT. /em     
 
 p The default  strong pollingTime /strong  is 5000 ms. Your current message processing time is     
 
 blockquote  
   p (3.5 * 60 * 1000 / 2000)    
 /blockquote  
 
 p = 105 ms per message.     
 
 p If you introduce a 5000 ms pause here-and-there, that will seriously cut down on your throughput, so you might want to look into this by measuring the ongoing difference between the message enqueue time and the time that you receive the message in your JBoss message listener. The enqueue time can be determined from these message headers:    
 
 ul  
 li JMS_IBM_PutDate /li  
 li JMS_IBM_PutTime /li  
 /ul  
 
 p All in all, your best bet is going to be to figure out how to parallelize.    
 
 p Good luck.

<value columnNumber="1"> p WebSphere MQ, even on a small server, can unload messages MUCH faster than the rate you describe.  The  a href="http://bit.ly/SupportPacMP7I" rel="nofollow" Windows Performance Report for WMQ V7 /a  tested at more than 2,200 2k persistent round trips (one request and one reply) per second over client channels.  That's more than 4,000 messages per second.    
 
 p The bottleneck in your case would seem to be the latency of processing messages and the dependency on processing the messages in a particular order.  The option that could give you the MOST performance boost would be to eliminate the order dependency.  When I worked at a bank we had a system that posted transactions in the exact order they arrived and everyone said this requirement was mandatory.  However, we eventually revised the system to perform a memo-post during the day and then repost in a later step.  The memo-posting occurred in any order and supported parallelism, failover and all the other benefits of multi-instance processing.  The final post applied the transactions in logical order (and in fact in an order that was most favorable to the customer) once they were all in the DB.  Sequence dependencies lock you into a singleton model and are a worst-case requirement for asynch messaging.  Eliminate them if at all possible.    
 
 p The other area for improvement will be in the parsing and processing of the messages.  As long as you are stuck with sequence dependencies, this is the best bet for improving performance.    
 
 p Finally, you always have the option to throw money at the problem in the form of more memory, CPU, faster disk I/O and so forth.  Essentially this is addressing software architecture with horsepower and is never the best solution but often it buys you enough time to address the root cause.

 p Independently of RTC build i am able to create all sorts of ant scripts and jython scripts to perform automated tasks. The problem is to integrate this into a single RTC build.    
 
 p The path I'm on now is: br  
- RTC build definition calls external build command which is a ms-dos .bat file that call's the Rational Build Utility headless ant with an ant build script. br  
- The ant build script uses 1)projectImport 2)workspaceBuild and 3)exec to call wsadmin with a jython deploy script.    
 
 p Right now the build fails because the workspaceBuild task fails because we've defined a target runtime that does not exist in the headlles ant workspace. If someone knows how to add/define a new target runtime into a headless ant workspace that would be very helpfull.

 p (This project is for an internal company lan, not the internet)    
 
 p We have a WCF webservice which is RESTFUL and sends/receives JSON, it requires NTLM (Kerb would also be good) auth/credentials to ensure that the calling user (from the browser is who they say they are), and this is negotiated between the browser/client and the service by the WCF bindings:    
 
 pre  code    bindings  
    webHttpBinding  
      binding name="webHttpBindingAuth"  
        security mode="TransportCredentialOnly"  
          transport clientCredentialType="Ntlm"  
        /security  
      /binding  
    /webHttpBinding  
  /bindings  
 /code   re  
 
 p Using Fiddler, I can call the methods on the service GET and POST successfully and provided I adjust the JSON we're sending to the webservice (to include the session ID for example) it trundles along happily.    
 
 p The problems started when we tried to use JavaScript/jQuery to call the webservice; the idea is that a web server will supply the HTML/JS to the client browser, the browser should then call the WCF webservice to get a session and allow a user to perform a few actions (we have 3 methods in total).    
 
 p Firstly, we ran into the X-Domain issue, which we tried to resolve by getting the  strong web server /strong  to return the correct headers (Access-Control-Allow-Origin). This didn't prevent browsers like SRIron from telling us that;    
 
 pre  code XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://{webServiceUri}/InstantMessagingService/chat/start/{username}. Origin http://{web**Server**Uri} is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. 
 /code   re  
 
 p Following this, I investigated the possibility of using Silverlight (doesn't seem to support NTLM auth over WebHttpBinding), reverse proxy is out, as the IIS server being used in dev won't be used in prod (I  em believe /em  it is WebSphere, but not under our control); next I looked at this:    
 
 p  a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs aulomorgado/archive/2007/04/27/wcf-building-an-http-user-agent-message-inspector.aspx" rel="nofollow" http://msmvps.com/blogs aulomorgado/archive/2007/04/27/wcf-building-an-http-user-agent-message-inspector.aspx /a     
 
 p Which left me under the impression that the WCF web service was in fact the thing that needed to tell the browser where it was allowed be called from (if that makes sense). Having implemented all the code from the example, I found that the ApplyClientBehavior was never called to attempt to return the headers to the client (monitoring this in Fiddler too). Some more Googling led me to:    
 
 p  a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wcf/thread/707aa031-f4ff-47ab-ba5b-730f7930605e/" rel="nofollow" http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wcf/thread/707aa031-f4ff-47ab-ba5b-730f7930605e/ /a     
 
 p Since we're accessing the web service using jQuery and not some .NET client/service reference roxy/app.. blah, I'm thinking that it's not possible to pre-request-send these headers to allow access to the service. Also, Fiddler seems to think that it's getting a 401 Unauthorized when it does make the attempt to call the  a href="http://../chat/start/" rel="nofollow" http://../chat/start/ /a .. method.    
 
 p Here's the jQuery I'm using to attempt to make the call (I supplied a few settings in the hope it was going to work):    
 
 pre  code var url = webserviceUrl + "chat/start/" + remoteUserUri; 
 
$.ajax({ 
    type: 'GET',    
    url: url, 
    crossDomain: true, 
    beforeSend: function(xhr){ xhr.withCredentials = true; }, 
    contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",                
    success: function (data) { conversationStarted(data); }, 
    dataType: 'json' 
});  
 /code   re  
 
 p Ok, if anyone has helpful hints or ideas, please fire away. I'll reply and edit etc. to make sure this is kept up to date, I hope I haven't missed anything (but my heads spinning a little from my Googling).    
 
 p Also, I know that there might be better ways to do this, but I'd like to do it in the cleanest/quickest way from where I am now - i.e. not a lot of code changes, rewrites etc. I can also post up configs if people think they really are useful.

The full client install includes sample programs in source and object form, utilities, tracing and more.  When you open a trouble ticket with IBM they may ask for information that you would use these tools to gather.  If you do not have the full install you may not be able to provide the requested diagnostic information.  For this reason, IBM  supports the full client installation.  If you are just trying to learn JMS and writing a toy application this is probably OK.

The client supports no transaction and local transaction models."  As noted there it is an SI Bus client not an MQ client, has limited platform support and lacks even single-phase commit.

   p I think it is the opposite - that Play has better performance. Play is using Netty, and not a traditional Java Servlet Container. By that Play is not using the limited architecture with a thread per connection. Play is sometimes compared with Node.js for performance reasons

 p AFAIK all modern servlet containers don't use "limited architecture with a thread per connection". Below is a quote from  a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-02-2009/jw-02-servlet3.html?page=2" rel="nofollow" article /a  on JavaWorld:    
 
 blockquote  
   p Thanks to the non-blocking I/O capability introduced in Java 4's New I/O APIs for the Java Platform (NIO) package, a persistent HTTP connection doesn't require that a thread be constantly attached to it. Threads can be allocated to connections only when requests are being processed. When a connection is idle between requests, the thread can be recycled, and the connection is placed in a centralized NIO select set to detect new requests without consuming a separate thread. This model, called thread per request, potentially allows Web servers to handle a growing number of user connections with a fixed number of threads. With the same hardware configuration, Web servers running in this mode scale much better than in the thread-per-connection mode. Today, popular Web servers -- including Tomcat, Jetty, GlassFish (Grizzly), WebLogic, and WebSphere -- all use thread per request through Java NIO. For application developers, the good news is that Web servers implement non-blocking I/O in a hidden manner, with no exposure whatsoever to applications through servlet APIs.

 p I  em think /em  the issue was the Action header. I believe WCF only support a couple of revisions of WSA, none of which are the one this particular WSDL was using. Looking at the original requests that were failing (pulled out of the WCF Test Client front end) the addressing namespace it was using was declared as:    
 
 pre  code xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2005/05/addressing/none" 
 /code   re  
 
 p Whereas the actual WCF request that goes across to the service is declared as:    
 
 pre  code xmlns:wsa="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/03/addressing" 
 /code   re  
 
 p The actual element itself was populated with the same value, just the difference in namespace:    
 
 pre  code   wsa:Action http://www.nowhere.co.uk/RequestService/RequestOperation  /wsa:Action

<value columnNumber="1"> p I suspect the problem might actually be the opposite of what you are describing.  In older versions of WAS if the  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.express.doc/info/exp/ae/ucli_mqpcf.html" rel="nofollow" User ID field of the Connection Factory panel /a  was left blank, WAS would send a blank ID.  WebSphere MQ would have no value to pass along to the Object Authority Manager and so the channel would run under authority of the Message Channel Agent's process - which is always administrative.  Thus, older versions of WAS commonly ran with administrative rights, although this was not widely recognized as such.  You can verify this by looking at the status of the running channel and see if the MCAUSER field is blank.    
 
 p Newer versions of WAS now try a bit harder to find an ID to send to WMQ if the configuration panel is blank.  Because of this new installations and upgrades of existing installations often fail to authorize to WMQ using the same channel that previously worked.    
 
 p The interesting part of all this is that the only way this is an issue is if the QMgr has a blank value on the MCAUSER channel attribute.  If the QMgr has a blank MCAUSER and no exit is setting MCAUSER at CONNECT time, then the channel allows administrative access.  If the channel does not have SSL with SSLPEER set or an exit to authenticate the connection then that administrative access is available to anonymous users.  Why is this an issue?  Because WebSphere MQ comes with the ability to initiate OS commands based on arrival of a message.  This means that any user with WMQ admin rights can remotely execute arbitrary OS commands  em as a feature of the software /em .  It follows that this capability MUST be locked down, even from legitimate applications if there is to be any accountability of the messages flowing through the network.    
 
 p The fact that your app is able to present an ID that succeeds and another ID that fails would seem to indicate that the QMgr is allowing administrative access and, I would wager, doing so for anonymous connections.  D'oh!  MUCH better to fix the QMgr's security than to fix the connection problem by setting the "right" ID in WAS.

In this mode, applications talk to it using Inter Process Communication (IPC).  This is where two processes on the same server intercommunicate using shared memory, semaphores and other local communication.    
 
 p Eventually the MQ client was created and allowed applications to communicate with WebSphere MQ over the network.  This meant that there were now two modes of communication with the queue manager.  The term Client Mode naturally arose to refer to communications using the MQ client.  The term Bindings Mode arose to differentiate client mode from native WMQ IPC connections.    
 
 p So when you read that an FTE agent uses bindings mode connections, that means that it runs on the same server as a queue manager and that it communicates with the queue manager using shared memory instead of over the network.

 p Finally, it is worth mentioning that Fix Pack 7.0.1.5 has just been released and contains several Java/JMS related fixes.

It is available as a free download at  a href="http://ibm.co/SupptPacMQC7" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MQC7 /a .  Alternatively, you can download the Fix Pack from the  a href="http://ibm.co/oFdVGH" rel="nofollow" Recommended Fixes /a  page.

 p I doubt you will find official documents (from the Tomcat developers/community) to support this theory, although it is very valid. I had to prepare one in my previous job, so that the EAR file of the application could be deployed across multiple J2EE containers.    
 
 p There is one thing in favour though. You can bring up the IBM Redbook titled  a href="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/redp4307.html" rel="nofollow" "WebSphere Application Server V6.1: Classloader Problem Determination" /a  (quite dated, given that WAS 7 is available) which demonstrates how to created shared libraries in WebSphere. On WebSphere, one can create multiple such libraries for applications that require differing versions. On Tomcat, you are the mercy of an administrator who may not know what a class loader is, given that  a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/appdev/deployment.html#Shared_Library_Files" rel="nofollow" all shared libraries is dumped into $CATALINA_HOME\lib /a .    
 
 p The Redbook also has this bit of advice (replace utility file with utility JAR and you have your answer):    
 
 blockquote  
   p  strong Where you should not place utility files /strong     
   
   p In deciding where best to place your 
  utility files, it is important to 
  recognize that these files should not 
  be included in the WebSphere 
  Application Serverâ€™s environment.    
   
   p For example: app_server_root/lib, 
  app_server_root/lib,/ext* , 
  app_server_root/java (including any 
  subdirectories), or the JVM classpath.    
   
   p Adding utility files to those 
  directories can cause problems with 
  the WebSphere runtime environment and 
  can cause unexpected results, 
  including the overwriting of WebSphere 
  classes that can be detrimental to the 
  overall functionality of the server.

 p As for differences, if you want to embed an XSLT 2.0 processor into your own program then Saxon offers a rich API whilst the API AltovaXML offers is limited to transforming input in the form of a string or a file to output in the form of a string or a file.    
 
 p A major shortcoming of AltovaXML in my view is its white space treatment, see the section "Whitespace in XML document" in  a href="http://manual.altova.com/AltovaXML/altovaxmlcommunity/index.html?x20_generalinformation.htm" rel="nofollow" http://manual.altova.com/AltovaXML/altovaxmlcommunity/index.html?x20_generalinformation.htm /a .    
 
 p AltovaXML (the community edition) is the only XSLT 2.0 processor available for "free" that offers schema-aware transformation, so depending on your needs this can be a big plus for AltovaXML.    
 
 p Note that there are also other XSLT 2.0 processors by now, on the .NET platform you have the choice between the .NET version of Saxon and XQSharp, which is a pure .NET implementation of XQuery and XSLT and certainly integrates better with existing Microsoft XML APIs than Saxon does.

 p Lately in one project a discussion came up, about how deal with dependencies/libraries in Tomcat production environments:    
 
 p In my projects I am deploying  strong big WAR files /strong  holding all the required dependencies for the application in WEB-INF/lib folder. The only things I put in the tomcat/lib folder are the JAR files for JDBC connections managed by tomcat.     
 
 p The customer has a long history with WebSphere and thinks the container should hold most of the the required dependencies. So they want to put JAR files for used frameworks or WebService API's (like Metro) in the tomcat/lib folder and have  strong skinny WAR files /strong .    
 
 p The problem with that solution in my opinion is that if you have an application that requires another version of a dependency that is already included in the tomcat/lib folder you can get errors and strange behavior.

 p The jaxen.jar is in my classpath, and the org.jaxen.BaseXPath class is there just fine. Why is Websphere not finding it? It works with all the other libraries I have there. When googling I found  a href="http://fixunix.com/websphere/217283-jdom-problems.html" rel="nofollow" this /a , where someone says that he has a conflicting version somewhere and I should make sure that jars from my web app directory have precedence. In eclise' Built Path Configuration I set Web App Libraries above the WebSphere library (only the src dir is now above the web app libs), but that did not change anything. Unfortunatelly I did not really understand the part about the EAR which seems important...?    
 
 p Update: In the meantime  a href="http://orbeon-forms-ops-users.24843.n4.nabble.com/Odd-issue-deploying-under-Websphere-6-1-013-td39518.html" rel="nofollow" this /a  gave me a new clue. I found on WebSphere's Administration Console the classpath and a list with all jars that are considered by the class loaders. These are quite a number and I searched them with a little grep and unzip -l magic and figured that the file /opt/ibm/WebSphere ortalServer/wcm rereq.wcm/wcm/shared/app/jdom.jar contains jdom (without the jaxen stuff). So maybe this jdom jar is loaded, but jaxen in an incompatible version is loaded from my lib directory?    
 
 p Additionally I found in WebSphere's Administration Console the "parent first/last" setting for my application, but everything is grayed out! I can't switch to parent last :-(.    
 
 p What can I do to find and fix the problem?

 p A JSESSIONID. This is your HTTPSession ID as far as I can tell. 
An LTPA2 token. This is your â€œsingle sign onâ€� session as far as websphere is concerned.    
 
 p Now, IBM say that a single hosted application cannot invalidate the LTPA2 token when a user is signing out. The thinking behind this is that it is an SSO identifier, so a single application should not be able to invalidate it as it is intended for use across multiple applications. There is no configuration in WAS to declare â€œthis environment hosts only one application so therefore that app can invalidate the LTPA2 tokenâ€�.    
 
 p What is worrying is that these LTPA2 sessions hang around for a configurable amount of time. Therefore, if another user got a handle on a usersâ€™ LTPA2 token, they can use it to access that usersâ€™ session and therefore their sensitive data.    
 
 p You can prevent a man in the middle attack to capture the session value by forcing the transmission of the cookie to occur over SSL, and by specifying HTTP only for cookies. However, I am still worried about the cookie being available on the local machinesâ€™ hard drive. The browser has to store it somewhere, so therefore there has got to be a way to get access to it?    
 
 p My question is, is it possible for someone to get an LTPA2 value such as this from the hard drive? Say someone sits down in a library, signs in to their online banking, does some work and then logs out. Is it possible for the next user to get the LTPA2 token somehow?    
 
 p I tried searching through the directories where I thought FireFox 4 and IE8 would store the cookie, but couldnâ€™t pattern match the value. My gut instinct is that it may be possible to find this data on certain browsers?

<value columnNumber="1"> p I had the same question and issues integrating Maven and RAD. I'm using RAD 8 with m2e and trying to automatically deploy/debug portlets for WebSphere Portal 7.    
 
 p First, as to Gorkem's comment:     
 
 blockquote  
   p I am not sure if this works for IBM RAD but with the Eclipse WTP you can define the deployment assembly pieces from the project properties.    
 /blockquote  
 
 p This does work in RAD. I have setup my project's deployment assembly to match the WebSphere build structure and move my Maven Dependencies into the WEB-INF\lib folder (Project -  Properties -  Deployment Assembly -  Add -  Java Build Path Entries -  Maven Dependencies).    
 
 p  img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/50MRe.jpg" alt="enter image description here"     
 
 p This configuration did allow me to build the war successfully and I can export the generated EAR file from RAD and manually deploy it to my local server and it works fine. However, the automatic deploy and 'run on server' options do not work with this alone. For some reason it will deploy all the transitive dependencies (portlet-api, servlet-api, etc) to WebSphere which causes conflicts and explosions.    
 
 p Therefore, I tried the pom solution proposed by McDowell with limited success - it would not compile nor run my tests correctly, though when I removed the tests it did deploy successfully from RAD. I'm working off of his pom to include testing and will post my results here when I get it working.    
 
 p I also found  a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=330202 ;amp;start=0 ;amp;tstart=0" rel="nofollow" this thread /a  which contains a link to a  a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/wikis/download/attachments/113607155/RAD_755_MAVEN_0601.pdf?version=1" rel="nofollow" 2010 IBM document /a  on the "offical" way to integrate Maven and RAD. I'm working through it and will see which solution better meets my needs. Again, if/when I have it working I will post more info here.    
 
 hr  
 
 p Update 11/21/2011    
 
 p IBM has produced an updated document for Maven/RAD integration. You can find it  a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/wikis/download/attachments/113607155/RAD_m2e.pdf?version=1" rel="nofollow" here /a . I have gone through it and it is pretty well-done. It is step-by-step with screenshots and a little bit of background on Maven, M2eclipse, and WTP. There are still a couple annoyances which Chuck describes in the paper, but in the end, it allowed our team to start using Maven in a WebSphere Portal environment without abandoning Maven conventions. Hopefully others will find it useful.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I have a problem with two separate transactions that are flushed to the database in a reverse order to that in which they're actually executed.    
 
 p Here's the business case: there's a RemoteJob-RemoteJobEvent one-to-many relation. Every time a new event is created, a timestamp is obtained and set in the lastModified field of both RemoteJob and RemoteJobEvent, and two records are persisted (one update + one insert).    
 
 p Here's what it looks like in the code:    
 
 pre  code class Main { 
 
@TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRED) 
public void mainMethod(...) { 
  RemoteJob job = remoteJobDAO.findById(...); 
  // ...

  // Here the separate transaction should have ended and its results 
  // permanently visible in the database. We refresh the job then 
  // to update it with the added event: 
  remoteJobDAO.refresh(job); // calls EntityManager.refresh() 
  // ... 
  boolean result = helper.addEventIfNotThere(job); 
} 
 
// Annotation REQUIRES_NEW here to enforce a new transaction; the 
// RemoteJobDAO.newEvent() has REQUIRED.

@TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRES_NEW) 
public boolean addEventIfNotThere(RemoteJob job) { 
  // This loads the job into the persistence context associated with a new transaction. 
  job = remoteJobDAO.findById(job.getId()); 
  // Locking the job record â€“ this method is using as a semaphore by 2 threads, 
  // we need to make sure only one of them completes it. 
  remoteJobDAO.lockJob(job, LockModeType.WRITE); 
  // Refreshing after locking to be certain that we have current data. 
  remoteJobDAO.refresh(job); 
 
  // ... here comes logic for checking if EVENT_CODE_11 is not already there 
  if (/* not yet present */) { 
    remoteJobDAO.newEvent(job, EVENT_CODE_11); 
  } 
 
  return ...; // true - event 11 was there, false - this execution added it. 
} 
 
} 
 /code   re  
 
 p To sum up: in  code mainMethod() /code  we are already in a transaction context. We then hang it to spawn a new transaction to create EVENT_CODE_10 in the method  code addEvent() /code . After this method returns, we should have its results committed and visible for everyone (but the context of  code mainMethod() /code  needs to be refreshed). Finally, we step into the  code addEventIfNotThere() /code  method (a new transaction again), it turns out nobody added the EVENT_CODE_11, so we do it and return. As a result, two events should be in the database.    
 
 p Here's the trouble: OpenJPA seems to flush  strong both /strong  event-adding transactions  strong no sooner than after /strong  the  code addEventIfNotThere() /code  completes! What's more, it does it in a wrong order, and version column values clearly show that the second transaction has no information of the results of the preceding one, even though the first one should have been committed (note the log order, lastModified field values and event codes):

More than likely, if it's a Spring-based application you will face minimal issues redeploying to a different container. If it's a 3rd party application you'll want to check the manual to see any container specific instructions.    
 
 p Take this with a big grain of salt but usually going from Weblogic to WebSphere is less of a hassle than vice versa because Weblogic has less custom 'hooks' and features than WebSphere, for the most part it (Weblogic) just does a really good job of following the JEE spec whereas WebSphere takes a ton of liberties with it.    
 
 p As an example: WebSphere supports Shared Session Context between multiple applications (which is not a part of the JEE spec) and if your apps utilize this they'll probably need some refactoring.

   p Now when the transaction of the EJB timesout, will that cause the infinite loop thread to break or container will stop the thread running the infinte loop.    
 /blockquote  
 
 p This answer is based on reverse-engineering that I performed a couple of years back on OC4J 10.3.x, WebSphere 6.x and WebLogic 10.x, and might apply to other containers in a similar manner. As far as I remember, the transaction timeout detection is implemented differently in different containers, but they all employ certain common principles stated as follows:    
 
 ul  
 li The transaction timeout detection is usually performed in a different thread managed by the container. The pertinent thread sleeps for a specified duration (usually 1 second), then wakes up and iterates through all the transactions in progress. If any transaction has exceeded the timeout specified (usually at various levels - the JTA container, the EJB etc.), then the thread will mark the transaction for rollback. No attempt will be made to signal the thread executing the transaction about the transaction state. /li  
 li When the thread performing the transaction attempts to interact with the JTA co-ordinator or with a transactional resource (an  code XAResource /code  instance) to do some work (for instance, issue a SQL query), the container would determine that the transaction has been marked for a rollback, and would throw a  code TransactionRolledBackException /code . /li  
 /ul  
 
 p Based on the above, it can be inferred that the infinite loop will never be broken unless a  code TransactionRolledBackException /code  is thrown. In other words, the loop will be broken only when a transactional activity is attempted within the loop; if no such activity is performed, then the loop will retain it's property to execute indefinitely.    
 
 p Note that certain containers like WebLogic allow for detection of "stuck" threads. This means that such containers have the ability to detect if a thread has been executing for an extended period of time beyond a configured duration. This done not mean that the container will terminate or interrupt the thread when it detects that one is stuck.

 p What I have noticed is that when the server is built with the install (at least with the newer versions of the products 7.5+), the ports used are different per install. This is to help with not conflicting with other applications that may use those ports.    
 
 p So https is probably fine. You just may have to use it over port 302 or some other port.

 p I am interested in knowing more about the applications installed say, are they up and running? If so, the IP Address, build number, is it in maintenance, etc., (just quoting them as an example)  If I can get all possible details of the application that the MBean could offer, then it would complete my task (partly)    
 
 p The aforementioned is just an example and I would like to get more out of MBeans.  So, please provide a solution / sample code that would help me out in getting information from any MBean the WAS instance has to offer. (Using JMX)    
 
 p Additional Details:

<value columnNumber="1"> p I would say definitions vary. In the generalized context, a Web Server is a server that can receive incoming web-requests and have knowledge about how they should be handled and responded to. Some requests are static (html files, images etc), some are dynamic. In the case of dynamic requests, the web server will know where to route handling of the request, could be a JSP page or a java servlet, a PHP script, a perl CGI script etc etc.    
 
 p While the "web server" in this context executes the dynamic handler, it is not considered to include any supporting middleware features for the dynamic handler.    
 
 p An Application Server, by contrast, is a general execution environment that offers some type of middleware tier support. Examples are EJB containers or the .NET framework built into Windows (in where Windows in itself is an "application server"). There is no inherent requirement that an application-server have anything to do with web requests (although many do), it's just a general execution context and container for any type of application that offers some sort of additional middleware support.    
 
 p In a purely web-centric context, many people will draw the line at static vs dynamic content. In this definition, a "web server" can only handle requests for static information itself and it will pass on requests for dynamic content to the "application server". For example, Apache httpd is a web server and Tomcat is an application server. IIS is a combination of both. In the Java web world, an application server can be either a servlet container (like Tomcat), or a full blown JEE container (like JBoss, WebLogic or WebSphere) that provides the JEE middleware support (EJB) container in addition to the servlet container.

So the 1.6 JRE within IBM WebSphere Application Server V 7.x.x.x will run Java EE code as far back as Java EE 1 (which I think might be Java 1.2 compliant) and should support Java SE code as far back as 1.1. (Why you'd want to go that far back, I'm not sure....).    
 
 p There really is no trouble to it. Just compile your code with a 1.5 JDK (that's what we do), or if you want you could compile it with a 1.6 compiler and flag the compiler to use 1.5.    
 
 p Your code doesn't have to be 1.6 compliant. It just has to be 1.5 compliant and it will run fine. That is the whole point of abstracting and backwards compatibility with the JDK and JRE.    
 
 p As an example for you, we have an enterprise application that we compile with Maven 2 using Sun/Oracle's 1.5 JDK. We package in several open source project jars, some of which are even as old as 1.3 compliant and/or compiled.    
 
 p We package all of this up as an EAR using Maven 2 and we deploy it to IBM's WebSphere Application Server (and we run 7.0.0.9). Our code runs just fine. We even have some modules that we do compile with JDK 1.6 to leverage certain functions in 6, but most of the code is compiled as 1.5. And it runs fine.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I have the following issue: br/  
- A java web application that generate Voice XML - based on struts - deployed on IBM WebSphere AS (WAS v.7.0.0.7). 
 br/ - The application uses Axis2 java - v.1.5 - web service client to invoke a web service resides on WebLogic AS. 
 br/ - I set the timeout to 1000 ms using :    
 
 pre  code stub.getServiceClient().getOptions().setTimeOutInMilliSeconds(1000); 
 /code   re  
 
 p  br/ - The maximum number of times the application hits the web service is about 25,000 per hour - about 7 concurrent calls. 
 br/ - After putting the code that invoke the web service in a try-catch block, i catch the exception and return from the method. 
 br/ - On average, about 200 exceptions are thrown - on WAS - per hour because of the timer expire either in opening the connection or reading the result of the web service invocation 
- By logging    
 
 pre  code exception.getMessage(); 
 /code   re  
 
 p I get either one of the following, mostly the first:    
 
 pre  code org.apache.commons.httpclient.ConnectTimeoutException: The host did not accept the connection within timeout of 60000 ms 
 /code   re  
 
 p or    
 
 pre  code   org.apache.axis2.AxisFault: Read timed out 
 /code   re  
 
 p  br/ - The problem is after a while, the application server hangs, doesn't respond to incoming requests, or respond after a while,which makes us restart the application server, it happened about 3 times in 10 days. 
 br/ - Looking through the logs, I found nothing except the exceptions caught because of the expiry of the timeout, maybe there is something that says more, but i haven't found it yet.    
 
 p  br/ - Are there any guiding points I should consider in the above scenario? is there a clean-up code i could write to release the connection if it wasn't? Can we determine the root cause of the problem from the above description? Is the behavior of the application server "normal"?    
 
 p  br/ I apologize for the long description/question, I always appreciate your help!

 p I'm converting several client web services from JAX-RPC to JAX-WS, and we implement the WS-Security header with a custom username token generator. For JAX-RPC, this is done via a simple wizard, where you create the token and token generator, and it inserts the WSSE information at runtime (using the custom CallbackHandler). For JAX-WS, all the WS-Security wizards require a keystore, and there's no information on just adding the custom CallbackHandler. For JAX-RPC, this configuration was done in the "WS Extension" and "WS Binding" tabs of the deployment descriptor. I've attempted to do it from the Services   Clients in my web project (which lists both RPC and WS services), but again, running into the keystore issue. I've also attempted it from the adminconsole, but it's not working as configured.

I redeploy the portlet application (war or ear depending on how you package it) as I would any application in WAS. Either through the admin console, or using wsadmin.

 p It's basically a CRUD application that lets users view data and manipulate them. It's almost as if it's a replica of the DBMS, only on the web. The code is full of SQL statements everywhere -- in almost each of the servlets in the application.    
 
 p Currently, my manager is asking me to implement some sort of filters for the data.     
 
 p Let's say we have a table  code SomeTable /code :    
 
 pre  code Col1     Col2     Col3     Col4     Col5 
----     ----     ----     ----     ---- 
data2    data3    data4    data5    data6   
 /code   re  
 
 p In the application, if you go to the  code SomeTable /code  page, you get to see the exact same data from the  code SomeTable /code  table, with the one exception that they're displayed in an HTML table. Now, what my manager wants is for the user of the application to be able to filter the data from a different page (let's call this filter page) and then after applying the filters, go back to  code SomeTable /code  page and display the filtered data.    
 
 p In the filter page, they'll be able to choose something like:    
 
 pre  code Col1     =     data2 
Col3   LIKE    %some% 
Col4    IN     1,2,3 
 /code   re  
 
 p These options are all from select boxes. We currently have a functionality like that in one of the pages but it's ugly. SQL statements being passed around session attributes and concatenated with each other on the end. Plus, I can't really re-use them without copying all the code.     
 
 p Someone probably invented something to deal with this and I'm wondering if anyone can give me a advice on how to approach this problem. Is there a framework that I can use or would it be easier to do it just by hand since the application is not really that big.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I'm currently working for a large company who use IBM technologies for a number of internal systems.     
 
 p They're looking to replace their current external facing web application, which was built with ASP.NET WebForms some time ago and definitely needs replacing.    
 
 p At the moment, WebSphere Portal is being touted as the product to build the web application on. As far as I can tell it's useful for intranets or extranets but not for bespoke web applications.    
 
 p A prototype of what the replacement web application might look like has been built already. It's been built purely for the client-side, so has static content. It follows best practice in terms of web standards, accessibility and front-end performance. It achieves this with a mixture of semantic HTML (some HTML5 tags), CSS3 and JS to progressively enhance the site, and OO JS to keep things tidy and well structured and jQuery to manipulate the DOM when appropriate.    
 
 p The company in question has a large customer base that they service via other channels, e.g. telephone and shops as well as via the web channel. They can purchase products and/or services from any of the channels but I guess the important thing is that the same data is available across the channels. This points to some enterprise solution.    
 
 p I understand WebSphere Portal offers a lot out of the box in terms of personalisation and security, and probably fits in well with the nature of the enterprise. I've had a few conversations with architects and developers about Portal but whenever I raise the question about the front-end and its performance it goes in one ear and out of the other.    
 
 p What I don't understand is how much control a web developer has over the interface? Does the sheer divvying up of parts of the site into Portlets stop a decent front-end developer doing his/her job well? Will the well-crafted prototype (if I say so myself) still be well performing after being portalised?    
 
 p How does IBM WebSphere Portal hinder or help the goal of fast, accessible, usable web apps? What are your experiences of WebSphere Portal developers working through this issues and helping front-end devs to provide the best UI they can?    
 
 p  em  strong Clarification and rephrasing of question /em  /strong     
 
 p Based on first answer I have re-phrased the question but I think the points I mentioned above are still valid for setting context.    
 
 p WebSphere Portal offer a number of capabilities that are aimed at the enterprise, like social media capabilities between employees, calendars, news widgets, weather widgets, etc... Not a single out-of-the-box portlet overlaps with the needs of the customer-facing web application.    
 
 p I am having difficulty in understanding the role of Portal if none of its typical intranet-type portlet functionality would be used in the web application.    
 
 p So my worry, which may or may not be founded, is that by using Portal to develop a web application, it will put unnecessary hurdles in the way of controlling the build of the front-end.    
 
 p My understanding of a portal is something like a typical intranet site, or the Yahoo homepage or MSN or NetVibes; a website that allows personalisation, dropping'n'dragging of customisable widgets. Whereas a web application is focused, like a share-dealing web app, online-banking, an e-commerce site, or a betting site, all of which can be logged into and tasks can be carried out. Perhaps these types of web applications could form part of a portal, so, for example, a portal would be a launch-pad into these web applications.    
 
 p I think my question has changed to is WebSphere Portal the right technology to build a web application, based on the definitions I've stated above? And, if not, why not? And vice versa?

 p I'm setting up a build server and the server I have is a RHEL 5.6 server with no Graphical console access (only ssh to a tty console).    
 
 p One of the projects I need to build on the server relies on WAS 6.1 (fix 23, at least), and as the build runs various WAS tools to generate WSDLs, EJBs, etc. I need to have WebSphere installed. So, I downloaded the developers edition, extracted the tar.gz to a directory and tried to install from there.    
 
 p I have read the various documents about the silent install and have done as suggested: created a responsefile (called  code responsefile.txt /code ) with the following    
 
 pre  code -OPT silentInstallLicenseAcceptance="true" 
-OPT allowNonRootSilentInstall="true" 
-OPT installType="installNew" 
-OPT installLocation="/home/me/apps/was/v6.1"

 /code   re  
 
 p When I run the  code WAS/install -silent -options "${PWD}/WAS/responsefile.txt /code , the script seems to run, then returns to the command line after 5 seconds or so. Similarly,  code WAS/install -console -options... /code  does the same.    
 
 p I looked through the install script and added logging to show the various vars in use in the script (to see if there were any unexpected values, nope). The setup.jar  em is /em  in the correct directory, and  code JAVAHOME /code is from the JDK supplied by the WAS installer ( code ${PWD}/JDK/jre.pak/repository ackage.java.jre/java/jre /code ).    
 
 p So, I then ran the java command manually:    
 
 pre  code export JAVAHOME=${PWD}/JDK/jre.pak/repository ackage.java.jre/java/jre 
${JAVAHOME}/bin/java \ 
   -cp ${PWD}/WAS/setup.jar \

   run 
   -silent \ 
   -options "${PWD}/WAS/responsefile.txt"

 p Has anyone succeeded in installing WebSphere from the Linux command line?    
 
 p [Edit] 
OK, seems to be installing now. It turns out there is an environment var you can set to see more output from the installer  code is.debug /code  (needed to decompile  code setup.jar /code  to see this).    
 
 p When I run with this defined, I can at least see the problems it's failing over.    
 
 p Right, in the  code responsefile.txt /code  I needed to remove the  code createProfile /code  option (clashes with  code installType /code ), and disable the OS pre-requisite check by adding  code -OPT disableOSPrereqChecking="true" /code .

 p The other way to create those application associations is in the WebSphere-specific .xmi deployment files. These are created when you deploy but can also be included in WAR/EAR files.

<value columnNumber="1"> p These kind of problems are really tricky, especially when you are under time pressure. This requires systematic problem determination. My guess is that the app has got some error where it is tied to Windows, some hard-coded path perhaps, but that's only a guess you need to work systematically to identify the problem.    
 
 p Your current problem of the .xhtml file being returned directly implies that your application is misconfigured, I guess it's Faces is supposed to interpret that file, so you need to look at how your web.xml is configured.    
 
 p However I would go right back to basics. Application works in Environment 1, not in 2. So what's  the difference? Windows v Linux: plenty of chances for some little feature of you application or WebSphere configuration to be different.    
 
 p Have you got any hard-coded paths in the Application? Look carefully at what you see in the logs when the application starts up in Windows. I guess you'll see Spring and Faces initialise? Now look on Linux, what do you see? Is there a difference?    
 
 p Another approach: get the smallest possible sample Spring/Faces demo app. Does it deploy and run? If not (unlikely) then there's something bad in the WebSphere set up.     
 
 p If it runs then compare with your app, incrementally change it to be your app. You will find a key difference.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I agree with the other response that Spring JMS is simple (providing you know a bit of Spring, and have the framework) but it's quite straightforward from plain old Java too. Just write some code within main to setup a ConnectionFactory, Connection, and Session, e.g. see    
 
 p  a href="http://download.oracle.com/javaee/1.4/tutorial/doc/JMS4.html" rel="nofollow" http://download.oracle.com/javaee/1.4/tutorial/doc/JMS4.html /a     
 
 p you can either look up a ConnectionFactory from JNDI or instantiate a provider-specific one yourself; e.g. for WebSphere MQ you would write something like:    
 
 pre  code MQConnectionFactory cf = new MQConnectionFactory(); 
cf.setHostName(HOSTNAME); 
cf.setPort(PORT); 
cf.setChannel(CHANNEL); 
cf.setTransportType(WMQConstants.WMQ_CM_CLIENT); 
 /code   re  
 
 p (other providers are available, I just can't write the code off the top of my head :) then standard JMS    
 
 pre  code Connection c = cf.createConnection(); 
Session s = c.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE); 
Queue q = s.createQueue("myQueue"); 
MessageConsumer c = s.createConsumer(q); 
 /code   re  
 
 p at this point you have two options. You could create a javax.jms.MessageListener implementation and set it on the MessageConsumer, or if you want more direct control you can either kick off a Thread that uses the MessageConsumer to do either a get-with-wait (receive(int timeout)) or a get with no wait (receiveNoWait()) and then a sleep until the next receive. Don't use receive() though, it's never a good idea with JMS. If you want more than one polling thread then you should check the concurrency restrictions on JMS Session/Consumer objects.     
 
 p Don't forget to call Connection.start() once the setup is done if you want anything to happen    
 
 p Advantages are you only need your JMS provider .jars on the classpath, no framework etc. Disadvantages are that it's more complex than Spring, which provides quite an elegant solution to this - note how much setup code there is here, compared to Spring which abstracts it all out. Really depends on your preferences, other requirements etc.

 p  strong Edit #1 /strong     
 
 p On some reflection I realised that the problem occured after an unrelated change. On a hunch I fully uninstalled the application from WAS and then reinstalled it. The problem was gone. The problem recurred after the next application  em update /em  (i.e. overwrite).    
 
 p After several more hours, and other changes unlreated to Scala XML parsing, I forgot to uninstall/reinstall and did an update instead. The problem did not recur. I can no longer replicate the issue.    
 
 p  strong Edit #2 /strong     
 
 p The problem came back and can not be solved with uninstall/reinstall alone. Retried with Scala 2.8.1, but the problem persists. Will now try uninstall/turn off server/delete temp files/reinstall/restart server. Wish me luck.

<value columnNumber="1"> p The issue here is the requirement that "My boss asked me to use pure java JMS (not ibm.mq lib) to do that."  JMS is a specification and each implementation must comply with the API and the semantics, but is free to do whatever they want at a low level.  It is always necessary to use the implementation classes provided by the transport vendor.  Therefore if you use WebSphere MQ as the transport, you will need to use the IBM MQ JMS classes to write a JMS application.    
 
 p That said, if you stick with pure JMS API calls you would be able to plug in any transport vendor's classes.  This is what is usually intended when you are given requirements such as that mentioned in the original post.    
 
 p There's an article describing exactly what you are looking to do called  em  a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/0610_woolf/0610_woolf.html" rel="nofollow" Running a standalone Java application on WebSphere MQ V6.0 /a  /em   It uses only the JMS API and it uses JNDI in a local file system (a .bindings file).  By swapping out the IBM JMS classes for another vendor and using their JNDI tools you would be able to plug in any JMS transport without changing your code using this approach.    
 
 p If you want to do the same thing without JNDI, look at the sample programs provided with the MQ client install where you obtained your Java classes.  In a UNIX/Linux system these are in  code /opt/mqm/samp /code  and on Windows they are in  code install_dir/tools/jms/samples /code . The  code SimpleRequestor.java /code  sample has the following code for initializing your connection factory without JNDI:    
 
 pre  code try { 
  // Create a connection factory 
  JmsFactoryFactory ff = JmsFactoryFactory.getInstance(WMQConstants.WMQ_PROVIDER); 
  JmsConnectionFactory cf = ff.createConnectionFactory(); 
 
  // Set the properties 
  cf.setStringProperty(WMQConstants.WMQ_HOST_NAME, "localhost"); 
  cf.setIntProperty(WMQConstants.WMQ_PORT, 1414); 
  cf.setStringProperty(WMQConstants.WMQ_CHANNEL, "SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN"); 
  cf.setIntProperty(WMQConstants.WMQ_CONNECTION_MODE, WMQConstants.WMQ_CM_CLIENT); 
  cf.setStringProperty(WMQConstants.WMQ_QUEUE_MANAGER, "QM1"); 
 /code   re  
 
 p Because this approach does not use JNDI, you are required to write code that is not transportable across transport vendors.  It is IBM WebSphere MQ specific.    
 
 p If you grabbed the MQ jars from somewhere and do not have the full install (and thus do not have the samples) you can download it as  a href="http://bit.ly/SupportPacMQC7" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MQC7 /a .  The download is free.  In general you should use the latest client, even with a back-level queue manager.  Obviously you do not get V7 functionality from a V6 QMgr but the JMS implementation in the V7 client is much improved, even for V6 functionality.  If for some reason you really must use the V6 client, you can download it as  a href="http://bit.ly/SupportPacMQC6" rel="nofollow" SupportPacMQC6 /a .  Whichever client version you use, make sure to use the corresponding Infocenter.

 p I've never seen this particular error, but then I don't work with BEA or SQL Server, but a quick google does show other folks suggesting such a cause.    
 
 p When you're using a connection pool, if you do get such a glitch, then all connections in teh pool become "stale" or invalid. My application server (WebSphere) has the option to discard the entire connection pool after particular errors are detected. The result then is that one unlucky request sees the error, but then subsequent requests get a new connection and recover. If you don't discard the whole pool then you get a failure as each stale connection is used and discarded.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I had the same problem a while ago with a WebSphere. We were deploying an application that needed to access other applications via TLS with client authentication. So our first thought was to reuse the server TSL certificate for the purpose. There was no way to do it other than specifying the path to the key store resource. I think the WebSphere documentation explanation was something along the lines of "separation of concerns" - the SSL/TLS key store was only meant to be used for authenticating the server for connections made to it - not for anything else.    
 
 p The argument is quite valid if you consider the Key Usage/Extended Key Usage fields and Distinguished Name of such a "server certificate". The DN is the server host name (used for host name verification) and the Extended Key Usage is "server authentication" most of the time.    
 
 p Although your intention would still be valid if the certificate would additionally feature a "client authentication" Extended Key Usage (it did in our case). If it does then IMO it would be valid to re-use the certificate for that purpose.    
 
 p But the best argument I heard in the discussion was this: the production servers were maintained by a different group of people than the actual app developers. If the app devs wanted to reuse the server key store file, then the server maintainers would have to tell them the password or at least grant read permissions to the application for for reading the file containing the key store password. Both was unacceptable for their security policies.

the command "sed -i ' rc_auto_restart/d' tmp-was-restart.sh" execute correct,and it stoped at "/wasdata/scripts/systeminf/tmp-was-restart.sh", I alse try source/execute method,both not work,  after i kill the process 29983 ,the command "/wasdata/scripts/systeminf/tmp-was-restart.sh" executed, but the "cat /dev/null /wasdata/scripts/systeminf/tmp-was-restart.sh" not executed,  very confused!!!

 p We have an application that is running on WAS. When we start the server, WAS sets his DataSource so that it points to the data base. Everything works fine, expect when the DBAs have to reboot the data base server. When they do, the data source is no longer valid and we have to manually restart all server and we are currently trying to correct that, if possible. We need to find a way to do it because we have 3 pre-production environnement for for our application, and there are two servers associated with it, one for the application and the other is a report generator web service. So, when the DBAs wants to reboot the server (and they usually don't tell us!) we have to reboot six servers. I was wondering if in Java, there was a way to reset the data source so that we don't need to restart the servers.

If not (yeah, I'm looking at you, WebSphere MQ), what I usually do is push the message into another JMS queue reserved for temporarily unprocessable messages and commit. When the MIA resource comes back on line, I procedurally read all the messages off that queue and write them back to the main [original] queue where they're processed to completion.    
 
 ul  
 li The message is invalid /li

 p Suppress the exception and commit the transaction. You'll never see that message again. To keep an audit trail of invalid messages:    
 
 ul

 li Log out the contents of the message /li

 p Meaning, it could do any number of things, including nothing.    
 
 p As for the question, a lot of application servers call the System.gc() here and there. WebSphere is a prime offender and you can find it all over the WAS ortal codebase. Haven't seen it in open-source libraries/frameworks that I can remember. Possibly the people who make the effort to contribute to these frameworks have enough sense to not use operations with undefinable behavior.    
 
 p My guess is that it's being invoked at times when the developer felt that "this operation may, under some circumstances, use a lot of "temporary" (short-lived) memory in processing, so I'll do some garbage collection to reclaim it". This is probably the case for your RMI scenario as well. In my opinion, it's bogus. In some cases, calling System.gc() can LOWER performance by triggering full GC cycles prematurely (and unnecessarily). Point being, the garbage collector is pretty smart and unless you're certain you know better, don't try to mess with it.

 p JAX-RS is a standard that makes it easy to create a RESTful service that can be deployed to any Java application server:  GlassFish, WebLogic, WebSphere, JBoss, etc.    
 
 p JAX-RS is part of Java EE, and when JAX-RS is used with other Java EE technologies it becomes even easier to create your RESTful service:    
 
 ul  
 li  strong EJB /strong  - A session bean is used as the service implementation and also handles the transaction semantics. /li  
 li  strong JAX-RS /strong  - Used to expose the session bean as a RESTful service /li  
 li  strong JPA /strong  - Used to persist the POJOs to the database.  Note how the EntityManager is injected onto the session bean. /li

In addition, JMS allows hints to suppress message timestamp and message id, which may help reduce message size e.g.

<value columnNumber="1"> p IBM Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software (RAD) is a commercial Eclipse-based integrated development environment (IDE), made by IBM's Rational Software division, for visually designing, constructing, testing, and deploying Web services, portals, and Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) applications.    
 
 p  strong Overview /strong     
 
 p Rational Application Developer is an integrated development environment that helps Java software developers design, develop, and deploy their applications. It contains specialized wizards, editors, and validators for a variety of technologies:    
 
 ul  
 li  p Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE): This architecture is used to build distributed Web and enterprise applications. Java EE applications include: Enterprise Java beans (EJB) applications for distributed, secure applications with transactional support, Java Persistence API (JPA) applications to access persistent data, and JavaServer Pages (JSP) or JavaServer Faces (JSF) for developing presentation logic.    /li  
 li  p Web services: A Web service is a self-contained, self-describing, modular application that can be published, located, and invoked across the Internet. Web service tools enable software developers to discover existing Web services for integration, create Web services from existing artifacts or from Web Services Description Language (WSDL) files, and to deploy Web services to a variety of environments.    /li  
 li  p Service Component Architecture (SCA): SCA enables software reuse by assembling a set of services into a composite application. SCA development tools provide graphical wiring of components to form composite services, associate protocol bindings and quality of service intents to SCA components, and package SCA assets for deployment.    /li  
 li  p Extensible Markup Language (XML): XML is a generic language that can be used to describe any kind of content in a structured way. XML is used extensively to create Web services. XML tools include DTD, XSL, schema, and mapping editors.    /li  
 li  p Java EE Connector (J2C): J2C tools enable applications to access operations and data on enterprise information systems such as CICS or IMS. Wizards assist with file importing, data mapping, and the creation of Java classes and methods to access data.    /li  
 li  p Web application: Web applications range from Web sites, to complex applications that use JSF to access data, or Rich Internet applications that use Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Ajax). The workbench includes wizards, editors, and palettes to assist with the creation and deployment of Web applications.    /li  
 /ul  
 
 p Rational Application Developer includes tools to improve code quality. A Java profiling tool helps to analyze an application's performance, memory usage, and threading problems. A software analysis tool identifies patterns and antipatterns in application code, and compares code to coding standards.    
 
 p To manage source code, a development team can configure Rational Application Developer to work with a source code repository system. The product ships with connectors to IBM Rational ClearCase for source control and IBM Rational ClearQuest for defect management. It also ships with a Rational Team Concert client that can be used for both source control and defect management.    
 
 p The workbench includes tools for deploying an application to a local or remote server. It contains test environments for IBM WebSphere Application Server and IBM WebSphere Portal. It also supports Apache Tomcat. Using these tools, a software developer can test their application locally before publishing it to a production server.

<value columnNumber="1"> p In JBoss AS 7, is there a way to interactively deploy an application? In other words, rather than manually creating JBoss deployment descriptors prior to deployment (e.g. jboss-web.xml), is there a way for JBoss to  em prompt /em  the deployer for information that it needs in order to successfully deploy and/or is there an API that can be invoked programmatically or via scripting to do this? For example, if an application defines a resource reference or environment entry which is annotated in the code ( code @Resource /code ), how is a deployer to know that this resource reference must be bound at deployment-time?    
 
 p For some background, I've been using IBM WebSphere Application Server as my primary Java EE application server and it provides Java APIs, wsadmin commands, and a GUI wizard in the admin console which prompt deployers for the deployment information that it needs to deploy an application and generates its own custom descriptor files during deployment. I'm hoping that other application servers, in particular, JBoss 7, also provide similar functionality.    
 
 p One of the goals is to be able to  em automate /em  the deployment of a diverse set of portable Java EE applications (i.e. applications that will not have JBoss-specific descriptors containing deployment information), and to prevent deployers  em manually /em  performing deployments from being intimately familiar not only with the application and module deployment descriptors, but more importantly, all of the annotations contained in the code that must be managed at deployment-time (such as  code @Resource /code  annotations).    
 
 p In particular, I'm looking for the fulfillment of this requirement in the  a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=316" rel="nofollow" Java EE specification /a :    
 
 blockquote  
   p  strong EE.2.12.4 Deployment Descriptors and Annotations /strong     
   
   p The Java EE Product Provider is required to provide a deployment tool that interprets the Java EE deployment descriptors and class file annotations and allows the Deployer to map the application componentâ€™s requirements to the capabilities of a specific Java EE product and environment.    
 /blockquote  
 
 p While the specification is somewhat ambiguous as to what this means and how it is implemented, in my opinion, WebSphere Application Server fulfills this requirement beautifully, whereas many other application servers (such as JBoss, it seems) that require the manual creation of custom descriptors prior to deployment fall short.    
 
 p Also note that I've posted this same question to the JBoss Community Forums ( a href="http://community.jboss.org/message/621309#621309" rel="nofollow" here /a  and  a href="http://community.jboss.org/thread/171141" rel="nofollow" here /a ), but have not received any responses there.

 p  em  strong [UPDATE] /em  /strong  It seems this problem is likely related to JBoss 7's new isolated, modular class loading policies. I found two workarounds/solutions to this problem, but I'm still interested in suggestions on the most appropriate, recommended approach, particularly if there is a way that we can avoid manual modifications to our applications or JBoss installations.    
 
 p  strong MANIFEST.MF /strong     
 
 ul  
 li  p Create a  code com.sun.jndi.dns /code  module, by copying  code $JBOSS_HOME/modules/com/sun/jndi/ldap /code  to  code $JBOSS_HOME/modules/com/sun/jndi/dns /code  and modify occurrences of "ldap" to "dns"    /li  
 li  p Add the following entry to the web module's  code MANIFEST.MF /code :  code Dependencies: com.sun.jndi.dns /code     /li  
 /ul  
 
 p Although this now allows the DnsContextFactory to instantiate properly, this doesn't seem to be a permanent solution since it requires modification of all JBoss installations as well as all applications that use the DnsContextFactory.    
 
 p  strong jboss-deployment-structure.xml /strong     
 
 ul  
 li  p Add a  code jboss-deployment-structure.xml /code  file to the EAR's  code META-INF /code  directory, as follows:    
 
 p     
 
 pre  code   sub-deployment name="test-web.war"  
      dependencies  
          module name="deployment.com.sun.jndi.dns"   
      /dependencies  
  /sub-deployment  
 
  module name="deployment.com.sun.jndi.dns"  
      dependencies  
          module name="system" export="false"  
              exports  
                  include-set  
                      path name="com/sun/jndi/dns"  
                  /include-set  
              /exports  
          /module  
      /dependencies  
  /module  
 /code   re  
 
 p     /li  
 /ul  
 
 p This is slightly better than the previous "MANIFEST.MF" approach, since it only requires modification to the application, and not also the JBoss modules, but is unfortunate that all applications that use the DnsContextFactory must include this configuration.    
 
 p I'm still looking for suggestions on the most appropriate, recommended approach, particularly if there is a way that we can avoid including more JBoss-specific configuration in our applications.

Also why JDBC configuration comes out valid but if you add anything JMS related, it makes the configuration invalid?

<value columnNumber="1"> p Well, here are some thoughts    
 
 ul  
 li Have the log files exposed as read only. Make them available on 
request, or serve them up via HTTP to a page so developers can get at 
them when they need them. If you make sure you don't log customer 
information to the logs, that makes it easier to get this agreed 
upon. /li  
 li Personally I don't think it is a bad thing to allow developers read 
only access to the application server console screens (for example a 
WebSphere Application Server). This way, you can view settings. 
Passwords and things should be hidden anyway, so it isn't like you 
can steal secrets. Plus, by view only, you can see if something is 
amiss, and always request higher up sysadmins to make the changes 
needed. /li  
 li If your company has the time to do it, it would be worth classifying 
your data. What is customer-based? What is data that may be the 
"secret" to how your company does business versus other competitors. 
If you classify your data, you can now better define who can have 
what access to what. Even in production, the DBA's could set up some 
developer user ids that allow you select (read) access on the 
classifications of data that are ok to look at. Anything that needs a 
clearance, you may have to go to the DBA for, but...you can at least 
query for some things without needing the whole "war room" to do so. /li  
 li If you afford to build and maintain it, have a mirror of production 
somewhere. This mirror is configured exactly the same as production. 
It has the most recently deployed version of the application there. 
And if you need production data, you take a back up of the data from 
production, run it through a "scrubber" or "scrambler" if you need to 
so satisfy your execs, and the upload it to this mirror. Voila! You 
now have as close to production as possible, but you are allowed to 
have more authority in this environment to troubleshoot. This will 
give you everything except exact production data (since it was 
scrambled). If the bug turns out to be something along the lines of 
specific data, then you go back to querying production and/or working 
with the DBA on it. /li  
 li Also, perhaps it would be worthwhile to have some profiles on 
standby? Perhaps your sysadmins could grant you some temporary 
authorities to things? This could be argued as good or bad either way 
and is ultimately a company policy. /li  
 li Also having a good change management system in place goes a long way 
to identifying candidates for what just went wrong. If your 
application suddenly crashes, it would be helpful to know that the 
sysadmins just applied an OS patch to production and this OS patch 
may in fact be affecting your application. Or maybe somebody else 
moved a fix to production and didn't fully test it. But you at least 
know what could be potential candidates for breaking things. /li  
 /ul  
 
 p Ultimately, all of these things or others, are things that your company and your IS/IT department need to decide. Perhaps this is something to discuss with your CIO? Or your manager? (Of course it depends on how well they accept feedback and comments. Where I work, I'm very lucky that they appreciate those kinds of thoughts from us.) Perhaps, now is the time to begin to discuss these things.    
 
 p Also it doesn't hurt to present the cost of the risks versus the benefits. If a temporary grant of authority to the logs, the db, etc. gets you "up" in production, perhaps that risk, is outweighed by the satisfaction felt by your customers, both internal and external.    
 
 p Anyway, just some thoughts to think about. I'm not sure if there is a right or wrong here. It is just something every company has to make their own and then live with their choices. But kudos to you for getting the ball rolling on this conversation.

<value columnNumber="1"> p Most Java web applications that I've worked with, or studied, have been typically published as Enterprise or Web archives. The case for RPMs is quite weak, except for very specific scenarios.    
 
 p There are several points that go in favor of EAR/WAR files:    
 
 ul  
 li  p Installation is often easy, even if it involves some manual process of copying/uploading EAR/WAR files to a designated directory. However, you need to know your target audience here. If you are expecting that a Linux system administrator (who has little or no knowledge of Java application servers) is performing the installation and maintenance of the application, then you might right in choosing RPMs. This is however a rare case for businesses, for it makes less sense from the point of view of support; you simply do not want to be at the mercy of a third-party application developer when installation/configuration issues are encountered in the production.    /li  
 li  p EAR/WAR files can be published in a manner that can allow for portable installations. It is theoretically possible to support multiple containers with a single build. This is a far better alternative than requiring a RPM to be published per-container; each RPM would have to install an application-specific container and publish the EAR/WAR file to this embedded container. If you wish to have your customers retain the choice of deploying onto their own containers, a RPM-only deployment model will require them to extract the EAR/WAR file from the RPM, and then perform the deploy themselves.    /li  
 li  p RPMs cannot be used to deploy applications in a standard manner, across commercial containers like WebLogic, WebSphere etc. It simply cannot be done, unless you expect your customers to employ a standard installation model involving directory layouts, clustering modes etc. RPMs that are created in-house to target a single customer, might not have this problem, as internal standards can be established on how the containers would be installed and configured.    /li  
 /ul  
 
 p Inferring from the above statements, EAR/WAR files ought to be available always to account for customer needs, with the added possibility of having RPMs for a hassle-free installation.

<value columnNumber="1"> p First, I'll start with a summary.  I'm using an Apache CXF client to communicate over SSL with an Apache CXF service provider that is using a self-signed certificate.  I imported the certificate into the WebSphere truststore on the client server, but I still receive a "javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: SSLHandshakeException invoking  a href="https://somesvcprovider.com/appname/svc/myservice" rel="nofollow" https://somesvcprovider.com/appname/svc/myservice /a : com.ibm.jsse2.util.h: No trusted certificate found" exception.    
 
 p Now, here's the details:    
 
 p I have an Apache CXF web service client that I am configuring using Spring, and the client is deployed to a WebSphere 6.1 application server.  The CXF client communicates with an Apache CXF service provider on a different WebSphere server.  The communication uses SSL.    
 
 p The service provider is using a self-signed certificate.  I've imported the provider's certificate into the WebSphere truststore on the client server through the administrative console.  I accomplished this by going to SSL certificate and key management   SSL configurations   NodeDefaultSSLSettings   Key stores and certificates   NodeDefaultTrustStore   Signer certificates; then I used the "Retrieve from port" tool to import the certificate.    
 
 p However, I still receive this error when attempting to contact the service provider:  "javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: SSLHandshakeException invoking  a href="https://somesvcprovider.com/appname/svc/myservice" rel="nofollow" https://somesvcprovider.com/appname/svc/myservice /a : com.ibm.jsse2.util.h: No trusted certificate found".

 p Also, I don't know if this is related, but no trust managers are returned when I inspect the TLSClientParameters object on the CXF client at runtime.  The code to do the inspection is below:    
 
 pre  code // Get the trust managers for this client.

 p No, as said, EJB is part of Java EE. Spring is a standalone framework which extends and improves parts of Java EE. Spring doesn't necessarily require Java EE to run. Back during the old J2EE/EJB2 times, the EJB2 API was terrible to implement and maintain. Spring was then a much better alternative to EJB2. But since EJB3 (Java EE 5/6), the EJB API was much improved based on lessons learnt from Spring. Now with Java EE 6 which comes with very nice EJB 3.1 and CDI there's not really a reason to look at again  em another /em  framework like Spring to make the developers more easy.

<value columnNumber="1"> p An exit is a point in the vendor code that calls out to user or 3rd party code to perform custom functions.  WebSphere MQ provides security exit points at both the server and at the client.  A common use for a security exit is that after authenticating the connection, the exit sets the MCAUSER field in the channel to the user ID that was resolved in the authentication.  Authorization is performed against this value.    
 
 p A stand-alone server-side exit can authenticate connections based on data passed in the connection request.  The most common items used by a server-side exit are SSL certificate details, user credentials passed from the client and IP connection information.    
 
 p A client/server exit pair can do any arbitrarily complex authentication.  For example, the client-side exit can prompt the user for ID and password, encrypt these and then forward to the server-side exit for validation.  There is an SSPI exit pair supplied with the Windows version of WMQ that authenticates using Kerberos tokens.    
 
 p Server-side exits must be written in C.  In v6.0 and prior versions of WebSphere MQ you were required to write channel exits in C as well.  As of v7 it is possible to write channel exits in Java as described in the documentation  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.csqzaw.doc/jm11171_.htm" here /a .  Note that client channel exits are most useful when paired with a server-side exit.  For example, it would not do much good for a client channel exit to supply authentication credentials if there is no server-side exit to do something with them.    
 
 p Additional information on exits is available in the  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.csqzae.doc/ic17440_.htm" Intercommunications manual /a . br

We are using Rational Software Development Platform V6 with WebSphere V5.1 to run our application. We work with a CVS to share the sources. The application generates a PDF report and ZIPs it, then it puts it in the data base (Oracle 9i) in a BLOB field. Up until now, everything works fine. With RAD, we use the ojdbc14.jar to connect the data base (we've been using it since forever...). So, that being said, when we run the application locally, the following line raises an exception:    
 
 pre  code tempBlob = BLOB.createTemporary(cnn, true, BLOB.DURATION_SESSION); 
 /code   re  
 
 p The exception is an SQLException saying invalid argument(s) in call. Looking at this, I don't see which argument might be wrong, since the data base access is centralized and the object cnn is OracleConnection type, that is retreive with the same function we use all over the application. SO, I tryied using ByteInputStream to set the parameter of the prepared statement using setByteStream. The value of my byte array is ok, it contains something like 2 MO. When I execute the query, it says 1 row update. There is a field in the data base call finished_time that is successfully updated and the other field, the report field, is null....    
 
 p If I go back to the createTemportary function, we worked 3 developers for a day to trouble shoot the problem, an we found nothing wrong... So, I decided to migrate the code on the DEV server. I commit the changes, create a totally new workspace, checked out and run an Ant build, that builds, sent through FTP the WAR and deploys it on the WebSphere server. Then I try the report generation and the DB is successfully update. The function createTemporary doen't raise any exception, but locally. The problem is, no one of us can do that locally!?!

<value columnNumber="1"> p I'm having a project using JSF2 (2.1.2), Richfaces4 (4.0.0.Final) on tomcat6 (6.0.28). In order to manage portability between Tomcat and WebSphere7 for my EARs, I have the following jars inside my tomcat lib: el-api-2.2.jar, jsf-api-2.1.2.jar, jsf-impl-2.1.2.jar, validation-api-1.0.0.GA.jar.    
 
 p My problem is that I never managed to change the log levels of JSF or Richfaces and except from the initialization ones, I don't see any inside my console. Even when I get exceptions in my server response !    
 
 p I tried several ways:    
 
 p 1) Inside my applications, I'm using slf4j and log4j. So the natural way would be to use SLF4JBridgeHandler.install(). I made a small servlet to call this method during its init() method and added a 'load-on-startup' to be sure it's loaded before JSF Servlet (I'm not sure tomcat cares at all about this load-on-startup directive because I still get logs from JSF init before), e.g.:    
 
 pre  code INFO: JSF1027 : [null] Les objets ELResolvers de JSF nâ€™ont pas Ã©tÃ© enregistrÃ©s avec le conteneur JSP. 
09-09-2011 16:50:58:591 [Thread-2] 937  DEBUG com.jsf.test.SLF4JBridgeHandlerInstallerServlet - SLF4JBridgeHandler.install() OK! 
 /code   re  
 
 p I also added some configuration in my log4j.xml:    
 
 pre  code   logger name="javax.faces"   level value="debug"   /logger    
  logger name="com.sun.faces"   level value="debug"   /logger  
  logger name="javax.enterprise.resource.webcontainer.jsf"   level value="debug"   /logger  
 /code   re  
 
 p But I don't see any logs in my console when displaying a JSF page... 
I also tried using a filter to call SLF4JBridgeHandler.install() before the execution of the JSF Servlet, but I only get a lot of OK logs from my filter...    
 
 p 2) I tried to follow the tutorial  a href="http://java-tutorial.ch/java-server-faces/jsf-2-logging-with-tomcat" rel="nofollow" here /a  exactly (it creates new files in tomcat log folder for each logger of JSF2). I tried by changing the logging.properties inside the conf folder of tomcat and by adding a new logging.properties inside my src/resources/ folder in my application. But no luck...    
 
 p 3) I tried to add the JSF loggers to the the logging.properties inside my tomcat by adding this:    
 
 pre  code javax.enterprise.resource.webcontainer.jsf.managedbean.level=FINEST 
javax.enterprise.resource.webcontainer.jsf.managedbean.handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler 
javax.enterprise.resource.webcontainer.jsf.config.level=FINEST 
javax.enterprise.resource.webcontainer.jsf.config.handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler 
javax.enterprise.resource.webcontainer.jsf.facelets.level=FINEST 
javax.enterprise.resource.webcontainer.jsf.facelets.handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler 
javax.enterprise.resource.webcontainer.jsf.resource.level=FINEST 
javax.enterprise.resource.webcontainer.jsf.resource.handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler 
javax.enterprise.resource.webcontainer.jsf.lifecycle.level=FINEST 
javax.enterprise.resource.webcontainer.jsf.lifecycle.handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler 
 /code   re  
 
 p No luck yet...    
 
 p 4) I tried to use log4j inside tomcat instead of juli by following  a href="http://mrhaki.blogspot.com/2011/02/configure-log4j-on-tomcat.html" rel="nofollow" this documentation /a . It seems to work well, but changing the resulting log4j.properties to put the JSF loggers in DEBUG didn't work...    
 
 p Any idea ?

Since connectors gets loaded into the container classloader hierarchy, the log4j lib in the connector effectively overrode the log4j in our application. It also prevented our own log4j properties from being loaded, since log4j was already bootstrapped.    
 
 p It would be that you, also, have some other library or resource loaded in your WAS stack that comes with log4j. The way we got around it was doing explicit log4j initialization (reading the log4j properties) programatically in our application.

There is however the ability to bundle libraries within a Java EE application, so that multiple modules (including web-modules residing in WARs) can load and access classes in the bundled libraries.    
 
 p The Java EE specification allows an Enterprise application deployment (a  code .ear /code  file) to bundle libraries in a library deployment directory; by default this is the  code lib /code  directory within a  code .ear /code  file. These libraries may then be used by multiple web-modules (located in different  code .war /code  files) within the root of the  code .ear /code  file. The relevant part of the Java EE 6 specification is Section EE 8.2.1, where the following is stated:    
 
 blockquote  
   p A  code .ear /code  file may contain a directory that contains libraries packaged in JAR files. The  code library-directory /code  element of the  code .ear /code  fileâ€™s deployment descriptor contains the name of this directory. If a  code library-directory /code  element isnâ€™t specified, or if the  code .ear /code  file does not contain a deployment descriptor, the directory named  code lib /code  is used. An empty  code library-directory /code  element may be used to specify that there is no library directory.    
   
   p All files in this directory (but not subdirectories) with a  code .jar /code  extension must be made available to all components packaged in the EAR file, including application clients. These libraries may reference other libraries, either bundled with the application or installed separately, using any of the techniques described herein.    
 /blockquote  
 
 p It is important to note that all Java EE compliant application servers (WebLogic/WebSphere/JBoss et al) will support deployment of EAR files with bundled libraries. However, there are servlet containers (like Tomcat and Jetty) which do not comply with the entire Java EE specification; such containers will not support deployment of EAR files.    
 
 p In the event where the libraries are required to be accessed by multiple web modules in a servlet container (either due to the choice of the container or due to a preference for WAR files), you ought to rely on the servlet container support for shared libraries to deploy the WAR files without the libraries. The Java EE specification does not mandate any requirement in this area concerning the use of installed libraries. Some containers support shared libraries better than others, by supporting versioned shared libraries (where deployed applications may use only one version among several), while others (like Tomcat) do not.

 p If you are staying pure Java, it's pretty trivial these days to turn a POJO into a remotely callable EJB: just a couple of annotations.    
 
 p It may sound like overkill, but in terms of effort and cost (given a free app server such as WebSphere CE or JBoss) it's not that big a deal. However if you don't go for EJBs then you need to look at two big issues:    
 
 ol  
 li Security. You've got some TCP-callable services. How sensitive are those services? Do they need authentication and authorisation? You can all too easily open up sensitive databases to the whole company or even the internet. /li  
 li Resilience and Scaling. How will you manage failure scenarios? EJBs exposed via RMI/IIOP can be clusterd and hence you can scale and deal with errors. If you start with a technology capable of doing that, even if you don't need the functionality right now, you are well placed for the future. /li

<value columnNumber="1"> p A very odd issue turned up for us when we recently added a new node to our WebSphere Portal/WCM 6.1.5.2 cluster.    
 
 p Our application makes use of the inline authoring functionality in the local rendering portlet. The setup is fairly standard. We have a menu component we use to display content from a site-area. In the component, we have an authoring tool reference for each content item like so:    
 
 pre  code   Component name="admin library/editauthoringtool" compute="always"  
 /code   re  
 
 p The "editauthoringtool" is a standard "Authoring tools" component with edit action    
 
 pre  code   a href="  Placeholder tag="href" "  class="icon-edit" title="Edit"   /a  
 /code   re  
 
 p Now for the odd bit. When viewing a page using these components on one of our server, a correct inline authoring url link is rendered with an href containing a javascript call to the auto-generated  code ..._openInlineEditingDialog() /code  method - looking something like this:    
 
 pre  code   a title="Edit" class="icon-edit" href="javascript:ns_7_CES00SD30GCN80I6UTMJF50MO2_openInlineEditingDialog('?uri=dialog%3awcm ;amp;amp;docid=com.aptrix.pluto.content.Content%2f8e87e6804822e81a832a973e18750505 ;amp;amp;action=edit', 'Edit');"   /a  
 /code   re  
 
 p However, when accessing the same page on the other cluster node, the editing links generated are NOT for inline editing. Instead, the links generated are for direct access to the wcmAuthoring page, rather than the embedded inline style - looking something like this:    
 
 pre  code   a title="Edit" class="icon-edit" href="/isip/myportal/sehm1/wcmAuthoring/!ut /c5/rZBJdoJAAETP4gm6MciwZGpkaAjSKLDhYaARZOigAeX0IbtskpVV-_r_FUjB2j6f6iq_10OftyAGqZBpRghhqL9BU3U5aCm6YWlOsFdsDpxADPksbJ7MWq7LoRGDGTdHzxuTGevIJiOyyLV1w-vdJxFzwyWasRvBcEEe_JC5IwoMBQtm10qbdSv9ocE_okDg7YeuBAlIxV9OmidBS4gIttEOYh8C8kKn_1nbl7JskFbtcF5fP9nJU9YGPCMjpYekmORC-OpDLsodM2DnETl6WtHhEg9dRqEp9rpfBCTj9jYSVd5-LAmkcefryoWbZHXgGfFVu94ly9IpZMKPMn9vVIsGZiEw8ViyLeWEz8tjS0hN-VFiTl6wqmjL-nafSFSpWODcOBZuIm-snqybmORRj2Jl8w0ZzF56/dl3/d3/L0lDU0lKQ2dwUkNncFJBISEvb0VvUUFBSVF4QkFJRW95akNVNExnaWNBLzRCRWo4TUF4RW1TQ1VRcE1tRW9SLzdfQ0VTMDBTRDMwR0JMMTBJQURFSUNLUUhRUDUvNl9DRVMwMFNEMzBHQkwxMElBREVJQ0tRSFFQNC93Y21BdXRob3JpbmdBY3Rpb24vZWRpdC9kb2NpZC9jb20uYXB0cml4LnBsdXRvLmNvbnRlbnQuQ29udGVudCUwOGU4N2U2ODA0ODIyZTgxYTgzMmE5NzNlMTg3NTA1MDU!/"   /a

<value columnNumber="1"> p Q1: I guess. It depends on your requirements. Just don't overcomplicate things. Go simple. And be aware that using things like message driven beans means asynchronous processing/responses and the chance for messages to fail or go to a system exception/dead letter queue.    
 
 p Q2: Generally you want to look up Java EE beans via JNDI. Makes life easier IMO. Perhaps you need a servlet or a stateless session bean or something in front as a "controller"? Then you can load the data for the stateful beans from the database when you need the data and/or write the data to the database when you do not need the bean anymore.    
 
 p Q3: Depends on how you configure your cluster and also on which application server you are using. Each server may possibly implement clustering/fail over/sync'ing, etc. differently. I would recommend reading up on your application server documentation to figure that one out. And/or post which application server you are using so others on this forum can recommend something. For example, we use IBM WebSphere Application Server, version 7.0.0.7, Network Deployment Edition. So in our case, we can set up replication of beans/objects between cluster nodes.    
 
 p Q4: I believe the answer is yes if you wish to remain connected to the same cluster node for each subsequent transaction of an end user. (At least from the standpoint of coming in through an HTTP server). I'm guessing if you do not have session affinity turned on, then you could switch to a different cluster node and it may be trickier to locate your data (especially if you do not replicate it between clusters). It can be done, it just might be a performance hit. So I'm guessing the answer here is "yes".

<value columnNumber="1"> p I'm trying to figure out how to build different JARs from the same project in IBM Rational Application Developer.    
 
 p First off, the reason they are not separate projects is because some JARs use the same files.    
 
 p I searched around and found to use ANT or Maven but no examples with Rational, and nothing in Rational (it's IBM, of course) to indicate where to add ANT and its files.  And one I did find was for WebSphere Server and EARs and that is not what I'm building.    
 
 p So.. Right now, I click Export and select the different Java files I need for a JAR.  
It then asks me for the Manifest file, but I just generate a new one, since it always asks me to select it anyway, and I would have to go typing the name every time I want to compile a different JAR (tedious work).    
 
 p The application is a Java Application, an executable jar. It won't run on a server, it runs via command line.    
 
 p So... In the project there is no  em build.xml /em  file either. Only files that seem configurable are:  em org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs /em ,  em org.eclipse.ltk.core.refactoring.prefs /em ,  em .classpath /em ,  em .project /em  and  em MyManifest /em     
 
 p The 2 major reasons I'm looking to do this:  In case someone else takes over or I forget the exact files used for a JAR, and to add build version numbers somehow.    
 
 p This is the  em .project /em , which I think is most likely the one I need, but again.. can't find any documentation for it:

 blockquote  
   p When a message consumer in the point-to-point domain uses a message 
  selector to select which messages it wants to receive, the WebSphere 
  MQ JMS client searches the WebSphere MQ queue for suitable messages in 
  the sequence determined by the MsgDeliverySequence attribute of the 
  queue. When the client finds a suitable message and delivers it to the 
  consumer, the client resumes the search for the next suitable message 
  from its current position in the queue. The client continues to search 
  the queue in this way until it reaches the end of the queue, or until 
  the interval of time in milliseconds, as determined by the value of 
  this property, has expired. In each case, the client returns to the 
  beginning of the queue to continue its search, and a new time interval 
  commences.    
 /blockquote  
 
 p The idea is that in a very busy queue with priority delivery, some messages of a higher priority may appear higher in the queue then the current position of the selector.  Theoretically a higher priority message should be consumed first but the consumer won't see it unless it seeks from the head of the queue.  The cursor is reset to the head of the queue either when it gets to the end or when RESCANINT is reached.  The setting of RESCANINT allows for tuning of how responsive you want the selector to be in finding these higher priority messages.    
 
 p RESCANINT isn't specific to FIFO delivery.  The other case in which this can happen is if there are multiple threads with overlapping selection criteria.  In this case one thread can hold a message under lock and then release it.  Although the message may be eligible for the second thread, if that thread has already passed that position in the queue then it takes hitting the end of the queue or RESCANINT elapsing to restart the cursor to find the message.    
 
 p Rescan interval is in milliseconds and defaults to 5000.  Any positive integer value is accepted, although too low a value will cause thrashing as the cursor is continually reset before any messages can be consumed.    
 
 p As a practical matter, you will receive the messages in order if the queue is FIFO and you have only one reader on the queue for which the messages are eligible, regardless of what RESCANINT is set to.  If message order is to be strictly preserved, there are some additional considerations as described in  em  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv6/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.csqzae.doc/ic11080_.htm" rel="nofollow" Sequential retrieval of messages /a  /em . These boil down to messages having only one path from producer to consumer when considering channels, syncpoints, etc.

<value columnNumber="1"> p (I'm the technical lead for TSPM, or Tivoli Security Policy Manager for others that aren't familiar with the product).    
 
 p The use case you're describing is definitely possible.  You probably don't need to focus on the raw XACML though - we go to a lot of effort to provide a higher-level user interface for authoring policies.    
 
 p One way to model this would be to have each link be represented by a different structure point in TSPM's UI, with appropriate policy attached to each.  For example, two links could have policy that represents "permit all users at any time" and one link could have "permit when current-time is before midnight".    
 
 p You would then call our runtime before rendering each link to see if the currently authenticated user should be able to view it. You could also make one call to get a list of currently viewable links if you prefer.    
 
 p You could use the WebSphere Portal tag library or our Authorization API if you're running on WebSphere.  If you're not, it's really easy to build a web service client for most platforms that can call over authorization service using XACML over SOAP.  For more information on calling the authorization service, see our  a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/wikis/home?lang=en#/wiki/Tivoli%20Security%20Policy%20Manager age/Developing" rel="nofollow" public wiki /a .    
 
 p Edit:    
 
 p I realized I didn't really address your question, which is about what a resource is in terms of XACML.  As you may know, XACML breaks the request context into four sections: Subject, Resource, Action and Environment.  Each of these sections contains zero or more Attributes, each with an identifier and a type. A resource in XACML is simply an attribute, or a combination of attributes, from the Resource section that together uniquely identifies whatever you're protecting.    
 
 p The spec defines the identifier  code urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:resource:resource-id /code  for this purpose, and it can be of any type but is usually a string or a URI.    
 
 p In your use case, each link might have a string identifier like "link-1", "link-2" and "link-3". Your policy would use these identifiers, and your application would pass these in when requesting a decision for each link.

 p Nothing more. Really great and helpful doc.    
 
 p It looks like all three methods do the same. They take original message passed to the method, makes a copy of the message (including body and properties) and sets some control fields like  code MessageId /code  or  code CorrelationId /code  based on original message and put the newly created message into the queue. The only difference between them is setting  code MessageType /code  and probably some conditions how control headers should be copied. But why and when do I need these methods?     
 
 p I would expect that  code PutReplyMessage /code  will take a new message with reply body and original message with request and configure reply message with necessary fields like message type and correlation Id before putting it to the queue. This version seems pretty use less because I always have to create my own reply message to specify its content and configure everything myself. Once I do that, I can simply use the  code Put /code  method instead of  code PutReplyMessage /code .

 p Whether a redelivery will cause a problem really depends on why the exception occurred. If it was due to some transitory issue then a redelivery may work. If you have the kind of problem that is once it occurs will always occur (an example of this would be a JMS TextMessage whose body should contain XML, but doesn't).     
 
 p The JMS API doesn't provide any solution to this itself. This is typically taken care of by the JMS provider and how it behaves will depend on which one you use. WebSphere MQ for instance will redeliver up to a configurable maximum at which point it will move it off to a queue for bad messages. The Service Integration Bus in WebSphere Application Server has similar behaviour. I suggest you consult your JMS provider documentation to determine exactly how it behaves in this situation.    
 
 p If you are running in an application server rollback typically doesn't do anything because the application server will be managing transactions for you.

 p I am doing some investigation into how to shrink the amount of session memory our JSF application is consuming on a per user basis.    
 
 p We are using MyFaces 1.1.7 and Tomahawk 1.1.5 running on IBM Websphere 7.0 patch 19. (Not able to upgrade either of these items at this time)    
 
 p IBMâ€™s guideline is that the session size should be less then 5k â€“ average around 2.5k in order not to impact performance of the server and session replication.  We are currently using Memory to Memory but looking at moving to database as suggested by IBM.    
 
 p Our site was running at about 35M per user.  We changed the number of view states from 100 to 10 and that dropped it down to around 4M.    
 
 p We have several backing beans which are currently session scope and are looking at changing them to request scope.    
 
 p I also found the following:   a href="http://www.econsulting.nl/images df/Tuning%20JSF%20Applications-%20J-Spring%202008.pdf" rel="nofollow" http://www.econsulting.nl/images df/Tuning%20JSF%20Applications-%20J-Spring%202008.pdf /a  which seems to have a lot of information concerning how JSF handles certain content on the pages.  This is still under investigation to make sure what is stated make sense.    
 
 p I have also read somewhere that regardless if the managed backing bean is session or request scope is that the view state will still have the bean and its content.  So the view state size will not change.  Looking for clarification on this one.    
 
 p The questions is are others facing the same issue in which JSF applications tend to consume a lot of memory for a given users session?      
 
 p What are some of the best practices to reduce this size if any or is this just the way when using JSF?    
 
 p Issues with session replication on IBM WebSphere when running a JSF application?    
 
 p Is there any documentation out there on how JSF/MyFaces makes use of the heap memory - Young vs old or should it even be considered in this scope?  Garbage collection tuning?    
 
 p What we see as a result of this is that in the event a user hops to another server, the session data is not present due to how large the data is and how long it takes to replicate.  User experience issues.    
 
 p We had seen an issue in which it appeared that changes to the object in the session was not being updated correctly and have done some session management tuning in which we customize the settings so that all session attributes are written out.  Looking at the .jar file it does appear that myFaces is making the call correctly when the contents of the object in the session changes.  So WebSphere session listener should be picking up that change.

 p When a reply message is sent, the original message context is used to set  em some /em  fields in the message header of the reply but the identity context of the reply message is inherited from the putting application rather than from the original message.  The putter can choose to override some of the fields in the reply message header, for example whether to pass the  code MsgID /code  as the  code MsgID /code  of the reply, put it in the  code CorrelID /code  field or put application-defined values in these fields.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I am curious about the second part of the question. What is the basis of your statement that 'the ESB thing' appears to be fading? I don't believe it is.    
 
 p The problem with ESBs however is that some vendors call their product an ESB, but it actually is much much more than that. In some companies this happened with their  integration product just because Gartner or some other analysts company says that ESB is hot. Marketing strategy is changed: The product is called ESB and maybe somethings are added that are expected in an ESB.  
Paul Fremantle of WSO2 wrote a very good article about what an ESB really is [1].    
 
 p As for OSGi: The first company I saw using it in their middleware was WSO2. I have heard, that TIBCO, another middleware vendor, is also moving or has moved towards using it in their Active Matrix platform.  
OSGi may help in various ways. The most important is that it decreases the effort of the installation of the platform. Install a minimum on each system used to deploy the application, and during deployment the components required to run the application will be added. You do not have to worry about having installed the right plug-ins, add-ons and what not. This is what both WSO2 and TIBCO are doing.  
With some vendors, you see that you need to install an awful amount of software, of which you in the end may be using just a small part (e.g. IBM WebSphere). Because of this, you may have to use over-dimensioned systems, which adds extra costs.    
 
 p OSGi may prevent this.  
Have a look at the presentation of WSO2 about the WSO2 Carbon platform [2]. 
The statement at the end of the presentation says it all:     
 
 blockquote  
   p  em Adapt the middleware to your architecture,  strong not /strong  the architecture to the middleware /em     
 /blockquote

 p I have just upgraded my version of WebSphere Application Server for Developers from 7.0.0.19 to 8.0.0.1. I notice what looks to be a bug in WAS 8. I have an Enhanced EAR, I have a build that creates it. I include a libraries.xml file as well as a deployment.xml in the root of the EAR archive. The application references one shared library. When I deploy the application to WAS 8 the shared library reference does not get configured correctly. When I go into the Admin Console I see that for some reason WAS has surround my library name with quotes. So instead of: 
Spring 3.0.5.RELEASE    
 
 p it looks like: 
"Spring 3.0.5.RELEASE"    
 
 p I can manually fix this in the Admin Console. This didn't occur in WAS 7 at all so I can only assume it is a bug. I have tested this off Windows XP and AIX and the same behaviour occurs.     
 
 p Is there an open issue for this? I don't know where I can search / track open issues for WebSphere. If there is a site to search for open issues please can someone forward me the link to that.

 p  strong Edit: /strong     
 
 p I validated that it doesn't work on multiple computers running same version of WebSphere MQ clients and I also validated that it doesn't work with another code. It works if I rewrite the test to Java and use Java API instead!

<value columnNumber="1"> p  strong Remote client view /strong     
 
 p When your EJB and its your clients will be in a distributed environment - meaning ejbs and clients will reside on separate Java virtual machines. Example : EJBs hosted on a WebSphere Application Server and Servlets that consume EJB APIs hosted on a Tomcat server.    
 
 p  strong Local client view /strong     
 
 p Only when it is guaranteed that other enterprise beans or clients will only address the bean within a single JVM. Example, EJBs as well as the Servlets deployed on the same WebSphere server.    
 
 p  strong No-Interface view /strong     
 
 p Is almost same as local client view, but there are differences. Your bean class is not required to implement client view interfaces in this case.  All public methods of the bean class are automatically exposed to the caller. no-interface view always acquires an EJB reference - just like local or remote views - either through injection or JNDI lookup; but,  Java type of the EJB reference is the bean class type rather than the type of a local interface. This is a convenience introduced as part of Java EE6.    
 
 p  strong Difference between local client view and no-interface view /strong      
 
 p In case of no-interface view, the client and the target bean must be packaged in the same application (EAR). In case of local view, client can be packaged in a separate application than the enterprise application. So, this gives more flexibility in terms of fine-grining your components.    
 
 p You may use local client view vs no-interface view depending on your API usage scenario. It is very likely for no-interface view to receive flexible features in future specs.    
 
 p  strong Reason /strong      
 
 p Historically or otherwise, a client wishing to use EJB services was supposed to "look up" the bean on the container ( with certain initial contexts ). That was because all invocations are made through a special EJB reference(proxy) provided by the container. This allows the container to provide all the additional bean services such as pooling, container-managed transactions etc. So, a client can not explicitly instantiate an EJB with  code new /code  operator. The client view is provided via certain interfaces that the client would have access to. The proxy realization at server side is done based on these interfaces. Different client views are defined to suite different deployment scenarios as mentioned above.

<value columnNumber="1"> p We are using WebSphere Portal 7 and WCM 7 on seperate servers. We have set up WSRP so that we can render the WCM content on the Portal server. The problem I am having is that the recommended settings for the JSR 286 Web Content Viewer (to switch the dynamic link broadcasting featuire off) breaks the links on the rest of the page. If I switch the feature on, then the other links work but the links in the WCM content fail. All the local links (to other virtual portals, or mapped URLs) are rewritten (by Portal) to pass through the WsrpProxyPortlet, even though it is not necessary to do so.    
 
 p Is there a way to use remote rendering on Portal 7 and WCM 7, so that one can use WCM and custom portlets on the same page and the links from, and to, either will both still work?

<value columnNumber="1"> p I am using Eclipse (actually, IBM's AST for WebSphere - based on Eclipse 3.2.1) and the Team Explorer Everywhere plugin for TFS. After starting a new project and getting the code from TFS, I've noticed that attempting to update any Java code results in the following error message:    
 
 pre  code  "This compilation unit is not on the build path of a Java project." 
 /code   re  
 
 p Searching the web resulted in a suggestion that the following be added to the .project file of the project:    
 
 pre  code   natures  
      nature org.eclipse.jdt.core.javanature  /nature  
  /natures  
 /code   re  
 
 p However, doing this results in my package declarations (within any classes) to be marked as follows:    
 
 pre  code The declared package "some.package.name" does not match the expected package "". 
The type java.lang.Object cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from the required .class files. 
 /code   re  
 
 p Another suggestion is to change the build path of the application, such as by deleting and reestablishing the JRE system library. My experience has shown that this option is only available in the Properties menu if the "natures" are added to the .project file.    
 
 p As a last resort I tried generating a new workspace and had the same results there.    
 
 p Is there a specific "nature" for TFS that I need to add, or another solution to this problem?

If your editor doesn't work correctly - you cannot see wndow with most of proterties dividet init tabs, sections. YOu may have ruble with editing EJB descriptors. Try to right click on the ejb-jar.xml and open it with specialized editor (I don'n remember its name, but it is not "xml editor" or "System Default")

<value columnNumber="1"> p I have a requirement that I need to process JMS Messages (via MDB) in a way that Messages belonging to a certain group (a group ID is set) are consumed by the same bean instance. The behaviour I require in this is that Messages with the same group ID are processed sequentially (though message ordering is irrelevant), and tying them to the same MDB-instance should provide that.    
 
 p The messages do not carry any kind of sequence number (as it is irrelevant) and we do not know what the first or last message in a group is (there could theoratically "never" be a last message in a group). We want them to be delivered as soon as the consumer is able to receive them.    
 
 p ActiveMQ provides this exact feature ( a href="http://activemq.apache.org/message-groups.html" rel="nofollow" http://activemq.apache.org/message-groups.html /a ) by simply setting JMSXGroupID. We are bound to WebSphere MQ, though. All I've found out so far is that it is possible to collect Messages of the same group in the queue and using a MessageSelector to receive a "Last Message in Group" Message as described in  a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/0602_currie/0602_currie.html" rel="nofollow" http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/0602_currie/0602_currie.html /a .

It is an Eclipse IDE, it is free and it has a lot of tools for database development and administration built in. It will work with all currently supported versions of DB2 for LUW, DB2 for z/OS, DB2 for i5/OS and even Oracle. Ir also supports all current versions of WebSphere Application Server (I think v6 and higher). You don't have to worry about Java levels as it comes with supported JDK. You can download it from  a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/db2/express/download.html?S_TACT=LKFREE000 ;amp;S_CMP=ECDDWW01" rel="nofollow" the DB2 Express-C site /a .

<value columnNumber="1"> p One way would be to use an asynchronous  messaging pattern, so instead of submitting a request and waiting on a response, you would submit a request and continue on, and have either a callback contract or an external-facing service contract that your service can connect back to (a callback contract is the best option when you're dealing with a typical client-server scenario). The downside to callbacks is that they're only supported using two-way bindings (WSDualHttpBinding, NetTcpBinding, etc.), which will limit interoperability with non-WCF technologies.    
 
 p Another option would be to use an enterprise service bus. That's basically software that sits in the middle and coordinates everything between your client and service. That way if your client times out, the enterprise service bus can trigger a "compensation" activity that ensures both your client and service end up in a consistent state.

 p In order to arrive at that diagnostic I was looking at the output of  code netstat -p tcp /code  before and after a test run and found that the     
 
 pre  code retransmit timeouts 
 /code   re

 pre  code $ no -a

               rto_length = 13

                  rto_low = 1 
 /code   re  
 
 p Which indicates that the retransmission timeouts will take between 1 and 64 seconds and will back-off increasingly, which explains why we've been seeing spikes of 1 second, 2 seconds, 4 second, 10 seconds and 22 seconds but nothing away from these peaks (i.e. no 6 second spike).

 ul  
 li I have a process publishing messages to a topic. /li  
 li I have zero or more subscribers receiving the message. /li  
 li Any subscriber can decide to react on received message = optional "reply".

 li The response must be correlated to original published "request" (because there can be more then one published request). /li  
 /ul  
 
 p Now how to do this? I tried to use common approach from MQ queues where the initiator choose either:    
 
 ul  
 li Set report to  code MQRO_COPY_MSG_ID_TO_CORREL_ID /code . Receiver will take message ID from request and pass it as Correlation ID in response. /li  
 li Set report to  code MQRO_PASS_CORREL_ID /code  + set Correlation ID in the request message. The receiver will take Correlation ID from request and set it as Correlation ID in response message. /li

 p In both cases the sender is aware of message ID or correlation ID passed to request so it can correctly correlate messages but this doesn't work with MQ topics.    
 
 p If I try to follow the mentioned approaches I have a problem immediately when publishing the request - the message ID is not set on publisher side (it is empty) so the first approach is not possible.

 p WebSphere also uses JDBC to connect to DB2, so there is not a problem here neither. Eventually, you have to include the necessary jars to connect to the database.

But when I use WebSphere AS 7, the jsf page is displayed correctly only for the first time. Opening the jsf page in other browsers (with other prefered language selected) I receive the respond always in the locale of first run.     
 
 p While debugging, I found the difference in implementation of ResourceBundle.java: Glassfish uses this class provided in rt.jar of the JDK1.6; but WebSphere has this class inside java.util.jar    
 
 p The ResourceBundle (of WebSphere) called from ApplicationResourceBundle.getResourceBundle() calls handleGetBundle() and finally invokes my.i18n.DbResourceBundle$DBControl.newBundle() . 
Called second (and further) time with different locale it doesn't invoke my override but just returns the same bundle created for first locale.     
 
 p The question: is it possible to code internalizable jsf web-application deployed on WebSphere AS 7.0.07, not digging nor hacking into internals of the AS?

I can see my PIP from TIP console, and I'm able to configure it to provide values for parameters in my policies. However, when those policies are evaluated as a result of an authorization request, my PIP is only asked to provide a value every couple of minutes or so. The old value is used in the mean time.    
 
 p To demonstrate this, my PIP has an internal state consisting of an  code int counter /code  which is increased by one on calls to the  code get*Attributes /code  methods. The single  code String /code  type (environment) attribute produced by my PIP indicates  code "even" /code  or  code "odd" /code  depending on the value of  code counter % 2 /code . I was expecting that the user was granted access every other attempt, but this is not what happens if requests are sent too soon after each other.

<value columnNumber="1"> p Currently your application probably loops through messages until it gets back a return code indicating that the queue is empty.  In order to keep listening for new data, you need to do two things:    
 
 ol  
 li Don't exit the loop when you get back a return code for "empty queue."  Loop around and attempt another  code Receive() /code .  You  strong must /strong  combine this with the next recommendation though. /li  
 li When you perform the  code Receive() /code  do so using a time-out.  For example,  code consumer.Receive(20000) /code  will wait 20 seconds for the next message before timing out. /li  
 /ol  
 
 p If you do not include the timeout, then the application will throw massive numbers of unsatisfied GET requests at the QMgr which will appear to be a runaway app and/or a runaway QMgr and you will see processes with high CPU utilization.    
 
 p You could sleep between  code Receive() /code  calls but this is not very performant.  Using a  code Receive(TIMEOUT) /code  blocks the thread only while no messages are available.  As soon as a message arrives, there is no delay in passing it to the thread.  If you manually sleep the thread, it must poll the queue and will only do so at set  code sleep() /code  intervals.    
 
 p The alternative is that you can set up a callback method so that the thread doesn't block.  For example, if you have a callback method  code OnNewMessageCallback /code  you can create an async message listener with  code MessageListener messageListener = new MessageListener(OnNewMessageCallback); /code       
 
 p Both of these methods are described in the samples. If you installed the SDK and samples, these will be under  code C:\Program Files (x86)\IBM\WebSphere MQ\tools\dotnet\samples /code  or the equivalent, depending on where you installed WMQ.    
 
 p In case you are wondering how to tell the difference between "no message on queue" and some more serious error, check the  code MQException.ReasonCode /code .  If it is 2033, then the  code Receive() /code  timed out.  That and all the other reason codes are defined  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.mq.doc/fc_MQRC_.htm" rel="nofollow" here /a .

<value columnNumber="1"> p As @bkail mentions, WebSphere Application Server's built-in server tracing is typically for IBM support. It is generally too fine-grained and tightly coupled with IBM's closed source code to be of use to customers.    
 
 p However, there are also uses of the trace logs for application support as well. If your application utilizes  a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/logging ackage-summary.html" rel="nofollow"  code java.util.logging /code  /a , these log events will be written to WAS's log files (e.g.  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.nd.doc%2Finfo%2Fae%2Fae%2Fcprf_logging.html" rel="nofollow"  code SystemOut.log /code ,  code trace.log /code  /a ). The log messages written to  code SystemOut.log /code  ( a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/info/aes/ae/ttrb_createloginstance.html" rel="nofollow"  code Level.CONFIG /code  and higher /a ) are typically intended for system administrators. Log messages written to  code trace.log /code  ( a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/info/aes/ae/ttrb_createloginstance.html" rel="nofollow"  code Level.FINE /code  and lower /a ), on the other hand, are messages that are typically intended for developers or troubleshooting and debugging purposes; these messages may be tightly coupled with the code or contain extensive diagnostic information useful in troubleshooting situations. Generally, you only want to  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/info/aes/ae/ttrb_configjavalog.html" rel="nofollow" enable tracing /a  during troubleshooting or development, as this type of extensive logging can be expensive and potentially impact the performance of your applications.    
 
 p As a developer, you should make a first-class distinction between logging intended for your system administrators and logging (tracing) intended for developers or troubleshooting. Logging is a great method for communicating with system administrators and can be an invaluable for troubleshooting, but each of these use cases should be handled differently. This is one of the primary reasons that logging APIs (including  code java.util.logging /code ) provide multiple  a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/logging/Level.html" rel="nofollow" logging levels /a . The  a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_%28software%29" rel="nofollow" article you referenced /a  seems to do a great job distinguishing between logging and tracing (which translates to  code SystemOut.log /code  and  code trace.log /code  in WAS).  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/ctrb_javalogging.html" rel="nofollow" IBM's documentation /a  also provides a good overview of the differences.

 p I have a problem to struggle with. Before end user receives a response from web-service, I should sign the message, that is I extract the current SOAP message and invoke signing web-service. After I'm done, I just send it up the JAX-WS handlers chain. We have used JAX-WS handlers so far. The problem is that WebSphere sometimes refuses to pick up and invoke the handler. I mean, really. I've worked every angle and this just does not work. I've come up with an idea to do the signing in the module. I know it is not a good idea but I will think of something better after the signing procedure works once and for all. The major problem is that I do not know how to inject SOAPMessageContext in the module since WebSphere do it for JAX-WS handler automatically. I have neither not found the api reference to retrieve current SOAPMessageContext with ibm api, nor am I able to set the message in any other way. Is there a light at the end of the tonnel for me?

<value columnNumber="1"> p I just wrote an OracleTextDictionary for openjpa, that converts ordinary 'like' operators into 'contains' operators, when the argument is prefixed with a "magical" marker.    
 
 p In this way, it's possible to use QueryDSL or Criteria Language (or JPQL) with Oracle text.    
 
 p The dictionary detects LIKE statements with a magic marker in the argument, and rewrites the SQL to use a CTX CONTAINS  call.      
 
 p One drawback is that the score is not accessible in a simple way, but it would be possible to enhance the driver to order by the score. Feel free to edit the code :-)    
 
 p I would suppose it's possible to port to hibernate, assuming there is a similar mechanism for tuning database queries to a specific db.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I am a relative newb to EJB.  Background:  I have an MDB using the WebSphere default messaging provider receiving MapMessages that has a java.sql.DataSource to do some work, using preparedstatement, jdbc transaction, etc.  I set up the MDB in the ibm-ejb-bnd.xml and ejb-jar.xml using a JCA adapter with an activation-spec and destination name.  I added a java.sql.DataSource in the ejb-jar and ibm-ejb-jar-bind. I also added the DataSource in the MessageListener with an @Resource annotation.     
 
 p 2 scenarios I am having trouble understanding (first scenario fixed, see update)...    
 
 p  strong Container Managed MDB: /strong  
The DataSource driver is not XA compatible so I enabled "Last Participant Support" in WebSphere.  Still, when the MDB transaction-type is set to Container, I get an error upon commit:    
 
 pre  code [11/28/11 10:56:10:988 MST] 0000002e RegisteredRes E   WTRN0063E: An illegal attempt to commit a one phase capable resource with existing two phase capable resources has occurred. 
 /code   re  
 
 p Maybe this is because after the DataSource commits, returns to MessageListener which commits making it the last participant? I believe the default messaging provider in WAS 7 is XA compatible although I haven't seen any documentation that says so explicitly.    
 
 p The message reruns 4 more times immediately after the first error (even though there should be a 30 second delay according to the ActivationSpec in WebSphere).  Each time the same error is thrown.  According to the MessageListener it finished without error, so this error is part of the wonderful invisible container managed transaction.  I don't think I need XA global transactions since there is only one DataSource aside from JMS, I handled transaction rollback programmatically.  Also the JMS msg, MDB is asynchronous, AUTO-ACKNOWLEDGE.  Once the message has been received, it can be acknowledged.      
 
 p If I introduce an application error so there is an Exception, I see this error 5 times immediately (no delay):    
 
 pre  code [11/28/11 10:16:18:857 MST] 0000002b LocalExceptio E   CNTR0020E: EJB threw an unexpected (non-declared) exception during invocation of method "onMessage" on bean... 
 /code   re  
 
 p So I switched to................    
 
 p  strong Bean Managed MDB: /strong  
Commit is working without the XA error and only happens once.  However error handling is still not behaving as I expect or want!  In the MessageListener class, caught Exceptions throw a EJB Exception, which I think should cause the MDB to have my desired behavior:   strong The cause of the exception does not matter to me, when an MDB throws a caught Exception, shouldn't the MDB be retried according to the properties in the WebSphereActivationSpec? /strong   Instead the message goes to the MessageListener 5 times immediately throwing the same error as Container Managed MDB: "EJB threw an unexpected (non-declared) exception..."    
 
 p If I throw a RuntimeException, the "unexpeded (non-declared) expecetion" message doesn't happen, but the message is still retried 4 times immediately, instead of waiting for the retry delay.    
 
 p Thanks for reading, any help or insight is greatly appreciated!    
 
 p  strong UPDATE: /strong   I ended up solving the XA compatibility issues by switching the datasource to XA compatible.  In WAS admin console:  Resources- JDBC Providers- DB2 Universal JDBC Driver Provider- Change implementation class name to: com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2XADataSource    
 
 p I'm still having the same problem when the message fails though.  It is retried immediately instead of according to the ActivationSpec in WAS.

 p This problem looks like it's more than just a hibernate configuration problem - hibernate is looking for the UserTransaction at what IBM say is the correct UserTransaction JNDI location ('java:comp/UserTransaction') - see  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.websphere.base.doc%2Finfo%2Faes%2Fae%2Fcjta_glotran.html" rel="nofollow" this infocenter document /a .    
 
 p Furthermore, I can reproduce the problem in a simple web app that has an MBean that does the lookup:    
 
 pre  code public class JTALookup extends NotificationBroadcasterSupport implements JTALookupMBean { 
  Log log = LogFactory.getLog(JTALookup.class);

      log.info("Successfully looked up 'java:comp/UserTransaction' [" + usrTxn + "]." ); 
    } catch (NamingException e) { 
      log.info("'java:comp/UserTransaction' lookup failed"); 
      throw new RuntimeException("Failed to lookup JTA user transaction", e); 
    } 
  } 
 /code   re  
 
 p and a context listener that invokes the lookup during start up and then registers the MBean:    
 
 pre  code public void contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent sce) { 
 
    log.info("Initialising context"); 
 
    JTALookup jtaLookup = new JTALookup(); 
    jtaLookup.lookupUserTransaction(); // This succeeds 
    log.info("Looked up JTA transaction"); 
 
    MBeanServer mbServer = AdminServiceFactory.getMBeanFactory().getMBeanServer(); 
    log.info("Got MBeanServer"); 
 
    try { 
      mbServer.registerMBean(jtaLookup, new ObjectName("webJTALookupStub:type=JTALookup")); 
      log.info("Registered dummy MBean");

 p IBM do state that the UserTransaction lookup is not available to:    
 
 ul  
 li  p CMT Enterprise beans `http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/info/aes/ae/cjta_glotran.html    /li  
 li  p Async Beans created by EJBs `http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.javadoc.doc/web/apidocs/com/ibm/websphere/asynchbeans ackage-summary.html?resultof=%22%61%73%79%6e%63%68%62%65%61%6e%22%20%22%75%73%65%72%74%72%61%6e%73%61%63%74%69%6f%6e%22%20%22%75%73%65%72%74%72%61%6e%73%61%63%74%22%20    /li  
 /ul  
 
 p Apologies for the non-functional links - I'm a new user and so can only post two working links.    
 
 p Do plain old MBeans fall into either of these categories from IBM's point of view?    
 
 p Interestingly, the UserTransaction appears to be available on JNDI lookup 'jta/UserTransaction' and using that as a fallback option seems to work - but:    
 
 ul  
 li  p WAS 7 is Java EE 5 compliant and as of J2EE 1.3 'java:comp/UserTransaction' is the specified JNDI location for the UserTransaction - see the J2EE 1.3 spec `http://java.sun.com/j2ee/j2ee-1_3-fr-spec.pdf    /li  
 li  p Using a lookup from an earlier version of the EE specification seems like a potential source of other bugs, and might only be addressing part of my problem - the fact that WAS thinks my MBean's thread is not associated with an application could cause other issues.    /li  
 /ul  
 
 p One further point to note is that the UserTransaction is also hidden to threads for work submitted from the MBean to the application's work manager (an IBM work manager) - which could be because it's treating that work like it's an async bean submitted by an EJB?    
 
 p Possible explanations that have occurred to me are:    
 
 ul  
 li  p There might issues with how IBM set up MBean threads in WAS 7 and associate then with the applications that register the MBeans.    /li  
 li  p There might be some additional configuration options for the MBean registration that would let WAS know that it should associate the MBean with the application that registered it. I have tried several alternative approaches but saw the same exception each time:    
 
 ul  
 li  p Registering the MBeans with UserCollaborators and xml descriptors    /li  
 li  p Registering them with ModelMBeanInfo    /li  
 li  p Registering them with the AdminService rather than the MBeanServer    /li  
 li  p Enhancing the ObjectName for the MBean with additional properties (Application, J2EEApplication) at registration    /li  
 /ul  /li  
 li  p There might be some additional configuration options for the jmx client request that would let WAS know that it should associate the MBean invokation with the appropriate application. This forum post suggests it's possible to configure a client application to have access to the initial context: `http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=14021995    /li  
 li  p I might just not be supposed to try to use MBeans this way - despite IBM's statements that I should be able to. It's been suggested that EJBs are the appropriate solution for this kind of requirement.    /li  
 /ul  
 
 p Any light that can be shed on this problem would be greatly appreciated.

   p Arquillian has been suggested as a very good option for integration testing. However, it looks geared towards more "modern" applications; most of the examples make use of JEE 5+ and Maven. We're using J2EE and Ant. We're also currently tied to Java 1.4, and while it may be possible for us to move to Java 5, we won't be upgrading to EJB 3.x any time soon. We're also likely to stick with Ant.    
   
   p With these constraints in mind, is it possible to use Arquillian?    
 /blockquote  
 
 p Note: I'm an Arquillian contributor. I've tried to be unbiased in my answer.    
 
 p This would really depend on how your tests are executed. If you are attempting to use Arquillian's support for in-container tests, then you're unlikely to find a solution. WebSphere Commerce 6 uses WebSphere 6.0 as the underlying container, which is not supported by Arquillian at the moment. If you can hypothetically use a version of WebSphere Commerce that uses WAS 7.0 or 8.0 as the foundation, then most of my answer can be ignored, since these containers are supported.    
 
 p You can attempt to run tests from the client using the  code @RunAsClient /code  annotation, instead of the container, and this is more likely to succeed. Note that, you'll need to perform the deployment in some manner without a  code @Deployment /code  annotated method, because of the afore-mentioned absence of support for WAS 6 in Arquillian.    
 
 p If you intend to use Ant instead of Maven, then the only requirement is that all dependencies be present in the classpath. Unfortunately, there is no uber JAR or distribution for Arquillian, so for now, you'll need to know all the dependencies upfront.    
 
 p Note - Building in WebSphere 6.0 support for Arquillian may not be a trivial activity, as compared to other more recent containers:    
 
 ul  
 li Firstly, there have to be means for deploying the archive. I'm not sure if the mechanism used in WebSphere 7 and 8 container support can be ported over. /li  
 li Supporting in-container tests in Arquillian for WAS 6.0 may require supporting the Servlet 2.4 protocol for running tests. Currently, Arquillian supports Servlet Spec 2.5 and 3.0 for packaging it's ServletTestRunner. This is of course, necessary if the JMX protocol and the accompanying JMXTestRunner cannot be used. /li  
 /ul  
 
 blockquote  
   p Or do better alternatives exist for integration testing legacy enterprise Java applications?    
 /blockquote  
 
 p I would normally advise folks to use a mix of  a href="http://cargo.codehaus.org/" rel="nofollow" Cargo /a  and JUnit for  a href="http://cargo.codehaus.org/Functional+testing" rel="nofollow" functional testing /a  legacy apps, but even Cargo does not appear to support WebSphere 6.0.    
 
 p You might find  a href="http://www.junitee.org/" rel="nofollow" JUnitEE /a  to be a better fit for your needs if you are willing to package the JUnitEE TestRunner in your archive; note that JUnitEE's last release was in 2004, and the  a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=junitee-user" rel="nofollow" mailing list /a  is a bit inactive, so YMMV.

 p It's written for WebSphere 5 or 6 but the idea should work for version 7 too. Basically you create a custom resource environment provider, which returns objects of your own type via a factory. The factory implements javax.naming.spi.ObjectFactory and gets its input from Websphere.

<value columnNumber="1"> p There is an article with sample code  em  a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/0610_woolf/0610_woolf.html" rel="nofollow" Running a standalone Java application on WebSphere MQ V6.0 /a  /em  which walks you through most of your questions, including how you might test with a free WMQ trial install.  The main difference (as discussed in the comments) to v7 or v7.1 is that there is no broker component to start if you want to use topics.  Other than that, the article should work fine with the current WMQ client and/or server.    
 
 p In addition, please refer to the  em  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.csqzaw.doc/uj10120_.htm" rel="nofollow" WebSphere MQ Using Java /a  /em  manual (v7.0 client) or the  em  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.mq.doc/zd00050_.htm" rel="nofollow" Using WebSphere MQ Classes for Java /a  /em  manual (v7.1 client) for the appropriate  code CLASSPATH /code  and other settings for your client.  Remember to use the Infocenter appropriate to your client version and not to the server version.  You can mix and match client and server version but you get only the features supported by the server.  For example, using the WMQ v7.1 client with the WMQ v7.0 server is perfectly valid.    
 
 p Finally, there are a number of sample programs supplied with the free client download that do exactly what you are describing.  Some use JNDI to lookup the WMQ resources, others use Java methods and can be populated with standard Java property files.  The ones with a  code -nojndi /code  option show how to initialize your WMQ objects in the code at run time.  These are under      
 
 pre  code [WMQ Install path]\tools\wmqjava\samples 
 /code   re  
 
 p ...in the latest Windows client install ( a href="http://ibm.co/SupptPacMQC71" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MQC71 /a ).  You can also use the v7.0 client ( a href="http://ibm.co/SupptPacMQC7" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MQC7 /a ).  I would recommend using the samples to get started rather than starting from scratch.  Why reinvent the wheel, right?    
 
 p In addition to the many sample programs, the vendor install includes all of the requisite jar files.  Note that what goes in the  code CLASSPATH /code  changes by WMQ client version so refer to the Infocenter.  The later versions are much simpler and require only a couple of jar files in the  code CLASSPATH /code .    
 
 p If you want to  a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/ws/wmq/" rel="nofollow" download the WMQ trial /a  for testing and do not have Administrator rights on your Windows workstation, you can install it easily on a RedHat or SUSE virtual machine.  With a bit of massaging you can also easily install on Ubuntu as described in an Andy Piper  a href="http://andypiper.co.uk/2011/09/12/websphere-mq-and-ubuntu-and-other-developer-resources/" rel="nofollow" blog post /a .

<value columnNumber="1"> p RTSJ compliant implementations are required to support at least priority inheritance; priority ceiling is optional.  IBM WebSphere Real Time, for example, supports priority inheritance and relies on the operating system to provide priority inheritance for all Java locks (which means there is always a pthread mutex associated with any locked object, though we still have ways to make that faster than it would otherwise sound, especially for locks that are not actually contended).  Spin locks, which traditional non-real-time JVMs tend to employ to accelerate shortly held locks, cannot be used in real-time JVMs because they introduce livelock issues when you've got threads running at different priority levels (for SCHED_RR / SCHED_FIFO policies, anyway, where higher priority level preempts, period).

<value columnNumber="1"> p Here are a few options to consider as alternatives to JMS -    
 
 ul  
 li  p Use  a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=316" rel="nofollow" Java EE environment entries /a . These are scoped to the application, and WAS will automatically propagate any changes to all servers against which the application is deployed. This is a good approach since it is the standard Java EE approach to application configuration, if it is robust enough to meet your use case.    /li  
 li  p Use a  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tcws_sharedlib.html" rel="nofollow" WebSphere Shared Library /a . This allows you to link your applications to static files external to your application (i.e. on the filesystem), such that they are available on your classpath. Although these files are located on the node file systems, there is a way that you can place these files in WebSphere's centralized configuration repository such that they are automatically propagated to all WAS nodes. For more details on this, see  a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6666231/script-interface-to-install-an-arbitrary-files-to-all-nodes-in-websphere/6683320#6683320" this answer /a .    /li  
 /ul  
 
 p Both of these options are optimized for static configuration; in other words, configuration settings that are intended to be set at assembly-time, deployment-time, or to be changed by system administrators, but they are not typically used for values that change frequently, nor are they generally changed programmatically at runtime. WAS does allow your applications to pick these configuration settings in a rolling fashion, such that no application downtime is required though.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I am having a hard time with X509 certificate-based WS-Security in WebSphere v7.    
 
 p Here's a little background: 
We are using spring-ws in our application, and we allow for UsernameToken profile security or X509 security. The two are implemented using the Xws Security interceptor, which runs off of the Xws Security Framework:    
 
 p  a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17802_01/webservices/webservices/docs/1.6/tutorial/doc/XWS-SecurityIntro4.html" rel="nofollow" http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17802_01/webservices/webservices/docs/1.6/tutorial/doc/XWS-SecurityIntro4.html /a     
 
 p We implement the security on both the client-side  ;amp; the server-side, both using the XWSS interceptor. There are two issues:    
 
 ol  
 li The javax.xml.crypto class returned from WebSphere for "http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n#" or any CanonicalizationMethod is not compatible with XWSS interceptor. We are seeing this error in the message log on the server-side: /li  
 /ol  
 
 p 12/5/11 17:26:41:098 EST 00000023 XwsSecurityIn W org.springframework.ws.soap.security.AbstractWsSecurityInterceptor handleValidationException Could not validate request: com.sun.xml.wss.XWSSecurityException: javax.xml.crypto.MarshalException: java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException: class configured for TransformService: com.ibm.xml.crypto.dsig.dom.transform.ExcC14nTransformer not a TransformService; nested exception is com.sun.xml.wss.XWSSecurityException: com.sun.xml.wss.XWSSecurityException: javax.xml.crypto.MarshalException: java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException: class configured for TransformService: com.ibm.xml.crypto.dsig.dom.transform.ExcC14nTransformer not a TransformService    
 
 p I think the best thing to do here is override which implementation is used for decrypting these types. We do include the xmldsig-1.0.jar in our war file (which gets deployed with the classloader set to parent-last). Does anybody know of a way to overwrite this? I tried specifying "org.jcp.xml.dsig.internal.dom.XMLDSigRI" in the java.security in my runtime environment, but that did not work. We are including the xmldsig-1.0.jar in our application.    
 
 p This seems like a compatibility issue between IBM's JRE  ;amp; Sun's JRE. The XWSS interceptor was written by Sun, so they may have taken some things for granted.     
 
 ol  
 li  p We are getting a NullPointerException on the client-side trying to insert the header elements needed to sign the request. We are using xerces for our DOM implementation, but this seems to be along the lines of the SOAPFactory. I tried setting the property "javax.xml.soap.SOAPFactory" to "com.sun.xml.messaging.saaj.soap.ver1_1.SOAPFactory1_1Impl", but that did not seem to fix the issue. Here is the stack trace:

The perspective is web services (specifically JAX-WS) but I'm sure some of the principles carry over. With that post, I mostly relied on the following  a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/1009_chung/1009_chung.html" rel="nofollow" developerworks article /a .    
 
 p Also...not sure if you can consider this, but there are products that do token translation for you. The place I works is an IBM shop and tends to bleed blue pretty heavy, so I only know of the IBM stack (which may help you with WebSphere), but I'm sure there are other products and/or free/open source projects you can use. An example with IBM tooling is the IBM WebSphere DataPower appliance. I believe some of the IBM Tivoli products can help in that area as well.    
 
 p Also...from my experience with LTPA. IBM does not let you generate the tokens if you are not running in the container (ie, a WebSphere box). So testing gets a bit tricky.

<value columnNumber="1"> p Disclaimer: I realize that JSF 2.0 exists and am familiar.  This question is in regard to JSF 1.1 under IBM WebSphere.    
 
 p I have heard/seen varying degrees of support for the notion that ALL JSF components on a page need to have an ID attribute specified at development time.  When I say "ALL" components, I mean everything... including components that are traditionally "output only", e.g.,  code   h:ouputText  /code ,  code   h:panelGroup  /code , code   h:panelGrid  /code , etc...    
 
 p This question continually comes up internally, in response to the appearance of "Duplicate Component ID" exceptions in the logs.  The components that claim to have duplicate IDs sometimes are JSF-generated IDs, or are IDs of elements that cannot be explicitly set (e.g., elements in a row of a grid with n-number of rows).    
 
 p I'm looking for some objective guidance on what IDs should, could, or need to (or not) be set in regard to the gamut of JSF components.    
 
 p My main concern is two-fold:    
 
 ul  
 li retro-actively adding IDs to everything (even things that probably do not need them) in a mad-dash to eliminate any possibility 
of a duplicate component ID exception occurring may not be the best 
use of time.  /li  
 li the resultant bloat in the HTML stream at 
run/render-time is just plain ugly, e.g.,   code   span  /code  elements with IDs 
that add absolutely no constructive value to the page /li  
 /ul

<value columnNumber="1"> p A Web server exclusively handles HTTP/HTTPS requests.  It serves content to the web using HTTP/HTTPS protocol.    
 
 p An application server serves business logic to application programs through any number of protocols, possibly including HTTP.  The application program can use this logic just as it would call a method on an object.  In most cases, the server exposes this business logic through a component API, such as the EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) component model found on J2EE (Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition) application servers. 
The main point is that the web server exposes everything through the http protocol, while the application server is not restricted to it. 
An application server thus offers much more services than an web server which typically include: 
A (proprietary or not) API  
Load balancing, fail over...  
Object life cycle management,  
State management (session),  
Resource management (e.g. connection pools to database),  
Most of the application servers have Web Server as integral part of them, that means App Server can do whatever Web Server is capable of.  Additionally App Server have components and features to support Application level services such as Connection Pooling, Object Pooling, Transaction Support, Messaging services etc.     
 
 p An application server can (but doesn't always) run on a web server to execute program logic, the results of which can then be delivered by the web server. That's one example of a web server/application server scenario. 
A good example in the Microsoft world is the Internet Information Server / SharePoint Server relationship. IIS is a web server; SharePoint is an application server. SharePoint sits "on top" of IIS, executes specific logic, and serves the results via IIS. 
In the Java world, there's a similar scenario with Apache and Tomcat, for example.    
 
 p As web servers are well suited for static content and app servers for dynamic content, most of the production environments have web server acting as reverse proxy to app server. That means while service a page request, static contents such as images/Static html is served by web server that interprets the request. Using some kind of filtering technique (mostly extension of requested resource) web server identifies dynamic content request and transparently forwards to app server.  
Example of such configuration is Apache HTTP Server and BEA WebLogic Server. Apache HTTP Server is Web Server and BEA WebLogic is Application Server. 
In some cases, the servers are tightly integrated such as IIS and .NET Runtime. IIS is web server. when equipped with .NET runtime environment IIS is capable of providing application services

<value columnNumber="1"> p I don't know the other transports but I know that WebSphere MQ doesn't do this and I believe that the explanation why would apply broadly across the category.  I'd be very surprised to find that any messaging  em transport /em  actually provides this.  Here are a few reasons why:    
 
 ul  
 li Async messages are supposed to be atomic.  Different vendors make their own accommodations for message affinity (a relationship between two or more messages) but as a rule, message affinity is to be avoided.  Your use case not only requires the transport to deal with message affinity, but to do so over an indeterminate interval between related messages. /li  
 li Message payload is a blob.  For performance reasons, WMQ doesn't touch message payloads except for things like compression or code page conversion.  Anything that requires parsing the message payload is a job for WebSphere Message Broker, DataPower or WebSphere ESB.  I would expect any messaging transport which claims to be performant would face similar issues because parsing payloads results in longer code paths and non-linear performance degradation.  The exception is message properties but WMQ uses these for selection only and I expect that is generally the case. /li  
 li Stateless operation.  As a transport, the state of the application may be stored in a persistent message but the state of the transport layer should not depend on the state of the application  em across different units of work /em .  Again, an ESB type of product is best suited when you want to delegate  em management /em  of some of the application state to the messaging layer and especially when such management spans many units of work. /li  
 li Assured delivery. WMQ was designed to never lose your persistent message.  If the app explicitly sets expiry the message might go away  em because the sender said it was OK to do so /em .  If the message is non-persistent it might go away, but only in an exceptional condition and, again,  em because the sender said it was OK to do so /em .  The use case you describe might result in a message going away not because the sender said it was OK, or even because the recipient said it was OK but because of an interaction with some unrelated 3rd party who happened to beat you to the queue with a duplicate value.  What if that first message has an invalid header or code page problem and gets rolled back?  What if I as an attacker spew out garbage messages with all possible 4-digit values for discriminator? /li  
 /ul  
 
 p As I said, I don't know the other messaging products so there may be something out there which meets your requirement and if so I'll be interested to read about it.  However in the event hat nobody replies, this post may shed some light on the reasons why.

<value columnNumber="1"> p The recommended answer from a security standpoint is that the other org should be requiring you to use a full QMgr and not a client.  A channel connection from an external QMgr will only ever issue  code CONNECT /code ,  code INQUIRE /code  and  code PUT /code  commands.  A client connection has access to the entire WMQ API and can execute any API call on any object.  For example, if the other party uses structured data in their queue names (an account number for example) a client app can cycle through all possible names to enumerate all the account numbers.  If the call returns 2035, the object exists but authorization failed.  If the call returns 2085 the object does not exist.  In addition to allowing various types of enumeration, a client that gets stuck in a connect loop can throw hundreds of reconnect attempts per second at a QMgr that will completely tie up a listener.  So clients are inherently more dangerous to accept connections from on a QMgr and clients from 3rd parties even more so.  However, clients are free and the cost often outweighs the risk, especially when the application is not moving high-value transactions or sensitive data.  If I were charged with connecting to a vendor's QMgr and they allowed the choice of client connections or QMgr connections and the application was high-visibility or mission critical, I'd choose a full QMgr.    
 
 p Another aspect to consider is that the QMgr-to-QMgr channels are more resilient to network connectivity problems.  This is because two QMgrs keep track of message sequence numbers, hold batches under syncpoint until acknowledged and are capable of negotiating channel recovery automatically without losing or duplicating any persistent messages.  Because a client channel gives you as the developer full access to the API, including the freedom to write programs that sacrifice reliability for performance, it is possible to write a client app that loses or duplicates messages.  In fact, an inherent problem with async message over a network is that session recovery issues can create ambiguous outcomes that lead to duplicate messages.  This is not specific to WebSphere MQ and in fact, the JMS specification talks about this issue and notes that it is the application's responsibility to properly account for "functionally duplicate" messages produced as a result of session recovery.  You can eliminate the possibility of message loss by always using transacted sessions but eliminating the possibility of sending a dupe message takes a bit of work.  Two QMgrs talking use a protocol that eliminates any such ambiguity.    
 
 p As for the performance metrics, take a look at the Performance Reports for your platform.  These are all available from the  a href="http://ibm.co/SupptPacs" rel="nofollow" SupportPacs landing page /a .  Look for the SupportPacs with names like  code MP** /code  such as SupportPac MP71 for Windows or SupportPac MPL5 for Linux.

 p To summarize: in general, your application should not attempt to change the isolation level if the resource reference configures the connection as shareable. If you look at the  em Requirements for setting data access isolation levels /em  topic in the WAS infocenter, you will also find the following statement:    
 
 blockquote  
   p Trying to directly set the isolation level through the setTransactionIsolation() method on a shareable connection that runs in a global transaction is not allowed. To use a different isolation level on connections, you must provide a different resource reference.    
 /blockquote  
 
 p On the other hand, section 7.9.1 of the JCA 1.5 spec describes scenarios where an app server may still allow an application to change the isolation level, even if the connection is shareable. Basically this applies to scenarios where the connection is configured as shareable, but where it is effectively not shared (because there is no need to share the connection between multiple components).    
 
 p The  em Extensions to data access APIs /em  topic in the infocenter suggests that WebSphere supports this:    
 
 blockquote  
   p applications [...] cannot modify the properties of a shareable connection after making the connection request, if other handles exist for that connection. (If no other handles are associated with the connection, then the connection properties can be altered.)    
 /blockquote  
 
 p Therefore you should be able to use setTransactionIsolation() to change the isolation level in particular scenarios, but this depends on how your application uses the connection.    
 
 p Finally, you didn't describe in detail how you monitored that at the database level, but you need to take into account that at some point the app server needs to reset the isolation level on the physical connection. Therefore, if setTransactionIsolation() succeeds, the change may be in effect only for a short time on the physical connection.    
 
 p Note that there are a couple of ways to avoid all these complications (that may or may not be applicable in your case):    
 
 ul  
 li Instead of using setTransactionIsolation(), configure the appropriate isolation level on the resource reference, and if necessary use multiple resource references. /li  
 li Use the WebSphere specific WSDataSource API to specify the expected isolation level before acquiring the connection. /li  
 li Modify your SQL to change the isolation level on a per query basis (e.g. use  code WITH UR /code ). /li

 /code   re  
 
 p I updated my post to include the steps I've done. I am using Eclipse as my IDE and the version of my Axis2 is axis2-1.6.1. My JDK version is 1.6.    
 
 p The steps below is how I created my web service and deploy it on Tomcat. I haven't encountered any problem on running it on Tomcat.    
 
 ol  
 li Set Axis2 Preferences. Browse the location of axis2-1.6.1. Click Ok. /li  
 li Create Dynamic Web Project. For the mean time, I set the server to Apache Tomcat v5.5. I also modify the configuration to include Axis2 Web Services under Project Facet. Axis2 Web Services Core and Extensions are Version 1.1. Dynamic Web Module is Version 2.4. Java is Version 1.6. JavaScript is Version 1.0. /li  
 li Create HelloName class with a hello method. The parameter of the method is the name of the person. The return type of the method is a String consisting of "Hello, " + the name of the person. /li  
 li Right click on HelloWorld class. Click New   Other   web Service. Server runtime is Tomcat v5.5 Server. Web service runtime is Apache Axis2. Click Finish. /li  
 /ol  
 
 p The steps below is how I deployed it on WebSphere: (I am using a WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0.0.0.)    
 
 ol  
 li Modify axis2.xml. Add parameter "EnableChildFirstClassLoading" to it and set its value to true. This is as instructed on the Application Server Specific Configuration Guide found at the Apache Axis2's website. I am following the guide for WebSphere since I'm using WebSphere. /li  
 li Export project as war. Uncheck Optimize for a specific server runtime. Browse Destination. Click Finish. /li  
 li Install war on WebSphere. Select Fast Path and accept all defaults. Set the Context Root to "/HelloName". /li  
 li Modify Class loader order of the module under Manage module. Set it to Class loaded with local class loader first (parent last). This is also as instructed on the guide. /li  
 li Click Ok. Then Save. Click Ok again. Then Save. /li  
 li Start it. /li  
 /ol  
 
 p After following these steps, I am encountered the error I above. The guide I followed is located at:  a href="http://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/docs/app_server.html" rel="nofollow" http://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/docs/app_server.html /a  . Under the WebSphere portion, it says that I must modify axis2.xml and add "EnableChildFirstClassLoading" parameter and set the value of it to "true". It also says that I must modify the application configuration to enable parent last class loading for the Web module. I did both of them but to no avail. I did not set the repository location outside of the installedApps directory since I won't be upgrading it and I'm only testing the project. I also have no plans to add any additional modules.    
 
 p Updates:    
 
 p It's now working. Apparently, "EnableChildFirstClassLoading" is already existing on axis2.xml. I didn't notice it so I added a new parameter and even though the value of my new parameter is set to true, it was overriden by the other "EnableChildFirstClassLoading" parameter which is set to false by default.

 p The Good    
 
 ul  
 li Fast execution /li  
 li Script creation tools are independent projects; there are 2 that I know of:  a href="http://wax.codeplex.com/" title="WAX" WAX /a  (Excel based, codeplex hosted) and  a href="http://watintestrecord.sourceforge.net/" title="WatiN Test Record" Watin Test Record /a  (sourceforge hosted). Neither is as robust as Selenium IDE. /li  
 li Very good IE support.  Can Attach and Detach from running instances. Can access native window handles etc. (See scrip example below) /li  
 li Nuget packaged, easy to get running in .net, visual studio style environments and keep updated /li  
 /ul  
 
 p The Bad    
 
 ul  
 li Googling WatiN "watin xyz" often causes google to recommend "watir xyz" instead. Not that much documentation out there.  /li  
 li What little there is (documentation) is confusing; for example: at first blush it would appear that there is no native support for CSS selectors, especially since there are extensions libraries like 'WatiNCssSelectorExtensions' and many blog articles about alternative techniques likes injecting jQuery/sizzle into a page... then on stackoverflow I found a comment by  a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/52173/jeroen-van-menen" title="Jeroen van Menen" Jeroen van Menen /a  which suggests that there is native support. At least the lead-deve spends time on StackOverflow :) /li  
 li No native xpath support /li  
 li No out-of-the-box remote execution/grid based execution  /li  
 /ul  
 
 p Script Example (C#). You can't do this with Selenium (not that I know off atleast):    
 
 pre  code class IEManager 
{ 
IE _ie = null; 
object _lock = new object(); 
 
IE GetInstance(string UrlFragment) 
{ 
    lock (_lock) 
    { 
        If (_ie == null) 
        { 
            var instances = new IECollection(true);                  //Find all existing IE instances 
            var match = instances.FirstOrDefault(ie= ie.Url.Contains(UrlFragment)); 
            _ie = match ?? new IE(); 
            if (match==null)                //we created a new instance, so we should clean it up when done! 
                _ie.AutoClose = true; 
        } 
    } 
    return _ie; 
} 
} 
 /code   re  
 
 p  strong Selenium /strong     
 
 ul  
 li Slower than WatiN (especially since a new process has to be created) /li  
 li Built-in CSS selectors/XPath support /li  
 li Selenium IDE is good (can't say great, but itâ€™s the best in class!) /li  
 li Feels more java'ish than .net'ish â€¦ but really it's programming language agnostic; all commands are sent to an out-of-process 'Driver'. The driver is really a 'host' process for the browser instance. All communication must be serialised in-out across process boundaries, which might explain the speed issues relative to WatiN.  /li  
 li Decoupled processes - "driver" and "control"  mean more robustness, more complexity etc but also easier to create grids/distributed test environments. Would have really liked it if the "distribution" mechanism i.e. the comms between driver  ;amp; control were across WebSphere or other existing, robust message queue manager.  /li  
 li Support chrome and other browsers out of the box.  /li  
 /ul  
 
 p Despite everything, I went with WatiN in the end; I mainly intend to write small screen-scraping applications and want to use LINQPad for development. Attaching to a remote IE instance (one that I did not spawn myself) is a big plus. I can fiddle around in an existing instance ... then run a bit of script ... then fiddle again etc. Harder to do this with Selenium, though I suppose "pauses" could be embedded in the script during which time I could fiddle directly with the browser.

I did a change to one of WAS data source's custom properties, ifxDELIMIDENT. Originally it was blank. So, I changed it to true. Restarted WAS. And I couldn't login to our application. SQLExceptions were thrown by WAS but was not able to see the stack trace because WAS has truncated the last few lines. After changing the property back to blank, I was able to login to our application.    
 
 p I tried another approach, which was to write a Java class that updates the ITEMMST.STYLE column. I executed this from a shell script. In the shell script, I defined and exported the variable DELIMIDENT with the value 'Y'. But I am still getting 'Syntax error'.    
 
 p  strong UPDATE 2 /strong  
I managed to update the column. This is done by adding the 'DELIMIDENT=Y' property at the end of the connection string which will be passed to the DriverManager object when opening the database connection.     
 
 p But, this won't work for our web application because it uses the WebSphere data source to create the db connection. It would be super if there's a way to set this property in the Informix environment itself.

<value columnNumber="1"> p According to the CommonJ specs, a WorkManager will attempt to stop the execution of a Work only if its isDaemon() method returns true. Non daemon Works are expected to be short running so that they don't need to be stopped.    
 
 p The problem is that by default, the isDaemon() method of the Work implementation used by Spring (and which actually wraps the Runnable) returns false. You can change that by making your Runnable implement SchedulingAwareRunnable.    
 
 p However, that is not enough. If the WorkManager decides to stop the Work, then it will call Work#release() and it is the responsibility of the Work itself to make sure that it stops. In particular, the WorkManager will not attempt to interrupt the thread that is executing the Work (because that is not a reliable way to stop a thread). The problem is that the Work implementation used by Spring has an empty implementation for the release() method, so that you can't use that feature.    
 
 p To summarize: if you want to use Spring, the only way to make sure that the execution is stopped is to design your own mechanism for that.    
 
 p Note that it is still interesting to use SchedulingAwareRunnable, because this will avoid the warnings generated by WebSphere's thread monitor (about hanging threads).

<value columnNumber="1"> p Udo's answer is correct but i would like to add a few more things to this.    
 
 p WPS is superceded with the release of IBM BPM V7.5 which was released in June this year. IBM BPM is a merger of two BPM products - WPS and WebSphere Lombardi edition.    
 
 p Do note that both WPS and BPM 7.5 will use typically a older version of WAS (currently they use a WAS 7.x  version) while WAS 8 has been in the marketplace for a longer period of time.    
 
 p To do JEE stuff, you are better off using WAS as they will keep up pace with the JEE specs while WPS and BPM 7.5 lags and you will not be able to take advantage as they lag for a good period of time.    
 
 p WAS's focuses on JEE and providing hte base for products like WPS, WESB, WebSphere Portal etc. WPS and BPM 7.5 focus on providing a BPM platform for users to build and deploy their BPM solutions.    
 
 p Hope this gives some clarity

 p That works OK, but I'm having trouble when trying to build the  code   portlet:renderURL  /code  tag from that javascript values: when I try to concatenate a string for the renderURL and then reassign to form action like this:    
 
 pre  code var valorAction = '  portlet:renderURL   portlet:param name="nextTask" value="sendFeedback"   portlet:param name="asunto" value="'+valorAsunto+'"    ortlet:renderURL '; 
document.formularioCorreo.action = valorAction;  
document.formularioCorreo.submit(); 
 /code   re  
 
 p The resulting string, when application is deployed, has the structure:    
 
 blockquote  
   p /wps/myportal/ code   portletpath  /code /!ut /c5/ code   a very long random sequence of 
  numbers and letters  /code /    
 /blockquote  
 
 p So one can't figure out where the parameter values are, but if I print the assigned values it shows something like:    
 
 blockquote  
   p asunto: '+valorAsunto+'    
 /blockquote  
 
 p instead of    
 
 blockquote  
   p asunto: this is a sample subject    
 /blockquote  
 
 p I've been trying to use some other ways to concatenate the string; for instance with a  code StringBuffer /code , as shown on  a href="http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/JavaScript/0120__String/StringBufferbasedonarray.htm" rel="nofollow" http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/JavaScript/0120__String/StringBufferbasedonarray.htm /a     
 
 p and also javascript functions like  code encodeURI() /code / code decodeURI() /code ,  code replace() /code , etc. but I just can't get either the URL with the right parameter values or the URL encoded in the structure shown above (the one with the long sequence of chars).    
 
 p Sometimes I manage to get the right parameter values, by manually replacing in the valorAction assignation all the " code    /code " for " code  ;amp  /code " and all the " code   /code " for " code  ;amp;gt; /code " before the concatenation, and then doing the following:    
 
 pre  code var valorAction = valorAction.replace(/ ;amp /g,"  ").replace(/ ;amp;gt;/g," "); 
 /code   re  
 
 p Then I get the following string:    
 
 pre  code   portlet:renderURL   portlet:param name="nextTask" value="sendFeedback"   portlet:param name="asunto" value="this is a sample subject"    ortlet:renderURL  
 /code   re  
 
 p which is OK, but when it has to redirect to the results page it shows an error like this    
 
 blockquote  
   p Error 404: EJPEI0088E: The resource  code   portlet:renderURL   portlet:param 
  name="nextTask" value="sendFeedback"   portlet:param name="asunto" 
  value="this is a sample subject"    ortlet:renderURL  /code  could not be 
  found.    
 /blockquote  
 
 ul  
 li Does someone know how to transform that string to the right format to be rendered? /li  
 li Does someone know any other way to "inject" that parameter values to the renderURL? /li  
 li I'd like to know also if it is possible to pass that parameter values from javascript to JSP so I could put that values in a  code HashMap /code  of parameters to use with the  code PortletURLHelper.generateSinglePortletRenderURL() /code  method, in case the former is not possible.  /li  
 /ul  
 
 p Thank you.

 pre  code subjectFeedback: "'+valorAsunto+'" 
bodyFeedback: "'+valorMensaje+'" 
emailFeedback: "'+valorEmailFeedback+'"

Services are registered in a service registry, and are looked up by interface name. If there are multiple services which implement the same interface, you can get a list back which contains all of them.     
 
 p You can register and access services programatically, but it's better to do it declaratively using declarative services or blueprint. Both provide simple dependency injection for OSGi services. Blueprint is based on spring dm and so should look pretty familiar if you're used to spring. If you're using Glassfish I believe it has a different system for injecting OSGi services, so you can use that or install a blueprint implementation into your container.      
 
 p Many application servers, including Glassfish, JBoss, Geronimo, and WebSphere Application Server allow you to run applications in an OSGi container while still using JEE patterns like servlets and JPA. (If you want to google more, Glassfish call this hybrid applications, which gives you the idea, and others call it Enterprise  OSGi.) This may allow you to move to a nice clean implementation of an OSGi solution without major rearchitecting.

<value columnNumber="1"> p There are some but they are expensive.  Rational Rose was the most well known before it got bought by IBM.      
 
 p The nature of the C++ language makes it really hard to do static analysis. That is why there are so few tools that can do it.  Since the surge in non-C++ development using languages that support reflection/introspection, this type of tooling has really left C++ behind.  That isn't to say that are none, just they are harder to find and usually part of an expensive 4GL-like package.  Rational Rose was mainly a tool that let you diagram a system and it would help track the components and eventually produce source code in a variety of languages.  It could also reverse engineer source code into diagrams to a degree.    
 
 p The Rational Rose product was pretty much superceded by Rational Requisite Pro, with a large portion of the functionality (focussed on Java) being folded into IBM's WebSphere Application Development platform, now referred to as RAD I believe.    
 
 p The Rational tools were well known for being so comprehensive that they were really targeted for large development shops working with an equally large staff, usually starting at 50+ developers, for a single project.    
 
 p Due to the complexity of the C++ language (from a tooling perspective), and the popularity of languages like Java and C#, vendors have really de-emphasized C++.    
 
 p I'm not as knowledgeable about Visual Studio, which still supports C++, but I would be willing to guess that C++ UML support is only in the expensive professional editions like Pro or Ultimate.

<value columnNumber="1"> p Olaf's answer gives you a good start. Just place a file called  code portal-ext.properties /code  in your classpath with the content  code portlet.event.distribution=ALL /code . This will make sure that all portlets that care for the event will receive it, even if it is on a different page.    
 
 p Now for switching the pages: I suggest creating an interface that handles your events. This interface is basically a representation of the portlet.xml file's event-definition-tags in code. This additionally has the advantage that you just have to make sure that your interface and your portlet.xml is in sync. If the interface is not in sync with the remaining source code then this will oftentimes be a compile time error instead of a runtime error (such as wrong parameter types to an event).    
 
 pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"  code interface Events 
{ 
  public static final String EVENT_NAME_X ="eventX"; // as defined in portlet.xml 
  public static final String EVENT_NAME_Y ="eventY"; 
  public void fireEventX(ActionResponse response, ParamType param); 
  public void fireEventY(ActionResponse response, ParamType param); 
} 
 /code   re  
 
 p Then you can have a simple implementation that fires your events that you can use with WebSphere:    
 
 pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"  code public class SimpleEvents implements Events 
{ 
    @Override 
    public void fireEventX(ActionResponse response, ParamType param) 
    { 
        response.setEvent(EVENT_NAME_X, param); 
    } 
 
    @Override 
    public void fireEventY(ActionResponse response, ParamType param) 
    { 
        response.setEvent(EVENT_NAME_Y, param); 
    } 
} 
 /code   re  
 
 p Then you can have another implementation for Liferay which looks like this:    
 
 pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"  code public class RedirectingEvents extends SimpleEvents 
{ 
  private String eventXRedirect; 
  private String eventYRedirect; 
 
    @Override 
    public void fireEventX(ActionResponse response, ParamType param) 
    { 
        super.fireEventX(param); 
        if (eventXRedirect != null) 
          response.sendRedirect(eventXRedirect); 
    } 
 
    @Override 
    public void fireEventY(ActionResponse response, ParamType param) 
    { 
        super.fireEventY(param); 
        if (eventXRedirect != null) 
          response.sendRedirect(eventYRedirect); 
    } 
    // setters  ;amp; getters 
} 
 /code   re  
 
 p Now if you are using Spring IoC (which I happen to know that you do), then you can can configure the implementation as follows in your application-context.xml file:    
 
 pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"  code   bean class="package.RedirectingEvents" primary="true"  
    property name="eventXRedirect" value=" age-after-X-event"   
    property name="eventYRedirect" value=" age-after-Y-event"   
  /bean  
 /code   re  
 
 p Here is how you get the "value"-part for this xml snippet:    
 
 p Open the target page in liferay to which the user should be redirected after an event was fired, while beeing logged with appropriate privileges and click in the menu at the top of the page on Manage- page. There you can set a "Friendly URL". Copy the same URL you entered in the Friendly-URL field (without the unchangable prefix) into the application-context.xml snippet above.    
 
 p In your classes that fire events you can then just allow the Events-interface to be autowired and use it like this:    
 
 pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"  code @Controller 
class Foobar 
{ 
  @Autowired 
  private Events portletEvents; 
  @ActionMapping 
  public void action(ActionRequest request, ActionResponse response) 
  { 
    portletEvents.fireEventX(someParam); 
  } 
  @EventMapping(Events.EVENT_NAME_Y) 
  public void handleEventRequest(EventRequest request, EventResponse response) 
  { 
    Object value = request.getEvent().getValue(); 
    log.info("got Y event! Value is: " + value); 
  } 
} 
 /code   re  
 
 p If you deploy your application on WebSphere Portal, you simple exchange the xml snippet above with the following:    
 
 pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"  code   bean class="package.SimpleEvents" primary="true"   
 /code   re  
 
 p Now you you have a solution that allows you to send JSR-286 messages across pages, switching the pages at the same time, while still being able to deploy you application on both Liferay and WebSphere Portal without any change in code (just configuration needs to be adapted).

<value columnNumber="1"> p We definitely use Geronimo in production!    
 
 p We have used the Tomcat version since 1.0, about four years ago as I recall.  We are currently running mostly 2.1.1.4.    
 
 p One of our apps gets about 1 million page views per day.  The others are nowhere near that, but they are important apps that need to work well.    
 
 p Our choice was based primarily on:    
 
 ol  
 li Price: At the time our company started using Java, we weren't sure what we needed out of an app server.  So we decided to start at free and work our way up, if needed. /li  
 li Basic features: I had experience with WebSphere (base/ND) and plain old Tomcat.  Geronimo had the J2EE features we wanted, all within a lightweight package. /li  
 li Open Source: Our primary client that we use Java for required Open Source. /li  
 li Familiarity: Being an Apache-based server, we were already comfortable with Tomcat, OpenJPA, Axis web services, and others.  Furthermore, we were comfortable with the Apache community as far as bug tracking and other minor things. /li  
 li Support: We expected to be mostly on our own, but knowing that the Apache community was active was important.  As was the availability of commercial support from IBM, as we are an IBM Business Partner. /li  
 /ol  
 
 p Our experience has been great overall.  The servers are very reliable.  I search our logs once in awhile and sometimes see weird errors with a database connection, an EJB call, but those are pretty rare (and quite possibly our code's fault).    
 
 p Performance is impressive.  I joke that we could run Geronimo from my laptop and the clients wouldn't see a difference.  Give it any decent server and it will purr along for months.    
 
 p I'm not sure how many people actual run Geronimo.  I'm rather confused about that.  I've seen slides (years ago) that listed some big names like eBay using it.  The mailing list is active but sometimes seems like only the Geronimo team communicating with each other.    
 
 p The only serious bug I've run into  is (this one)[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GERONIMO-5800].  It is a big deal to us, but of course Geronimo is free and I don't expect them to fix bugs that are important just to me.    
 
 p I've been meaning to check out Apache TomEE server, wondering if it is more actively or openly used.  Just to see how the community and usage compares to Geronimo.

 p Not sure if there is an issue with my spring setup, but I do receive messages through my Active MQ broker, so that part I seem to be good with.    
 
 p Now, the issue is, that when I get a message in through JMS, I would call the above code to insert the JPA entity.  When the code would run, I would get the message "unable to commit a one phase resource in a two phase transaction", or something similar.  What I came to understand is that the Spring JpaTransactionManager does not work with XA or JTA transactions.    
 
 p So, I worked on moving to the Spring JtaTransactionManager.    
 
 p I changed everything I Could think of over to use JTA, here is where I declare my transaction manager:    
 
 pre  code   bean id="transactionManager" class="org.springframework.transaction.jta.WebSphereUowTransactionManager"

      jta-data-source java:APPDS  /jta-data-source   
 /code   re  
 
 p And still, nothing works.  My code runs without exception, but nothing gets persisted to the database.  The message gets pulled off of the JMS Queue, but no data.

 p Lets say A and B. A is JMS application that picks up message from queue and does some business rules processing. A uses B for database persistence. B does all database operations.

A uses programmatic transaction model (yes, we need it) while B uses declarative model (@Transaction annotation). Both were developed using separate bean configurations.    
 
 p Now, in integration, we are facing transaction exceptions. I believe it is due to mis-match between transaction models of A and B. Theoritcally, B will use A's transactional context which is programatic. This makes B's declarative model redundant.

 /code   re  
 
 p It appears that when a thread (T1) executing the servlet's doGet() method calls setAttribute() on the instance of HttpSession implementation (S1), it locks on the monitor of S1. While holding that lock it goes into the iteration of allSessions inside the listener's attributeAdded() method and calls getAttribute(). It looks like inside getAttribute(), WebSphere locks on that instance's monitor (possibly because it is setting a lastUpdateTime field?). So, T1 will in turn lock the monitors of S1, S2, S3, S4, S5... all the while holding the lock on S1 from the setAttribute() call in the servlet.    
 
 p So if at the same time another thread (T2) is locking on another session (S2)'s monitor in the servlet and then goes into the loop in addAttribute(), the threads deadlock on the S1 and S2 monitors.    
 
 p I have been unable to find anything explicit in the J2EE specs about this but this part of the Servlet 2.4 spec implies that the container should not be synchronizing on instances of HttpSession implementations:    
 
 blockquote  
   p  strong SRV.7.7.1 Threading Issues /strong     
   
   p Multiple servlets executing request threads may have active access to 
  a single session object at the same time. The Developer has the 
  responsibility for synchronizing access to session resources as 
  appropriate.    
 /blockquote  
 
 p JBoss does not show any deadlocks when we run the test against it. So my questions are:    
 
 ul  
 li Is my understanding correct? /li  
 li If so, is this a bug or contravention of the J2EE spec in WebSphere? /li  
 li If not, and it is valid behaviour that the developer should know about and code around, is this behaviour documented anywhere? /li  
 /ul

<value columnNumber="1"> p You have probably found a not supported use case of  code HttpSession /code  in IBM WebSphere specific implementation. Why not report it to IBM ?    
 
 p A point you have missed for your implementation: the JavaEE container may passivate  code HttpSession /code  objects (by serializing it on disk or database) to free memory if the server has to handle too many sessions under load. Your listener prevents the garbage collector to free that sessions.    
 
 p By the way, the  code HttpSession /code  object is supposed to be only used by the thread that corresponds to its own session. As you found in specification, in case of multiple concurrent threads from the same session, the code must use synchronization mechanism on the  code HttpSession /code  objet.    
 
 p Session listeners are event-based with all necessary information in event, such a design is enough to avoid the listener to keep all references to living  code HttpSession /code  objects the way you do.    
 
 p Quering from one thread all living sessions in the container is strange and unexpected. It is not the job of a web application but of a monitoring or auditing tool. In that case, other means like JMX query or PMI interface in the specific WebSphere context should be used.    
 
 p To help you, here is an alternate implementation of your listener to achieve the same session attribute count but without keeping any reference on  code HttpSession /code . Beware: it was neither compiled nor tested.

<value columnNumber="1"> p There are a number of detailed recommendations available in the WebSphere MQ Performance Reports.  These are published as SupportPacs.  If you start at the  a href="http://ibm.co/SupptPacs" rel="nofollow" SupportPac landing page /a , the ones you want are all named MPxx and are available per-platform and per-version.    
 
 p As you will see from the SupportPacs, WMQ out of the box is tuned for a balance of speed and reliability across a wide variation of message sizes and types.  There is considerable latitude for tuning through configuration and through design/architecture.    
 
 p From the configuration perspective, there are buffers for persistent and non-persistent messages, an option to reduce disk write integrity from triple-write to single-write, tuning of log file sizes and numbers, connection multiplexing, etc., etc.  You may infer from this that the more the QMgr is tuned to specific traffic characteristics, the faster you can get it to go.  The flip side of this is that a QMgr tuned that tightly will tend to react badly if a new type of traffic shows up that is outside the tuning specifications.    
 
 p I have also seen tremendous performance improvement allocating the WMQ filesystems to separate spindles.  When a persistent message is written, it goes both to queue files and to log files.  If both of those filesystems are in contention for the same disk read/write heads, this can degrade performance.  This is why WMQ can sometimes run slower on a high-performance laptop than on a virtual machine or server of approximately the same size. If the laptop has physical spinning disk where the WMQ filesystems are both allocated and the server has SAN, there's no comparison.    
 
 p From a design standpoint, much performance can be gained from parallelism. The Performance reports show that adding more client connections significantly improves performance, up to a point where it then levels off and eventually begins to decline.  Fortunately, the top number of clients before it falls off is VERY large and the web app server typically bogs down before WMQ does, just from the number of Java threads required.    
 
 p Another implementation detail that can make a big difference is the commit interval.  If the app is such that many messages can be put or got at a time, doing so improves performance.  A persistent message under syncpoint doesn't need to be flushed to disk until the  code COMMIT /code  occurs.  Writing multiple messages in a single unit of work allows WMQ to return control to the program faster, buffer the writes and then optimize them much more efficiently than writing one message at a time.    
 
 p The  em  a href="http://ibm.co/MiceAndElephants" rel="nofollow" Of Mice and Elephants /a  /em  article contains additional in-depth discussion of tuning options.  It is part of the developerWorks  a href="http://ibm.co/dWMMIdx" rel="nofollow" Mission:Messaging /a  series which contains some other articles which also touch on tuning.

The way it works is that when  strong Process A /strong  puts a message on a queue, it specifies the time it will wait for a response message. If  strong Process A /strong  fails to receive a response message within the specified time, the system throws an appropriate exception.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I've got a JAX-WS web service compiled against an IBM WebSphere JRE that does not seem to be compatible with the cxf stack that comes preinstalled/configured with JBoss7, but works with WebSphere/Axis2.  I am not sure why I am seeing this incompatibility as I am not using any Axis2 specific classes (am only using javax.ws classes), but none the less, I get class incompatibility issues.    
 
 p My class has no direct dependence on Axis2, which is why I was expecting that the service would work find with cxf, but apparently not.  I am only using  code javax.xml.ws.WebServiceContext /code  and  code javax.xml.ws.handler.soap.SOAPMessageContext /code .      
 
 p Just to be on the safe side, I've gone through all my pacakged jar files and didn't find javax.xml.ws.handler.soap.SOAPMessageContext anywhere.  Which is good, since it belongs to the JRE.  Which leads me to believe that there is an incompatibility between my the javax.xml.ws provided by my JRE (IBM JRE) and the CXF stack.     
 
 p Consequently, I figured I would try to run the service against the Axis2 stack, but I have no idea how to install it under JBoss7.    
 
 p If anyone can help me understand how the incompatibility and/or how to get Axis2 working with JBoss7, I would appreciate it.

<value columnNumber="1"> p A portal represents a web site that provides a single point of access to applications and information. Portal framework is the portion of a portal that is responsible for the rendering and customization of the portal. 
Portal framework implementation requires implementing set of JSRs for example  a href="http://jcp.org/ja/jsr/detail?id=168" rel="nofollow" JSR168 /a  and  a href="http://jcp.org/ja/jsr/detail?id=286" rel="nofollow" JSR268 /a  (portlet spec v1 and v2).     
 
 p In order to run portlets you need application server that implements portlet container spec (JSR168 or JSR286). It can be one of the big enterprise products :IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic (both have application servers, express application servers and portals) or some open source portlet containers: JBoss, Pluto, OpenPortal , Liferay etc.     
 
 p Security (authentication-authorization) addressed in portlet JSRs. However, portlets are mostly secured with 3rd partiy frameworks (I did it with Spring)

Like Terrell already asked, are you sure about the profile settings?

 p Personally, I would not develop a piece of software that is so dependent on the current working directory as it sounds in your question. I would rather use Java System Property settings to point to a configuration directory or something similiar.    
 
 p Secondly, if you use RAD with a configured WAS (or Tomcat or whatever) server profile, make sure you check the server specific settings inside RAD (context menu of the profile). For example, per default RAD uses its own deployment path for a server profile when it deploys an application to the respective server.

 p Note that it defines a parameter named "com.ibm.faces.portlet.page.view" with the value "/TEIndividual/TEIndividualView.jsp", which is the initial JSP used when the portlet is rendered. br  
I need to conditionally change the value of that parameter based on the result of a database query.    
 
 p I think this might involve a redirect somewhere in the MHFacesHibernatePortlet class. br  
Is that correct, and what method of the class should I modify?    
 
 p  strong Edit, with more info and source code for two classes... /strong     
 
 p I've added code for the MHFacesHibernatePortlet class below, and also the MHFacesPortlet class which it extends.    
 
 p In the application's portlet.xml file, multiple portlets are all configured to use the MHFacesHibernatePortlet class, but each portlet uses a different initial JSP. The "Individual Portlet" above is just one example.    
 
 p I need to conditionally change the initial JSP only for some of the portlets, so I have some code that should be able to check the JSP name against a list of the ones I want to change, then run a Hibernate query, then change the JSP name only if necessary.    
 
 p I saw in  code MHFacesPortlet.processAction /code  that it reads the relevant parameter and passes it to  code request.getPortletSession().setAttribute() /code  under some conditions, so I tried to put my code there and change the  code homeJsp /code  variable, but that didn't work. After adding some logging I found that processAction isn't even called when I go to a page with one of these portlets.

 p SQLIte does offer some extra functionality like "update hooks" etc....and numerous others.

In Sharepoint you can do the same thing with "Webparts". In IBM Portal they are called "Portlets".     
 
 p The portal platform itself handles the user authentification (login / log out), security (groups and access to resources), and depending on the portal, the search, content management, navigation, language management, device detection (mobile or desktop to direct to correct display templates) and provide a way to extend the portal with plugins, portlets, widgets, webparts or whatever they call them in the portal you select.

<value columnNumber="1"> p The error that you are seeing is because your keystore does not have the signing CA's root and/or intermediate signer certificates.  When you get a signed certificate back from the Certificate Authority it must be validated before adding it to the keystore.  Pretty much anyone could have intercepted your signing request and signed the certificate.  The step of validating it when received insures that it was signed by a CA that you actually trust and not some anonymous man-in-the-middle.    
 
 p The way the cert is validated is by checking the CA signature against the public key of the CA that is in your KDB.  For that the CA's certificate must already be in the KDB when you attempt to receive your signed cert.  If the CA uses an intermediate signer certificate (and for a variety of reasons any commercial CA  em will /em  use intermediate certs) then you must also have imported the intermediate cert  em and /em  the root cert.  This forms a certificate chain or certificate path from the CA's root cert through any intermediate certs to your signed certificate.  Each thing in the chain is authenticated by the thing above it until you get to the root.  Your KDB  em must /em  have the entire chain and because each cert is validated by the one above it, you  em must /em  import these beginning with the root and working your way down.      
 
 p Typically your CA will have posted their signer certs on their web site where you retrieve them using SSL.  Fetch those and import them and you will be able to receive your signed cert.    
 
 p As it happens, The Sphere Online Journal just published an article that walks you through this process using Verisign as an example, and with screen shots of importing the root and intermediate signer certs.  The article is about  em  a href="http://www.websphereusergroup.org/go/article/view/252716/the_sphere_journal_online_%E2%80%94_february_2012#4" rel="nofollow" Renewing WebSphere MQ Certificates /a  /em  but the first part of the article creates a kdb file and a signing request, then imports the CA certs and the signed cert.    
 
 p Let's also get you to the correct Infocenter.  Please look at the WMQ v7.0 Infocenter's section on  em  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.csqzas.doc/sy11713_.htm" rel="nofollow" Using CA Signed Certificates /a  /em .  The one you were looking at is for Message Broker and quite frankly the article you linked to is a bit of a mess.  I'll see about getting it fixed.  For starters, that bit about creating the cert in one kdb, getting it signed, then exporting it, deleting it and importing it to the QMgr's KDB is pure rubbish.  Just generate the CSR in the QMgr's own KDB file and receive the signed cert directly to it.  This is much easier and is the process illustrated in the article mentioned above.    
 
 p Finally, if you go to  a href="https://t-rob.net/links/" rel="nofollow" t-rob.net /a  and download the WMQ Security Lab from IMPACT 2011 you will find there a lab guide and some scripts.  These use self-signed certificates but the scripts can easily be converted to use CA signed certificates and then tailored for use in your WMQ network.    
 
 p  strong UPDATE: /strong  br  
Responding to he additional questions in the comments:      
 
 p  em I'm actually planning to use a self-signed certificate, so I guess I only need to extract it and adding it to the client's trust store? /em       
 
 p Yes, that is correct. But here's a problem in the WMB Infocenter page that was originally linked in that it asks you to create a cert with the label  code qmgrname /code  instead of  code ibmwebspheremqqmgrname /code .  The QMgr finds its cert based on the label and so it  em must /em  match the specified format.  So when you create your self-signed cert, mke sure that the label is the literal code ibmwebspheremq /code  with the QMgr name folded to lower case appended.  If you have made a cert with the wrong label, you can always export it to a P12 file and then import it to a new KDB with the right label.    
 
 p  em I used the WMQ SSL Wizard mentioned in the WMQ Security Lab to create the proper configuration. The configuration went smoothly, but when I run the JMS sample included with the SSL Wizard I get the error  code MQJE001: Completion Code '2', Reason '2397' /code , the SSL logs shows the following error  code main, received EOFException: error main, handling exception: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Remote host closed connection during handshake main, SEND TLSv1 ALERT: fatal, description = handshake_failure /code  /em       
 
 p There are a few reasons why that might occur.  Rather than going through all of them, I'll suggest some diagnostic techniques.  When I set up SSL channels, I always use the following procedure:    
 
 ol  
 li Get the channel running without SSL.  This proves that the basic communication path is working (listener running, ports match, channel object definitions match, etc.). /li  
 li If this is the first time that the QMgr is using SSL, or if the kdb has changed, be sure to issue the  code REFRESH SECURITY TYPE(SSL) /code  command. /li  
 li Enable SSL by specifying the same ciphersuite at the QMgr and client but be sure that the QMgr's SVRCONN channel is set to  code SSLCAUTH(OPTINAL) SSLPEER() /code .  This verifies that the  em client /em  accepts  em the QMgr's /em  certificate.  Only when this works, go to the next step. /li  
 li Now change the QMgr's SVRCONN to  code SSLCAUTH(REQUIRED) SSLPEER() /code .  This causes the QMgr to request the client's certificate. /li  
 li If using  code SSLPEER /code  set it to the desired value. /li  
 /ol  
 
 p This process isolates the possible problems so that at any point you know where to look.  If the process fails in Step #3 then there is either an issue with the SSL configuration of the application, or it cannot validate the QMgr's cert.  If the process fails in Step #4 then we know the application's SSL configuration is sound and that it likes the QMgr's cert bu that the QMgr doesn't like the application cert.  If we get to Step #5 then it's just a matter of getting the  code SSLPEER /code  value correct.    
 
 p Because you got a handshake failure that appears to be due to the QMgr closing the TCP connection, I am assuming that you have  code SSLCAUTH(REQUIRED) /code  (which is the default, by the way) and that either the QMgr doesn't have the application's certificate or that you were attempting to use an anonymous connection where the client doesn't require a personal cert.  If that is the case, setting  code SSLCAUTH(OPTIONAL) /code  will get you past the point of failure - although possibly to an entirely new point of failure.

<value columnNumber="1"> p So the original problem is that we run an "industry standard" java based web app application, on WebSphere App Servers with around 100 million visits per year. The issue is after a restart of these appservers, we need to hit a few of the key pages so that the main servlets get compiled before we let the public onto them ... otherwise they tend to crash in the initial crush.    
 
 p On some clusters, its about 6 pages that need to be hit, once for each of 35+ markets.... 200 ish url's!    
 
 p So the script I am working on has all the hard work done of how to put together all these URL's and at the end of it all is a list of 200 url's in an array... now how to hit them?    
 
 p We were using CGI for this earlier and it's main problem was that is was synchronous... taking a loooooong time. Now I am trying to make a simple url.php which will hit one single URL which I can then call from JQuery in an asynchronous way. I don't want to hit all 200 at first of course, probably in batchs of 5 should mean a 500% speed increase :)    
 
 p So onto the url.php . I haven't use php much in the past so sockets is a bit new to me. What I have cobbled together so far is this:    
 
 pre  code function checkUrl($url,$port) { 
set_time_limit(20);  
ob_start();  
header("Content-Type: text lain"); 
$u = $url;  
$p = $port; 
 
$post = "HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\n"; 
$post .= "Host: $u\r\n"; 
$post .= "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.2) Gecko/20060308 Firefox/1.5.0.2\r\n"; 
$post .= "Keep-Alive: 200\r\n"; 
$post .= "Connection: keep-alive\r\n\r\n"; 
 
$sock = fsockopen($u, $p, $errno, $errstr, 10); 
if (!$sock) { 
    echo "$errstr ($errno)  br  \n"; 
} else { 
    fwrite($sock, $post, strlen($post)); 
    while (!feof($sock)){ 
        echo fgets($sock); 
    } 
    ob_end_flush(); 
    } 
} 
 /code   re  
 
 p Which works great if the url is simply someserver.somedomain.com but if the is a Uri tapped on the end it fails (e.g. someserver.somedomain.com/gb/en)    
 
 p As I understand it, all I have done with the code so far is open the socket connection ... but how can I get it to parse the path separately?    
 
 p The only output I need from this in the end is the HTTP Status code (200, 404, 301 etc) though it is important that it does fetch the complete page first in order for it to be compiled properly.

One of the requirements is to have a footer(id is  code div#footer /code ) and a help bar(class is  code div.footer.flotante /code ) that lies just at top of footer while footer is in viewport, but it needs to float at bottom of window while footer is not in viewport... kinda Facebook new timeline toolbar (add to friends, etc) or Mashable social widget, only that from bottom.    
 
 p  img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/VVwFB.png" alt="Scheme of what I want to do"

 pre  code $(window).scroll(function (event) { 
    var barra = $('div.footer.flotante');

    var hf = $("div#footer").height(); 
 
    if (x   hf) { 
        barra.addClass('fixed'); 
    } else { 
        barra.removeClass('fixed'); 
    }

} 
div.footer.flotante.fixed{ 
    position: fixed; 
    bottom: 0px; 
    z-index: 1;

 p With that code I got to float my toolbar in case of a html page with static content (therefore value of  code dh /code  is constant). My problem is that being this a theme development, is expected to have content loaded dynamically to body of document, increasing  code dh /code  value to an unknown amount of pixels. In this scenario the calculation for value of  code x /code  is taking the initial value of  code dh /code , giving as a result a mispositioned floating toolbar.    
 
 ol  
 li How could I recalculate value of  code dh /code  after render that content?  /li  
 li Given that there is no such a property called  code offset().bottom /code , is there a way to temporarily "flip upside-down" document in order to calculate  code offset().top /code  value for my toolbar thus eliminating the need to know final value of  code dh /code ? /li

<value columnNumber="1"> p Take a look at the SPNEGO protocol,  this is what Sharepoint  ( technically IIS ) uses for Single Sign On authentication.  I am not familar with CXF,  but generally most of the WebServices platforms allow you to supply additional headers with your request.  Basically what you need is:    
 
 pre  code 1.  Get authentication token for the sharepoint from user session   
 
2.  Use JAAS to generate tokens. 
 /code   re  
 
 p Look here  a href="http://appliedcrypto.com/spnego/spnego_jaasclient.html" rel="nofollow" http://appliedcrypto.com/spnego/spnego_jaasclient.html /a  and here  a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/jgss/lab art6.html" rel="nofollow" http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/jgss/lab art6.html /a  for more details.    
 
 p For the case when you want to authenticate browser users to sharepoint.  You have to implement SPNEGO protocol in your web app for example you can use  a href="http://waffle.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow" this /a  package do it you.  Most of the modern app servers support SPNEGO protocol  [ JBoss, WebSphere ].   After you implemented SPNEGO protocol,  you can grab the kerberos token from 'Authorization'  header.       
 
 p Then you have two options:    
 
 ol  
 li  p In case you run your web-app with the same identity as the SharePoint front-end you can just resend the same token to the sharepoint.    /li  
 li  p In case you running as a different identity,  you have to use the user's token to go to active directory and request a ticket for sharepoint service on behalf of your user.  The account that your web-app runs under has to be trusted for delegation in Active Directory    /li  
 /ol  
 
 p Also,  I am not sure that SharePoint accepts kerberos tokens within SOAP headers, I believe you have to authenticate using HTTP headers.      
 
 p  a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/534278/configure-tomcat-for-ad-kerberos-impersonating" This /a  question might help you

 p The "Dynamic Web Project" number (2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5) corresponds to the version of the Servlet spec (example. Servlet 2.4, Servlet 2.5, Servlet 3.0).    
 
 p Servlet 2.4 (supported by WebSphere 6.1) uses J2EE 1.4 and J2SE 1.3.    
 
 p Servlet 2.5 (supported by WebSphere 7.0) uses Java EE 5 and Java SE 5.    
 
 p Servlet 3.0 (possibly supported by WebSphere 8.0?) uses Java EE 6 and Java SE 6.    
 
 p So, JAX-RS requires annotations which means it needs Java SE 5, and therefore Servlet 2.5.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I have a page that is executing around 200 ajax requests using jquery.load but it is behaving in a very un-ajax way because the browser is frozen while the results are fetched.     
 
 p By freezing I mean losing control of the browser, not able to scroll it up and down even. Then the results all display at once when it has finished all requests, but I know it is actually fetching the results 6 at a time (browser controlled "same host" policy) from watching the access log of the target server.    
 
 p Though the jquery.load commands are built using a "foreach" loop they are already written to the source of the page when the user loads it (so for all intents and purposes they could all be hand written individually), so its not like the page is waiting for the loop to finish. The last "symptom" is that even if it is only 30 requests instead, the issue is just the same.    
 
 p So it's odd to me and I am looking for ideas of what could cause this and how it could be worked around. It's definitely confusing to the end user especially as it could take 90-100 seconds until all the responses are back and the user regains control of the browser.    
 
 p  strong One small update: /strong      
 
 p I have very similar code running in another webapp that does around 20 requests simultaneously without issue. The difference is that instead of fetching a page, it is ssh'ing to the server and reading/updating a file on the file system via a script. I would have thought that would actually have a little more overhead but it has none of these issues.    
 
 p And as I have said - even 20 requests causes the same issue with the code in question... so I am tempted to think its perhaps curl related... though its pure speculation.    
 
 p  strong The Bigger update Now with infinitely more Code!!! /strong     
 
 p The fuller background to app is this. We run a cluster of some of the highest trafficked WebSphere AppServers in the world, which are running our Commerce applications. The intensity of the traffic means that if we simply let traffic on to an appserver before the JVM is warmed up, they crash! So we hit a few key pages before allowing traffic on, as this precompiles all the major servlets, proportions the JVM, and populates some of the servlet caches. Then the traffic can come onto the server with no issues and they run great.    
 
 p We had a version of the app written in CGI which worked but was so slow due to being synchronous. We are talking about 10 minutes on some clusters to run.  Due to being synchronous requests, only one thread on the appserver and one jdbc connection was being used.    
 
 p So what the new webapp does is use a template of these key pages, to combine with a bunch of market definitions (country code, language code, catalog id's etc) to produce a list of all those URL's that need to be hit. By hitting them all in an asynchronous way it not only runs faster (now taking only 90 seconds), it also does a better job of proportioning the JVM, uses up to 30 threads and opens the JDBC pool to its full number of connections. Thus it's REALLY in a production-like state by the time we let traffic on. So I am very pleased with results, but this browser freeze is annoying me from a purely cosmetic and puzzle-solving point of view.    
 
 p So now some code, the user simply selects an appserver, the app decides which cluster it is from, and displays the list of computed URL's it will hit. At this point the page is a table of 'Markets x Urls' with each cell having a unique id that the jquery uses to put the right result in the right cell (as we can't guarantee the order in which the results come back - nor do we want to as that takes us back into synchronous territory again.    
 
 p So at the point at which the user is ready to click Go, the table is written and the jQuery commands prepared. On clicking go the jquery script is executed and URL's are hit and return a HTTP status code for each so we know they were successful.    
 
 p The JQ part generated looks like (shortened to just a few markets)

 p  code SET CHLAUTH(TEST_CHANNEL) TYPE(ADDRESSMAP) ADDRESS(*) MCAUSER('mq-user') /code     
 
 p Says the following:    
 
 ul  
 li For connections requesting  code TEST_CHANNEL /code ... /li  
 li Originating from  em any /em  IP address... /li  
 li Set the MCAUSER to  code mq-user /code  /li  
 /ul  
 
 p In other words, enable the channel such that any connections inherit the privileges of  code mq-user /code  regardless of where they originate and what identity they present.  So the behavior you are seeing is the expected behavior based on the  code CHLAUTH /code  rule above.    
 
 p There are a few other problems with the rules as listed:    
 
 ul  
 li The use of  code PRINCIPAL /code  rather than  code GROUP /code .  On non-windows servers if you specify  code PRINCIPAL /code  what happens is that the QMgr looks up that ID, queries its primary group and then sets authorizations based on that.  So if  code mq-users /code  has a primary group of  code staff /code  or  code users /code  that that is what gets authorized instead of  code mq-users /code  and is probably not what you intended.  Always use  code group /code  so that you get the result you intend with  code setmqaut /code  or  code AUTHREC /code . /li  
 li Granting  code ALL /code  on the QMgr makes the ID/group administrative.  One of the privileges at the QMgr level is  code SET /code  and any user in a group with  code SET /code  rights can set, among other things, authorization control lists.  So even though you only granted  code AUTHADD(INQ,DSP,PUT) /code  the  code mq-users /code  ID can submit PCF commands to grant all access to all objects.  Only grant  code CONNECT /code  and  code INQUIRE /code  on the QMgr if that's all you need.  /li  
 li There's an assumption stated (in bold, actually) that you would have expected to be required to pass user credentials.  Please be aware that WMQ does not validate a user ID and password if you do provide them.  It accepts the ID that you assert.  The password field is available to exits which can be used to validate the ID and password against, for example, LDAP or the local OS.  Such an exit can be purchased from a 3rd party or written but base WMQ doesn't do anything with the password.  Had you specified  code USERSRC(CHANNEL) /code  on the mapping, then your ID would have been used and most likely rejected.  But the rejection would have been either because it is in the  code mqm /code  group (which is blocked by a default  code CHLAUTH /code  rule) or because there are no  code AUTHREC /code  records for the group it is in. /li  
 /ul  
 
 p For more about hardening WMQ, there are a number of resources collected  a href="http://t-rob.net/links" rel="nofollow" here /a .  The  em Hardening WebSphere MQ /em  presentation is from v7.0.  Although v7.1 has new controls, the principals remain the same:    
 
 ul  
 li Authenticate the connection using IP filtering (for apps or QMgrs where the connection originates in a locked datacenter), SSL/TLS and/or an exit /li  
 li Map the authenticated identity to an  code MCAUSER /code  value by hard-coding it in the channel or by using an exit or  code CHLAUTH /code  rule to dynamically set it /li  
 li Administrative connections and high-value applications should be authenticated using TLS  /li

Since WMQ Explorer needs to display all objects of all object types it is a bit more permissive than you are asking for.  However, the settings you need are a subset of the ones Dale provides and the post has a lot of good background on the configurations used.  I could copy his  code setmqaut /code  commands here but its worth reading the post.    
 
 p Incidentally, if you have a v7.1 QMgr and a new WMQ Explorer (downloaded from  a href="http://ibm.co/SupptPacMS0T" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MS0T /a ) there's a security wizard in WMQ Explorer that makes the same settings Dale recommends in his blog post.

 p Correct me if I am wrong, but you also have to specify your custom MQ client libraries in Manifest of your WAR file. You only mentioned Log4J. It should look somehting like this:

<value columnNumber="1"> p I finally have it working. I'll document my steps in case anyone else runs into similar problems deploying a Play app on WebSphere in the future.    
 
 p 1 - The first issue was the 404. Websphere doesn't pass requests for root (/) to the app to handle (wtf?), so the fix is to define a similar route in your routes file:    
 
 pre  code GET    /*    Application.index 
 /code   re  
 
 p instead of (or on top of)    
 
 pre  code GET    /    Application.index 
 /code   re  
 
 p 2 - The next issue was errors related to persistence (JPA) methods not existing. Play uses JPA 2.0, while WebSphere 7 uses their own custom version of OpenJPA 1.0. You can install  a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/was/featurepacks/" rel="nofollow" a feature pack for JPA 2 and OSGI /a  (you don't need the OSGI part, so it can be ignored). Note that the feature pack requires that you have WebSphere 7.0.0.9 or later installed. That means matching fix packs for both the app server and the bundled JDK. I.E. fix pack 21 (the latest at the time or writing) for both the server and the JDK need to be installed first before installing the JPA feature pack. At the end of the feature pack installation, it will ask you if you want to run the profile tool. Say yes. This tool will let you "augment" your profile (the server node you're going to install your war on). Augment away!    
 
 p 3 - Build a war file that will work in WebSphere:    
 
 pre  code play war   appFolder  -o   outputFolder  --zip --%prod 
 /code   re  
 
 p This will create a folder named  (an exploded war) and a .war file named .war, with the app id set to prod. The exploded war can be deleted.    
 
 p Running this command on linux keeps putting my WEB-INF folder inside an unnamed folder (so, down a level from the root level of the war file). In other words, instead of /WEB-INF/, it's creating a structure like //WEB-INF/. Anyway, I'm fixing it manually for now, by re-zipping it properly. Anyone know how to avoid this problem?    
 
 p 4 - Install the war file into WebSphere with all the default settings in the admin console...or tweak them if you know what you're doing.    
 
 p 5 - I'm not entirely sure if this step is necessary (doesn't change anything for my particular app), but all the advice I've read online about getting Play apps to run in WebSphere say to do this. Meh, it can't hurt. Click on your installed app. Click on the "Class loading and update detection" link. Then select the "Classes loaded with local class loader first (parent last)" option. Ok. Save.    
 
 p 6 - Open a browser page to your address (localhost:9080 if running websphere locally), and test. At this point it should work! Hopefully. Good luck.

 p  em Use the dot character  code . /code  as a separator. /em  br  
Authorization rules parse names using dot characters as separators.  For example, the queue name  code MY.EXAMPLE.QUEUE.NAME /code  would match rules like  code MY.*.*.* /code  or  code MY.** /code  but not  code MY.* /code  because the dots signify name node separator characters.  Do yourself a favor and use dots rather than underscores as your naming node separators consistently.    
 
 p  em Use machine-parsable names. /em  br  
When you have 5 queue managers and a few hundred objects, you can easily get by doing all your management manually with WMQ Explorer or runmqsc.  However, there comes a point where consistency, reliability, repeatability and efficiency demand that you script up some of your routine operations or employ instrumentation to respond to network events. More than anything else this means eliminating ambiguity in names.    
 
 p For example, if you create a naming convention that channel names must look like  code SRCQMGR.DESTQMGR /code  then it is possible for a script to read a  code RCVR /code  or  code SDR /code  channel name and derive the names of the two queue managers it connects.  However, what does the script do with a channel name like  code GA.PAYROLL.OPS /code ?  Is it the  code GA.PAYROLL /code  queue manager connecting to the  code OPS /code  queue manager?  Or is it the  code GA /code  queue manager connecting to the  code PAYROLL.OPS /code  queue manager? A human might be able to tell instantly based on context but scripts are notorious for doing what you tell them rather than what you intended. Similar situations arise when queue names have position-dependent qualifiers at both the beginning and the end of the name and a variable number of nodes.    
 
 p  em Stick with UPPERCASE names. /em  br  
This is for compatibility across all platforms, and in particular z/OS.  Although it is true that more z/OS shops are using mixed case, it is also true that there are still a lot of systems out there that only accept UPPERCASE names.  While it is easy to say "this doesn't apply to me" I have seen many cases where somebody had problems interfacing to a new business partner because of incompatible names.  After all, the ability to interface to just about any platform out there is one of the main reasons for using WMQ in the first place.    
 
 p  em Don't include attributes of the object in the name /em  br  
In an SOA world, queues and topics are different types of destination and often are interchangeable.  Something putting messages to what it thinks is a queue doesn't necessarily know (or care!) if they are actually going to a queue or a topic.  A queue that has an application listening on it for messages may be fed by an administrative subscription that is actually roping in publications from one or more topics.    
 
 p What we really care about is the nature of the messages - what function do they perform - not whether we are connecting to a local queue or an alias queue.  So adding qualifiers like  code .QA /code ,  code .QL /code ,  code .TPC /code  (for topic) and so forth doesn't make sense.  Similarly, adding  code .RCVR /code  onto a channel name sucks up 5 useful characters that could have been better used describing the QMgr name.  Worse, these practices bake the topology into the object names, making the system both less flexible and more brittle.    
 
 p  strong Channel names /strong     
 
 p  em Point-to-Point Channel names /em  br  
Use names like  code SRCQMGR.DESTQMGR /code  for  code RCVR /code ,  code RQSTR /code ,  code SDR /code , and  code SVR /code  channels. This is biased toward languages that read left-to-right because the intention is to describe the data flow  em from /em  a QMgr  em to /em  another QMgr    
 
 p  em Cluster channels /em  br  
Use names like  code CLUSNAME.QMNAME /code .  The old wisdom said to use names like  code TO.QMNAME /code  but if you ever implement overlapping clusters this causes the same channel to be used for multiple clusters.  That's bad because you can then never perform maintenance on one cluster without impacting the other.  Using  code CLUSNAME.QMNAME /code  insures that every QMgr has a dedicated  code CLUSRCVR /code  channel for each cluster in which it participates.    
 
 p  em Client Channels /em  br  
The exception to the "don't include attributes of the object in the name" is arguably the  code SVRCONN /code  channel.  This is because channels are very much tied to the physical rather than the logical layer of the network.  So putting the QMgr name in a SVRCONN channel name is generally OK.  I don't object too strongly if people want to add  code .SVRCONN /code  at the end, either.    
 
 p The thing to remember about client channels is that if you use a Client Channel Definition Table (CCDT) then the unique index into that table is the channel name.  That means you cannot have the same channel name on multiple QMgrs and still use a CCDT.  Since the CCDT is one way to configure the SSL/TLS channel details, this is often not appreciated to its fullest until the "let's finally secure WMQ" project comes along.  By using unique channel names for  code SVRCONN /code  channels from the start, you can future-proof the network.  Usually these names look like  code APP.QMNAME /code  or to make it obvious you aren't dealing with a cluster or point-to-point channel,  code APP.QMNAME.SVRCONN /code  or similar.    
 
 p  strong Queue manager names /strong     
 
 p  em No dots in QMgr names /em  br  
One implication of the previous rules is that cluster and queue manager names must contain only one node and therefore should never contain a  code . /code  character.  This is because channel names are typically derived from the cluster and/or QMgr names.  So in the example above, a  code RCVR /code  channel name like  code GA_PAYROLL.OPS /code  would tell both humans and scripts that the channel in question connects a QMgr named  code GA_PAYROLL /code  to a QMgr named  code OPS /code .    
 
 p  em Names of 9 chars or less /em  br  
Channel names can be only 20 characters.  Subtract one for the dot separator, divide by two and round down gets you to 9 characters max for queue managers.  If there's a possibility that you may set up different channels for classes of service (for large vs small messages, for example, then drop back to 8 chars or less for QMgr names.  This leads to  code QM1.QM2.A /code ,  code QM1.QM2.B /code , etc.    
 
 p  em QMgr names reflect the physical layer /em  br  
In a service-oriented world, we really care about destination names like queues and topics.  We care much less about queue manager names because these are just life support for queues and topics.  Client apps don't care so much about  em which /em  QMgr the connect to, so long as they can send requests and receive replies.  WMQ very conveniently fills in the reply-to QMgr name on outbound requests so it is rare that an application needs to know about it.    
 
 p On the other hand, the administrators need to know about the QMgr name.  In the early days it was common to name QMgrs for the host server.  Later it became the fashion to name them for the applications they hosted. Now in the SOA world, messaging is infrastructure and usually not associated with any single application so the pendulum has swung back. Give the QMgr a unique name that is meaningful to an administrator.    
 
 p  em Never reuse QMgr names! /em  br  
It is unfortunately very common to "move" a QMgr from one place to another or to have a primary and disaster recovery QMgr with the same name.  This practice usually means some part of the application is dependent on the QMgr name and therefore it is "easier" to reuse the name.  IBM introduced the  code QMID /code  as a way to address some of the problems introduced by reusing QMgr names.  The typical use case is that a node gets rebuilt and the QMgr once there is also rebuilt from scratch.  The cluster knows it is a new QMgr because the  code QMID /code  has changed, but the name used for routing and other operations remains the same.    
 
 p Although this helped in that limited use case, it doesn't address the issues when both QMgrs with the same name are online at the same time.  Nor does it address the problem that a reputable Certificate Authority won't issue multiple certs with the same Distinguished Name which forces reuse of the same certificate for multiple QMgrs.    
 
 p Remember that QMgrs are just life support for queues and topics and ideally will be anonymous to the applications using them. Pick a naming convention that allows you to spin up new QMgrs with unique names by the hundreds or thousands, if necessary, so that you don't have to reuse QMgr names.    
 
 p  strong Other objects /strong       
 
 p  em Use intention-revealing names /em  br  
Or to put it another way, name the object for what it  em does /em  and not what it  em is /em .  For example, if you were in the habit (as many people are) of including qualifiers like  code .QL /code  for local queues and  code .QA /code  for aliases, then any change in topology will impact the applications using those queues.  Instead, name the queues for the functions they represent.    
 
 p  em Go left-to-right, most generic to most specific /em  br  
Object names, especially queues, should be constructed hierarchically beginning with the most generic qualifier and proceeding to the most specific qualifier.  For example, many shops use  code APP.FUNC.SUBFUNC.VER /code  where  code APP /code  is the ID of the owning application, then one or more nodes with the function and subfunction.  Many shops add a version qualifier on the end so that new versions of a service can migrate their clients on separate schedules rather than changing the service on the existing queue and making all clients change at the same time.    
 
 p  em The thing that reads the messages owns the queue /em  br  
If I have a service endpoint represented by a queue then there is a many-to-one relationship between the things that might call the service to the thing that provides the service.  The queue is associated with the service and the thing providing that service.  Clients are more or less anonymous.  Therefore, if any of the stakeholder applications can be said to "own" the queue, it is the service provider app that consumes messages form it.    
 
 p  em The thing that publishes the message owns the topic.  Sort of. /em  br  
The relationship is not as straightforward with topics.  Here it is the consumers of messages that are usually anonymous.  In that sense if the topic name reflects any application, it is most likely the publisher.  However, even publishers can be anonymous, or at least there may many of them and not all publishing at the same time.  With topics it makes much more sense that the topic tree nodes are structured for the hierarchy of data or functionality they represent.  These names tend to match the names of the publishing apps so sometimes the publisher "owns" the topic as much out of coincidence as anything else.    
 
 p  em Put positional qualifiers on the left /em  br  
Where names have variable numbers of qualifiers, put the positional ones on the left where scripts and automation can parse them.  Some shops where both the beginning  em and /em  ending qualifiers are positional deal with this by using underscores for separators in the variable section of the name like  code APP.FUNC.SUBFUNC1_SUBFUNC2.VER /code .  Scripts and authorizations then always see a fixed number of nodes in the name but this approach can be brittle if somebody forgets and makes a name with an extra node or two.

 p I have different kinds of servers. However, they are all in the same DefaultCoreFroup. By my understanfing, I can seperate them to different CoreGroups, according to type. Yet, I understand that this seperation can be good if I want High Availability possibilities. I am not using the WebSphere High Availability possibilities.    
 
 p However, I have noticed that occassionally, on WebSphere 6.1 a server on startup shows messages of DCS stack and that it cannot get in touch with another server in its CoreGroup, and so it is stuck that way, until that other Server is restarted / shutodwn or whatever.    
 
 p If I seperate the two to different CoreGroup, the problem doens't happen. However, I want to know if this is what they meant to do in WebSphere or is this a bug in WAS v6.1 and may have been resolved in WAS v7.0

JAX-WS does not allow session sharing between the client 
BindingProvider instances for synchronous proxy invocations. 
JAX-RPC did allow session cookie sharing between clients. 
 /code   re  
 
 p  strong Problem conclusion /strong     
 
 p The JAX-WS synchronous proxy code was corrected and now 
supports session sharing between client BindingProvider 
instances.    
 
 p JAX-WS allows client applications to copy session cookies from 
one BindingProvider's request context and put it on another 
BindingProvider instance's request context to effectively 
share a session.    
 
 p The fix for this APAR is currently targeted for inclusion in 
fixpack 6.1.0.25 and 7.0.0.1.  Please refer to the Recommended

Is there any meta data that can help me understand the origin of the message or do I have to create a backout queue for each queue for that?    
 
 p The "backout queue for every queue" is to simplify the question and not a real use case. br

My understanding of your answer here is that in the case I have multiple queues that require backout queue (from business point of view). I can take two paths: br

 p The script I am using does not call a webservice, but directly connects and reads the WebSphere queue.  However, in order to do this, I have to add a reference to amqmdnet.dll.    
 
 p You can add a reference to a Script  strong Task /strong  (which sits on the Control Flow canvas), but not to a Script  strong Component /strong  (which is part of the Data Flow).    
 
 p So I have a Script Task, with reference and code to read the contents of the queue.  Each line in the queue is just a fixed width record, and each is added to a List.  At the end, the List is put into a Read/Write object variable declared at the package level.    
 
 p The Script feeds into a Data Flow task.  The first component of the Data Flow is a Script Component, created as Source, as billinkc describes above. This script casts the object variable back to a list.  Then parses each item in the list to fields in the Output Buffer. 
Various split and transform tasks take over from there.

that an out-of-the-box solution is just not possible. So my question is, do the applications build with the said frameworks vary so much 
from business to business, that it's not possible to reuse them?    /li

Suppliers as they come? (this is the way  a href="http://www.hubspan.com" rel="nofollow" HubSpan /a  did it, not counting the developing of custom Connectors to the Client ERP systems). 
Or will I have to do a separate integration for each Customer?    /li  
 li  p How much work hours is required to complete a typical integration project, (assuming everything is planned and executed properly)? 
(For the sake of simplicity, let's say that the integration includes only 'Query Product Price', 'Query Product Availability', 
and 'Purchase Order Management'.     /li  
 li  p And finally, is this a job for a sigle person (can I do this myself?, assuming I have the knowledge to do it) or a team is required?    /li

 p NodeJS is something new in Web after Ajax (just a name as it was hyped after Comet cleaner. Technique itself was used earlier). It doesn't replace it.

 p You should be able to disable from the WAS solutions console. Mine is

 p Add the -Xdump:system:... settings you wish to the existing arguments being careful not to mess up the existing syntax. Depending on what is causing the crash you could remove that from the events= portion. Probably gpf is the cause. You can look at line 1TISIGINFO in the .txt files that accompany the .dmp files. I have a few that say Dump Event "gpf".    
 
 p You may be able to set these settings on the WAS server properties in RAD as well but I couldn't find anything there.    
 
 p Of course, you are just covering up the problem by doing this, but at least you will not have to endure the .dmp file writing while you are trying to find the problem.

   p All messages sent from JMS have unique message identifiers assigned by WebSphereÂ® MQ. The value assigned is returned in the MQMD messageId field after the MQPUT call, and is passed back to the application in the JMSMessageID field. The WebSphere MQ messageId is a 24-byte binary value, whereas the JMSMessageID is a string. The JMSMessageID is composed of the binary messageId value converted to a sequence of 48 hexadecimal characters,  strong prefixed with the characters ID: /strong . JMS provides a hint that can be set to disable the production of message identifiers. This hint is ignored, and a unique identifier is assigned in all cases. Any value that is set into the JMSMessageId field before a send() is overwritten.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I have EAR with one web application inside. In this web application I get a data source reference through JNDI. So I have a JDBC type resource reference in my web.xml:      
 
 pre  code   resource-ref  
      description TCCC Database  /description  
      res-ref-name jdbc/tccc  /res-ref-name  
      res-type javax.sql.DataSource  /res-type  
      res-auth Container  /res-auth  
  /resource-ref    
 /code   re  
 
 p I have to deploy my EAR to  strong WebSphere App Server 7.0 /strong  and for my resource reference (jdbc/tccc) I must specify a JNDI name in order to bind this logical name to the physical location of the DB resource.      
 
 p I successfully set up and configured a JDBC provider, data source and security settings on my WAS instance according to the documentation. And using web administration console I've deployed my EAR binding manually on some step HOST and JNDI so that  strong ibm-web-bnd.xml /strong  looks like:    
 
 p  code   virtual-host name="default_host"  
  resource-ref name="jdbc/tccc" br  
binding-name="jdbc/tccc/oracle "  
 /code       
 
 p Where â€œjdbc/tccc/oracleâ€� is a JNDI name for the datasource that I configured on WAS. 
Everything is working fine.      
 
 p But now I want to do all deployment just by using  strong ws_ant /strong  and appropriate tasks like InstallApplication, UninstallApplication etc. I've created an appropriate build.xml file with needed tasks and now can uninstall and install my app. But how can I bind app JNDI name to JNDI name of datasource on server. Using defaultBindings task I can bind host to default_host. How I can achieve the same with JNDI. I've been trying to set defaultDataSource argument in defaultBindings task but it always creates ibm-web-bnd.xml with the same binding-name value:      
 
 p  code   virtual-host name="default_host"  
  resource-ref name="jdbc/tccc" br  
binding-name="jdbc/tccc "  /code       
 
 p Importang thing: I have to bind resource reference only  strong during deployment /strong  to bind to different datasources in future.

 ol  
 li Expose the methods in the "other WAR" using something like Remote EJBs or SOAP/REST services. /li  
 li Store the data in a cache that is visible to both WARs. If you use JBoss, then JBoss Cache could meet your needs. /li

<value columnNumber="1"> p The EJB specification requires that the container schedule "catch up" timer events if it's unable to fire a timer because it was already running.  In practice, containers probably recalculate the next fire time after the method has completed, and then immediately re-execute if the next fire time is "before" the current time.  I know this is how WebSphere Application Server works.    
 
 p Note that the default  code ConcurrencyManagement(ConcurrencyManagemementType.CONTAINER) /code  for the bean and  code Lock(LockType.WRITE) /code  for the timer method will prevent any other methods from being executed.  If you need other methods on that bean, you might consider using  code ConcurrencyManagementType.BEAN /code .

<value columnNumber="0">9626844</value>
<value columnNumber="1"> p Channels are expected to go down.  The idea is that they stay active as long as there is traffic and then time out.  Assuming they've been configured to trigger, the presence of a message on the XMitQ causes the channel to start up again.      
 
 p The reason for this is that a triggered channel will generally restart if interrupted by a network failure or other adverse event.  However if a channel is configured to stay running 24x7 then the only way it stops is due to one of these adverse events and that increases the likelihood that human intervention will be required to restart the channel. On the other hand, a channel that times out can survive all sorts of nasty network events that occur while it is inactive.  Allowing it to time out when not in use thus improves overall reliability of the channel.    
 
 p So how do you cause a channel to trigger?  Make sure the transmission queue contains the  code TRIGGER /code ,  code TRIGTYPE /code ,  code TRIGDATA /code  and  code INITQ /code  attributes.  For example, to define a transmission queue to the  code JUPITER /code  QMgr:    
 
 pre  code DEF QL(JUPITER) + 
    USAGE(XMITQ) + 
    TRIGGER + 
    TRIGTYPE(FIRST) + 
    TRIGDATA('MYQMGR.JUPITER') + 
    INITQ(SYSTEM.CHANNEL.INITQ) + 
    REPLACE 
 /code   re  
 
 p The only variable of the bunch is  code TRIGDATA /code  which contains the name of the channel serving this XMitQ.    
 
 p Of course, the channel initiator must be running but in modern versions of WMQ it starts by default (based on the value of the queue manager's  code SCHINIT /code  attribute) so generally  em will /em  in fact be running.    
 
 p The channel that is in  code STOPPED /code  state cannot be triggered.  By default the  code STOP CHL /code  command uses  code STATUS(STOPPED) /code  so most of the time manually stopping a channel prevents triggering.  If you want to stop a channel in such a way that it will restart (for example to test triggering) use the  code STOP CHL(CHLNAME) STATUS(INACTIVE) /code  command.  If the channel is already in  code STOPPED /code  state, either issue the  code START CHL /code  command to make it start immediately or use the  code STOP CHL(CHLNAME) STATUS(INACTIVE) /code  to change the status from  code STOPPED /code  to  code INACTIVE /code  without starting it.    
 
 p Once the channels are up, the  code DISCINT /code  attribute of the channel determines how long it will run before timing out.  The value is in seconds and defaults to 600 which is 10 minutes.  The  code DISCINT /code ,  code KAINT /code  and  code HBINT /code  combine to determine when the channel comes down.  Note that the TCP spec calls for things using keepalive to disable them by default so if you want to use keepalive on your channels, you  em must /em  enable it in the QMgr tuning as described  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.mq.doc/cs13390_.htm" rel="nofollow" here /a .    
 
 p Please see  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.mq.doc/ic10580_.htm" rel="nofollow" Triggering Channels /a  in the Infocenter for more on the configuration details.   Take a look at  a href="http://ibm.co/SupptPacMD0C" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MD0C /a   em WebSphere MQ - Keeping Channels Up and Running /em  if you want to know more about the internals and tuning. (The SupportPac is a bit dated but the principles of tuning mostly still apply. Where there are discrepancies, the Infocenter is the authoritative version.)    
 
 p If you want to keep channels up continuously, set  code DISCINT(0) /code  but remember that triggering remains the preferred option.  Some shops need to minimize response times during the business day and so set  code DISCINT /code  to a value that allows the channels to time out at night but generally keeps them running all day.  If for some reason you have triggering set up right and the channels go down prior to  code DISCIINT /code  you should be able to check in the error logs for the reason why.  These reside in the QMgr's directory under  code errors /code .  For example, on UNIX/Linux they are in  code /var/mqm/qmgrs/qmgrname/errors /code  and on Windows the default location is  code C:\Program Files(x86)\WebSphere MQ\QMgrs\qmgrname\errors /code .  Look for the files named  code AMQERR??.LOG /code  where  code ?? /code  =  code 01 /code ,  code 02 /code , or  code 03 /code .  The logs rotate where  code 01 /code  is current,  code 02 /code  is next and so on.  If you have a very busy QMgr you need to capture these as soon as the channel goes down or they could roll off.

 p I know many, many moons ago, JBoss used to have the idea of a "Universal ClassLoader".  Basically, all JARs/EARs/WARs were loaded in one big pool.  The problem is that a lot of time the code needed different versions of the same JAR, and they were not always compatible.  Also, there technically a security risk if someone drops a "custom" class/JAR into the mix ahead of yours.  I think it was around JBoss 3.5 that they switched away from the Universal ClassLoader, as I remember our app needed a LOT of work to fix things up to work right.

 p You should preferably not explicitly map to the container's default servlet in any way. You're not only tight coupling your webapp to the specific container, but until about one year ago, there was also a huge security hole when doing that in Tomcat and clones (JBoss, WebSphere, etc). It enables the attackers to request files (containing possibly sensitive information) in  code /WEB-INF /code  and  code /META-INF /code  whenever the default servlet was mapped on a different URL pattern than  code / /code .

   p Rewriting rules define how the proxy server rewrites URLs. Responses 
  that have been redirected by target servers typically return  a 302 
  status code with a location header that defines the URL that the 
  client should be redirected to. Rewriting this URL is necessary if the 
  target server is not aware of the proxy servers. The redirected URL is 
  modified to correctly point clients to the proxy server instead of  
  directly to a target server that may not be visible to clients. Use 
  the following properties to configure the URL rewriting rules for a  
  proxy server    
   
   p Avoid trouble: The proxy server only supports rewriting redirected 
  responses. Therefore, these the following settings only apply to 
  redirected responses. These settings do not apply to requests because 
  the proxy server does not support URL rewriting for requests.

<value columnNumber="1"> p The jar and context factory mentioned would tend to indicate that the WMQ client was borrowed from a WebSphere Application Server install rather than using the stand-alone WMQ client installer.  If that is the case you can likely fix this quite easily by installing the stand-alone client.  You can obtain this free (with registration) as a SupportPac.  These are by version so you have your choice of:    
 
 ul  
 li V7.1 client is  a href="http://ibm.co/SupptPacMQC71" rel="nofollow" SupportPacMQC71 /a  (Preferred) /li  
 li V7.0 client is  a href="http://ibm.co/SupptPacMQC7" rel="nofollow" SupportPacMQC7 /a  /li  
 li V6.0 client is  a href="http://ibm.co/SupptPacMQC6" rel="nofollow" SupportPacMQC6 /a  (Out of support as of September 2012) /li  
 /ul  
 
 p Note that installing the client from the IBM-supplied installer provides a number of additional features such as diagnostics for tracing, version display, initial verification test code, sample source code, etc.  This is the method of install that IBM will support so even though you can get it to work by copying the jars from the WMQ server install, using IBM's media is recommended.    
 
 p Note also that the packaging of the Java and JMS classes has changed between versions.  It is important to know which version that you are using and refer to the corresponding docs for  code CLASSPATH /code  and other config options.  The v7.1 implementation has many functional improvements and is the only version that will take advantage of the features on a v7.1 QMgr.  However it will connect to  em any /em  version QMgr so if this is new development, try to use the v7.1 client now so that you don't end up needing to upgrade down the road.    
 
 p The Infocenter links for each version of the client are:

<value columnNumber="1"> p  strong Background: /strong     
 
 p I have a requirement that messages displayed to the user must vary both by language and by company division.  Thus, I can't use out of the box resource bundles, so I'm essentially writing my own version of resource bundles using PropertiesConfiguration files.    
 
 p In addition, I have a requirement that messages must be modifiable dynamically in production w/o doing restarts.    
 
 p I'm loading up three different iterations of property files:    
 
 pre  code -basename_division.properties 
-basename_2CharLanguageCode.properties 
-basename.properties 
 /code   re  
 
 p These files exist in the classpath.  This code is going into a tag library to be used by multiple portlets in a Portal.    
 
 p I construct the possible .properties files, and then try to load each of them via the following:    
 
 pre  code PropertiesConfiguration configurationProperties; 
try { 
    configurationProperties = new PropertiesConfiguration(propertyFileName); 
    configurationProperties.setReloadingStrategy(new FileChangedReloadingStrategy()); 
} catch (ConfigurationException e) { 
    /* This is ok -- it just means that the specific configuration file doesn't  
       exist right now, which will often be true. */ 
    return(null); 
} 
 /code   re  
 
 p If it did successfully locate a file, it saves the created PropertiesConfiguration into a hashmap for reuse, and then tries to find the key.  (Unlike regular resource bundles, if it doesn't find the key, it then tries to find the more general file to see if the key exists in that file -- so that only override exceptions need to be put into language/division specific property files.)    
 
 p  strong The Problem: /strong     
 
 p If a file did not exist the first time it was checked, it throws the expected exception.  However, if at a later time a file is then later dropped into the classpath and this code is then re-run, the exception is still thrown.  Restarting the portal obviously clears the problem, but that's not useful to me -- I need to be able to allow them to drop new messages in place for language/companyDivision overrides w/o a restart.  And I'm not that interested in creating blank files for all possible divisions, since there are quite a few divisions.    
 
 p I'm assuming this is a classLoader issue, in that it determines that the file did not exist in the classpath the first time, and caches that result when trying to reload the same file.  I'm not interested in doing anything too fancy w/ the classLoader.  (I'd be the only one who would be able to understand/maintain that code.)  The specific environment is WebSphere Portal.    
 
 p Any ways around this or am I stuck?

<value columnNumber="1"> p This need may sound a little convoluted, and if so, then I am open to suggestions as to best practices for implementation.  My problem is the following.  I have a WAR webapp, which is contained within an EAR.  Everything is mavenized.  From within my webapp, I am trying to show the artifact ids and version numbers of the ear and the war.    
 
 p The war is a fairly easy case to handle.  I can use simple maven filtering to inject the necessary artifactId/versionId into the war as it is being built.  The ear, however is more complicated.    
 
 p I know there is a META-INF/maven// om.properties that I can look at in the ear which contains that information, but I cannot see to access it.    
 
 p I've tried (from within a jsp page) the following without success (all with and without leading /); all calls return null:    
 
 pre  code getClass().getClassLoader().getResource( "/META-INF/maven/  group /  artifact  om.properties"); 
getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream( "/META-INF/maven/  group /  artifact  om.properties"); 
 /code   re  
 
 p Is this even feasible using the classloader?  Or is it classloader configuration dependent?  Is there a better approach to get this information?    
 
 p I'm currently running tests on JBoss, but the final deployment will be on WebSphere.  However, ideally I would like a solution that is not server dependent.

 p The No-Op rollback happens only with slf4j -1.6+ so anything older than that will throw an exception and halts your deployment.    
 
 p There is a documentation in  a href="http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder" rel="nofollow" SLf4J site /a  to resolve this. I followed that and added  code slf4j-simple-1.6.1.jar /code  to my aplication along with  code slf4j-api-1.6.1.jar /code  which i already had.

<value columnNumber="1"> p This indicates that there's a conflict with another JSF implementation in the webapp's runtime classpath. Full fledged Java EE application servers like JBoss AS, Glassfish, WebSphere, Weblogic, etc already ship with JSF bundled since that's part of the Java EE API. If you supply JSF in your webapp's  code /WEB-INF/lib /code  as well, it may conflict with the appserver-bundled JSF. The JSF API part will be loaded from the appserver-provided JSF libraries, but the JSF impl part will be loaded from the webapp-provided JSF libraries. If they are of a different version, then you'll get configuration errors like this.    
 
 p You have 2 options:    
 
 ol  
 li  p Remove the webapp-bundled JSF and rely on the server-bundled JSF.    /li  
 li  p Tell the server to use webapp-bundled JSF instead. How to do that depends on the server make/version. In your particular case with JBoss 7.x, that would be a matter of adding the following context parameter to webapp's  code web.xml /code :    
 
 pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"  code   context-param  
      param-name org.jboss.jbossfaces.WAR_BUNDLES_JSF_IMPL   aram-name  
      param-value true   aram-value  
  /context-param   
 /code   re  /li  
 /ol  
 
 p Barebones JSP/Servlet containers like Tomcat, Jetty, etc doesn't ship with JSF bundled, that's why you would need to provide your own JSF libraries in  code /WEB-INF/lib /code  when targeting such containers.

 li Interoperable /li  
 li Loosely coupled /li  
 /ul  
 
 p A company offers a lot of business services (coarse-grained) developed over many years and exposed to the users (human or other systems) in some form. There are more chances that each of these features have been designed and developed not keeping the above three principles in mind. Moreover, each of those features might be running on disparate heterogeneous platforms, using different technologies etc.    
 
 p What if you want to integrate these disparate features thus creating new solutions (For e.g. Amazon store front is a new service composed of their catalog service, shopping cart service etc)?    
 
 p You have two choices:     
 
 ol  
 li Building the new feature from scratch keeping the 3 principles in mind. But it is a very costly endeavor, and one thatâ€™s almost never successful.  /li  
 li An effective and less risky alternative is to assemble/compose it from existing, proven (well tested) services.  /li  
 /ol  
 
 p Option 2 is where  strong ESBs /strong  can help with their support for routing, transformation, monitoring etc.  strong  a href="http://camel.apache.org/" Apache Camel /a ,  a href="http://www.mulesoft.org/" Mule /a  /strong  are open-source ESB's. Endpoints  ;amp; Routes are the terminology used in EIP ( a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/toc.html" Enterprise Integration Patterns /a ) that these ESB's implement. ESB's can take help of  strong MOM's /strong  when they want to route/integrate services that are running on heterogeneous platforms (For e.g. the catalog service might be running on a mainframe system but the shopping cart is implemented using  strong stateful EJBs /strong  running in a Java Application server).  strong Message queue /strong  is a concept in MOM that acts a temporary storage of the message between the sender and receiver. This temporary storage provides lot of benefits like asynchronous delivery, guaranteed delivery etc. Now, there can me multiple MOM vendors like IBM (WebSphere MQ), open-source ActiveMQ etc. We can use  strong JMS /strong  to keep your code independent of the vendor.    
 
 p I tried to relate all the concepts with an example. I also tried to keep it short. Please  
ask follow up questions to gain more understanding.

<value columnNumber="1"> p You may be thinking of the Web Tools Platform (WTP) from eclipse. MyEclipse integrates much of the functionality of WTP but has a different way of configuring and deploying to servers. The MyEclipse servers view tab is called "Servers", the WTP servers view tab is called "WTP Servers". Double clicking on a server in WTP Servers will bring up an editor window of the type you describe. In the MyEclipse Servers view, you can bring up the configuration dialog by right clicking on the server and selecting "Configure Server Connector".    
 
 p In base MyEclipse, you don't have the option of setting ports and security from the server connector, for WebSphere. However, if you switch to the Blue Edition of MyEclipse (more money, though), you do get more extensive configuration capability for WebSphere. I'm not sure what options you have in base MyEclipse; if you can find VM arguments (setting system properties) that provide what you want, you can set these on the JDK page of the configuration screens or, if there are program arguments that can be set, these can be added via a launch configuration, which you can create from the server connector configuration pages (and can modify them by going to the Run Configurations (which can also be reached by right clicking on the server in the Servers view).    
 
 p Hope this helps. For better support, the MyEclipse forums (on their web site) are your best option.

<value columnNumber="1"> p No, base WebSphere MQ does not directly transfer files.  The semantics for moving files include such things as file names, directory paths, conversion of names across different types of filesystem (i.e. a UNIX filetree versus a z/OS Partitioned Dataset).  Messaging uses semantics specific to queues and topics and these are drastically different from those for files.    
 
 p Accordingly, base WMQ does not attempt to perform file semantics as part of its core functionality.  The  a href="http://ibm.co/WMQFTE" rel="nofollow" WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition /a  and  a href="http://ibm.co/INdXGf" rel="nofollow" IBM Sterling Connect:Direct /a  provide that functionality.  In the case of FTE, managed file transfer is natively built on top of WebSphere MQ.    
 
 p Many people have in the past written solutions to move files using messaging, whether that's WebSphere MQ or another transport provider.  It turns out that doing so in a robust way is a non-trivial task.  Here are some of the issues:    
 
 ul  
 li If you make each file a single message then message sizes vary considerably.  It is very difficult to tune the messaging engine to simultaneously perform with very large and very small messages. /li  
 li If you break the files up into chunks then you cna tune chunk size for optimal messaging performance but now you must deal with sequence preservation and resend of missing messages. /li  
 li The general problem of whether to append, replace or rename a destination file with the same name. /li  
 li The general problem of how to make the file available at the destination in a transactional manner.  You don't want the recipient to grab half a file. /li  
 li File integrity (FTE hashes the file to insure it doesn't get changed in transit). /li  
 /ul  
 
 p These are a sampling of the issues to do this in a general-purpose way.  However if all you need is a one-time, point-to-point solution then have a look at  a href="http://ibm.co/SupptPacMA01" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MA01 /a , the Q program.  It will take files and either put a line at a time into a message or make the entire file a single message.  It can also be used as a pipe so it's possible to have two instances of Q where one pipes messages to a queue and the other retrieves them.

<value columnNumber="1"> p Take a look at the  a href="http://t-rob.net/links" rel="nofollow" Hardening WebSphere MQ /a  presentation for v7.0 and earlier.  The thing to remember is that WMQ does not authenticate anything.  It authorizes based on OS identities and groups but there is no password checking being done.    
 
 p For situations where QMgrs and clients live on Windows networks, the connection uses the SID and so it appears that some useful authentication was performed.  BUT if a connection from a non-Windows platform is attempted, the Windows QMgr uses the string representation of the ID.  So for example, if someone has a Linux VM on their desktop they can easily create a user ID called MUSR_MQADMIN and the Windows QMgr will accept the connection.  There is a setting that causes the Windows QMgr to only accept connections with SIDS that it can resolve but even there its just a matter of knowing what the SID values are to spoof them on a connection.    
 
 p The lesson here is that  strong any /strong  QMgr, even one on Windows, must be configured to authenticate remote connections.  With WMQ v7.1 and later, the QMgr has functionality to map X.509 certificate DNs to user IDs, or to perform IP filtering.  Prior to v7.1 these functions required an exit such as  a href="http://mrmq.dk" rel="nofollow" BlockIP2 /a .  Capitalware sells  a href="http://www.capitalware.biz/mqausx_overview.html" rel="nofollow" MQAUSX /a  which has the functions of BlockIP2, plus will perform ID and password authentication and is supported.    
 
 p The first recommendation is to use a v7.1 QMgr so that you get the  code CHLAUTH /code  rules for mapping and filtering.  Even if you don't use certificates v7.1 limits administrative connections so it is harder for an attacker to gain full admin rights.  Then if you need password validation, use SSL channels (to encrypt the password and prevent simply replay attacks) in combination with an exit that you can write yourself or purchase.    
 
 p Just be aware that allowing a connection from outside your domain doesn't present any new challenges.  The pre-v7.1 Windows QMgr that does not have MCAUSER set in the channel definition or by an exit allows remote administrative access, even from connections originating in the local Windows domain.  There was  em always /em  a need to harden that QMgr, even though honest users will have received authorization errors if the administrator did not set up auths for them.    
 
 p  strong Summary: /strong  br  
For clients originating outside your administrative domain, I'd recommend mutually authenticated TLS/SSL channels.  The same page I linked to above also contains the WMQ Security Lab guide and scripts which show how to script the creation and exchange of WMQ certs and configure WMQ Explorer with them.    
 
 p Whatever else you do, the  code MCAUSER /code  on any legitimate channel must be set either in the configuration or by an exit.  If the client is allowed to specify the ID, there is nothing to prevent it from specifying an administrative ID.  For channels that are NOT being used such as  code SYSTEM.DEF.* /code  and  code SYSTEM.AUTO.* /code , set the MCAUSER to a value that cannot be a local ID such as  code no!body /code  or on v7.1 and later  code *NOACCESS /code .

 p Web services client token cache for SAML    
 
 p When a SAML token is initially requested, the Web services runtime environment automatically saves the SAMLToken in the current javax.xml.ws.BindingProvider instance. As a result of this automatic client token caching function, subsequent Web services requests can use the SAMLToken from the previous request.  
The Web services client token cache for SAML enables Web services clients to reuse SAML tokens when accessing business services. Reusing valid SAML tokens reduces traffic to the Security Token Service (STS) and also reduces the performance impact of sending WS-Trust request messages.

 blockquote  
   p Thanks to the non-blocking I/O capability introduced in Java 4's New 
  I/O APIs for the Java Platform (NIO) package, a persistent HTTP 
  connection doesn't require that a thread be constantly attached to it. 
  Threads can be allocated to connections only when requests are being 
  processed. When a connection is idle between requests, the thread can 
  be recycled, and the connection is placed in a centralized NIO select 
  set to detect new requests without consuming a separate thread. This 
  model, called thread per request, potentially allows Web servers to 
  handle a growing number of user connections with a fixed number of 
  threads. With the same hardware configuration, Web servers running in 
  this mode scale much better than in the thread-per-connection mode. 
  Today, popular Web servers -- including Tomcat, Jetty, GlassFish 
  (Grizzly), WebLogic, and WebSphere -- all use thread per request 
  through Java NIO.

 p  a href="http:/ rogrammers.stackexchange.com/questions/145999/what-is-the-alternative-to-an-enterprise-portal-strategy-in-the-java-space" Same Question Reposted over at Programmers.StackExchange /a     
 
 p I'm trying to garner insight from as many sources as I can, and I wanted to hear from the big brains at Stackoverflow.    
 
 p  strong Disillusionment in the Portal Space /strong     
 
 p I'm seeing a disturbing number of large, enterprise clients who have become disillusioned with their enterprise Portal experience, especially those in the WebSphere Portal Server (WPS) space. Millions have been invested, yet the promise of personalized content with aggregation and integrated collaborative tools has never come to fruition. The move to WPS 7.x is a big rip and replace move, and clients are wondering if they should move somewhere else completely.    
 
 p  strong Portal Software: A horrible option that is better than all the alternatives /strong     
 
 p There are loads of Portal haters out there, and sometimes a portal solution is indeed overkill, but when you're talking about large, multi-national corporations, how would one recommend they architect a global solution without a portal server? Portals aren't always as fun to work with as Tomcat or JBoss AS, but when it comes to integrating multiple applications, managing content, updating individual applications that are deployed as individual war files, managing security down to the portlet level, proving a certain amount of personalization to users, and help with the overwhelming task of managing the thousands of pages large scale enterprises have as part of their internal and external websites, is there a better technology out there?     
 
 p  strong Garnering community insight and feedback /strong     
 
 p I've been trying to garner as much insight as possible. I wrote a little article on TSS about the issue:    
 
 p  a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=64293" rel="nofollow" Which other alternatives to portal exists on market? /a     
 
 p  a href="http://www.theserverside.com/tip/Every-enterprise-needs-an-employee-portal-Or-do-they" rel="nofollow" Every enterprise needs an employee portal. Or do they? /a     
 
 p I'm also resurrecting a thread at the CodeRanch to see if I can get any insight from that handsome crew.    
 
 p  a href="http://www.coderanch.com/t/578949 ortals-Portlets/java/alternative-Enterprise-Java-Portal-Any" rel="nofollow" Updated Thread Asking for an Alternative to a Portal Software Stragety. Circa 2012 /a

 p I'm also looking for some insight from the twitterati (@potemcam).    
 
 p It's not so much a cross-posting as much as it is an attempt to really gather some keen insight from the community. If I can get some solid responses and experiences, I'd like to aggregate them into an advice article over at TSS. So, any insight or experiences would be more than helpful.

<value columnNumber="1"> p My JMS client connects to WMQ through JNDI. The initial context factory used is  code com.ibm.mq.jms.context.WMQInitialContextFactory /code .    
 
 p Currently, at WMQ side, there's a queue manager called  code TestMgr /code . Under this queue manager I created two channels. One is  code PLAIN.CHL /code  which does not specify an SSL Cipher Spec, the other one is  code SSL.CHL /code  which configured SSL Cipher Spec with  code RC4_MD5_US /code  and SSL Authentication with  code Optional /code .     
 
 p I have created a key store for the queue manager using IBM Key Management tool. The path of key db is  code [wmq_home]\qmgrs\TestMgr\ssl\key /code .    
 
 p For channel  code PLAIN.CHL /code , I defined a queue connection factory like:    
 
 pre  code DEF QCF(PlainQCF) QMANAGER(TestMgr) CHANNEL(PLAIN.CHL) HOST(192.168.66.23) PORT(1414)   TRANSPORT(client) 
 /code   re  
 
 p And under the SSL channel  code SSL.CHL /code , I defined a queue connection factory like:    
 
 pre  code DEF QCF(SSLQCF) QMANAGER(TestMgr) CHANNEL(SSL.CHL) HOST(192.168.66.23) PORT(1414) TRANSPORT(client) SSLCIPHERSUITE(SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5) 
 /code   re  
 
 p Now I only can create connection using the  code PlainQCF /code . But failed to look up the SSL queue connection factory. My code looks like:    
 
 pre  code  Hashtable environment = new Hashtable(); 
    environment.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "com.ibm.mq.jms.context.WMQInitialContextFactory"); 
    environment.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, "192.168.66.23:1414/SSL.CHL"); 
    Context ctx = new InitialContext( environment ); 
    QueueConnectionFactory qcf = (QueueConnectionFactory) ctx.lookup("SSLQCF"); 
    qcf.createConnection(); 
    .... 
 /code   re  
 
 p Am I missing some context properties when looking up the SSL factory? connection And then I found the code is hanging on the line  code new InitialContext( environment ) /code  for a long time, almost 5 minutes, and I got  code CC=2;RC=2009;AMQ9208... /code  error.     
 
 p Any suggestion would be appreciated. Is it true that SSL channel can't be connected by JNDI?    
 
 hr  
 
 p @T.Rob, thanks for your reply very much. But we still want to use  code WMQInitialContextFactory /code , so I'm afraid I still need to find solution for this.

 p I also got some confusion with the error log. My app staged at at a machine which is different from my MQ. But the log says the  code Change the remote channel 'SSL.CHL' on host 'xxx_host of my app (192.168.66.25)' to 
specify a CipherSpec so that both ends of the channel have matching 
CipherSpecs. /code  How can I change the channel cipher spec on my app host?    
 
 hr  
 
 h3 updates on MQEnvironment... /h3  
 
 p reply the comments.    
 
 p The value of  code MQEnvironment.sslCipherSuite /code  is null, so it throws out NullPointerExcetpion when i put it the the env hashtable. But i tried another one  code environment.put(MQC.SSL_CIPHER_SUITE_PROPERTY, "SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5") /code  and it still failed with  code 2009 /code  error.     
 
 p For  code JMSAdmin /code  tool, i had changed the config to use  code WMQInitialContextFactory /code . The configuration like( code JMSAdmin.config /code ):    
 
 pre  code INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY=com.ibm.mq.jms.context.WMQInitialContextFactory 
PROVIDER_URL=192.168.66.23:1414/SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN 
 /code   re  
 
 p The rest configuration leaves as default.    
 
 p Kindly note, here i use the default channel  code SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN /code  so that i can logon to admin console. If I change the channel to the SSL one code SSL.CHL /code , I also can't logon to admin console. The error happened here is just like the one in my client app.     
 
 p Another clarification, in my client, i use follow code can connect to connect qmgr( code TestMgr /code ) successfully through channel  code SSL.CHL /code .    
 
 pre  code    MQConnectionFactory factory = new MQConnectionFactory(); 
    factory.setTransportType(JMSC.MQJMS_TP_CLIENT_MQ_TCPIP); 
    factory.setQueueManager("TestMgr"); 
    factory.setSSLCipherSuite("SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5"); 
    factory.setPort(1414); 
    factory.setHostName("192.168.66.23"); 
    factory.setChannel("SSL.CHL"); 
 
    MQConnection connection = (MQConnection) factory.createConnection(); 
 /code   re  
 
 p And now the problem is just like you said, that's the initial context failed connect to qmgr through SSL channel. The option( code use plain channel for initial context and ssl channel for connection factory /code ) you provided works too. But I still want to know how to get initial context with ssl channel work. Thanks for you patience very much. Your updates will be appreciated.    
 
 p thanks

 p Update    
 
 p I found this topic, and test the program on my AIX. 
When using hostname, it delayed for about 40s for DNS query. IP Address is normal.    
 
 p  a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/967717/java-cannot-resolve-dns-address-from-aix-unknownhostexception" Java cannot resolve DNS address from AIX: UnknownHostException /a     
 
 p By the way, the hostname shows server3, when I ping the name, it shows : 
PING server3.cf1.xx.xxxx.com ..... 
I run the program using server3.cf1.xx.xxxx.com, there is no delay.    
 
 p  strong Update2: /strong     
 
 p It is IPV6 problem. 
If I add -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true, the java application runs well. But java command still uses IPV6 to query DNS. So java command has 40s delay, and java application has no deley on DNS query.    
 
 p Can I set the default protocol to IPV4 in AIX, not java parameter?

The number of servers, the topology, what protocols/data formats to use etc. often needs to be decided for each situation and enterprise environment. An application environment built up of batch controlled legacy/main frame systems needs a very different integration setup then for instance an event driven Java EE or .NET stack of applications.

<value columnNumber="1"> p I see the point. This might be a bit tricky with "pure" JMS.     
 
 p What you essentially want to do is to let the portal publish messages to a topic, but not let the PAYROLLAPPs subscribe to that topic (since all of them would get a copy of the message). So what you would need is some logic in between that distributes the message from the topic subscription to one queue per application type. From that queue, normal load balanced (the competing consumer pattern) can be implemented with JMS.    
 
 p Different JMS providers have special implementations that can acomplish this task 
 a href="http://activemq.apache.org/virtual-destinations.html" rel="nofollow" ActiveMQ has its Virtual Destinations /a ,  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r0/topic/com.ibm.mq.amqnar.doc s10120_.htm" rel="nofollow" WebSphere MQ has its server side subscriptions that can subscribe from a topic to a queue /a . In the case your JMS provider does not have any way to handle this, you might want to look at adding some routing middleware to your topology. Apache Camel is a nice, lightweight one, but there are lots of others that can setup some routing in the middle without affecting the real applications.    
 
 blockquote

     p Update for detailed questions    
   /blockquote  
 /blockquote  
 
 ol  
 li  p The Queues below the line has to be there for sure (if your applications uses messaging). The "Some distrib. logic" box shouldn't be needed. The "Some routing logic" box could be an ESB or in this very case, be implemented in the messaging server, for instance ActiveMQ with virtual destinations (or WebSphere MQ or perhaps RabbitMQ among others).     /li  
 li  p There are a lot of buzwords in the domain of integration. Simplified (depending on who you ask - ESB can also be seen as an architectural pattern, but let's keep it simple), an ESB is a server application (or a topology of multiple servers in practice) that is a centerpiece of an integration landscape. The ESB server simply contain logic and small message flows that takes messages (files, or whatever) from one application and routes them to many applications, transform them to other formats, encrypts, converts from one transport protocol such as HTTP/SOAP to File etc.    /li  
 /ol  
 
 p JMS is a rather confusing and missused word. Java has to some extent dominated the enterprise messaging domain in the last years, so JMS is sometimes used pretty much as a synonym to Messaging. However, Messaging, (or message queueing, asynchronous messaging, MOM=message oriented middleware, etc.) is to be simply considered as a family of similar transport protocols that features a central relaying server. Is is not at all a Java only thing. Many successful ESBs setups I worked with actually leverage on a Messaging backbone    
 
 ol  
 li  p In your situation, I would not go too deep into the academical hilosophical differences between ESB and EAI software. They will most likely do pretty much the same things for you. Instead, look at the hard facts such as price, support, resource footprint, monitoring, tech. features, learning curve etc. Be it Camel/ServiceMix, Mule, JBoss ESB, Microsoft BizTalk, IBM Message Broker, Tibco etc.     /li  
 li  p Hah! Was it perhaps a salesman? An ESB will do just fine. A Messaging server will do in your case as well, such as ActiveMQ as has been pointed out already. BPM suits are fine for orchestrating semi-automatized business processes or if there is major business logic in the integration layer. Otherwise, avoid that added complexity.    /li

<value columnNumber="1"> p WebSphere MQ does not perform any authentication.  Local applications are authenticated by the operating system and so their ID can be trusted.  (By definition, if you cannot trust the local OS authentication then the entire server is compromised.)  Just as with local connections, WMQ trusts that the ID connecting remotely is genuine.  It is up to the WMQ administrator to determine what level of authentication to employ.  In WMQ v7 there are two choices - authenticate with SSL/TLS channels, or use a channel exit to authenticate.    
 
 p In either case, it is the channel's MCAUSER value that decides what ID is used for authorization.  If the MCAUSER is left blank then the channel will use the user ID that the client sends.  In your case you received a 2035 error because the client sent an ID that was not in the administrative (mqm) group.  Had your client sent the ID 'mqm' (or on Windows 'MUSR_MQADMIN'), the connection would have succeeded.  If your program is Java or JMS, the ability to select the ID presented is part of the API.  Just tell the QMgr who you want to be.    
 
 p If you are willing to allow remote connections to execute OS commands on the server, then just put the administrative ID in the channel's MCAUSER.  (For example, MCAUSER('mqm') on UNIX/Linux or typically MCAUSER('MUSR_MQADMIN') for Windows.)  However, be aware that remote users with admin rights can remotely execute arbitrary OS command-line code using the QMgr.  This is a feature of WMQ and not a bug, hence we NEVER recommend this in Production.  In fact, I personally recommend that development environments enable security.  Waiting until Production to figure out how to authenticate connections and what authorizations are needed often leads to unnecessary deployment delays.    
 
 p If you want to use IP filtering to mitigate that threat, you can either move to WMQ v7.1 which includes this feature natively, or use an exit such as  a href="http://mrmq.dk" rel="nofollow" BlockIP2 /a .  Either of these solutions will allow you to create rules that filter incoming connection requests by IP address, user ID, etc.    
 
 p Note that on a v7.0 QMgr all the channels are unprotected by default.  So even if you filter incoming requests on one channel, if the others are left in their default state, anyone can still connect and execute commands as the administrator.  For a comprehensive review of all this, please take a look at the Hardening WebSphere MQ presentation at  a href="http://t-rob.net/links" rel="nofollow" t-rob.net /a .  Scroll down to the v7.0 presentations.

<value columnNumber="1"> p The default operation of MQ is that when a message is sent (MQPUT or in JMS terms producer.send), the application does not get a response back on the MQPUT call until the message has reached a queue on a queue manager.  i.e. MQPUT is a synchronous call, and if you get a completion code of OK, that means that the queue manager to which the client application is connected has received the message successfully.  It may not yet have reached its ultimate destination, but it has reached the protection of an MQ Server, and therefore you can rely on MQ to look after the message and forward it on to where it needs to get to.    
 
 p Whether client connected, or locally bound to the queue manager, applications sending messages are responsible for their data until an MQPUT call returns successfully.  Similarly, receiving applications are responsible for their data once they get it from a successful MQGET (or JMS consumer.receive) call.    
 
 p There are multiple levels of message protection are available. 
If you are using non-persistent messages and asynchronous PUTs, then you are effectively saying it doesn't matter too much whether the messages reach their destination (although they generally will). 
If you want MQ to really look after your messages, use synchronous PUTs as described above, persistent messages, and perform your PUTs and GETs within transactions (aka syncpoint) so you have full application control over the commit points.    
 
 p If you have very unreliable networks such that you expect to regularly fail to get the messages to a server, and expect to need regular retries such that you need client-side message protection, one option you could investigate is MQ Telemetry (e.g. in WebSphere MQ V7.1) which is designed for low bandwidth and/or unreliable network communications, as a route into the wider MQ.

<value columnNumber="1"> p First of all, if it is unspecified, this means that it is left as a container's implementation detail. br  
So you should look into  code WebSphere /code  specifically. br  
I think the same would happen in  code Tomcat /code  as well, since the security constraints (if I recall correctly) are implemented via  code Valves /code  and so would precede the application code in the request chain. br  
From my point of view it makes sense, since if you assign the protection to your container, then if the request reaches your filter then it should have already passed your container's authentication mechanism (my point of view is that the filter is part of your resources). br  
In Tomcat you would solve your problem by replacing the  code Filter /code  with a  code Valve /code

<value columnNumber="1"> p Middleware messaging was born of the need to persist data locally to mitigate the effects of failures of the remote node or of the network.  The idea at the time was that the queue manager was installed locally on the box where the application lives and was treated as part of the transport stack.  For instance you might install TCP and WMQ as a transport and some apps would use TCP while others used WMQ.    
 
 p In the intervening 20 years, the original problems that led to the creation of MQSeries (Now WebSphere MQ) have largely been solved.  The networks have improved by several nines of availability and high availability hardware and software clustering have provided options to keep the different components available 24x7.    
 
 p So the practices in widespread use today to address your question follow two basic approaches.  Either make the components highly available so that the client can always find a messaging server, or put a QMgr where the application lives in order to provide local queueing.

<value columnNumber="1"> p  a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoiceXML" rel="nofollow" VoiceXML (VXML) /a  is the W3C's standard XML format for specifying interactive voice dialogues between a human and a computer. It allows voice applications to be developed and deployed in an analogous way to HTML for visual applications. Just as HTML documents are interpreted by a visual web browser, VoiceXML documents are interpreted by a voice browser.    
 
 p Typically, HTTP is used as the transport protocol for fetching VoiceXML pages. Some applications may use static VoiceXML pages, while others rely on dynamic VoiceXML page generation using an application server like Tomcat, Weblogic, IIS, or WebSphere. br  
Historically, VoiceXML platform vendors have implemented the standard in different ways, and added proprietary features. But the VoiceXML 2.0 standard, adopted as a W3C Recommendation on 16 March 2004, clarified most areas of difference. The VoiceXML Forum, an industry group promoting the use of the standard, provides a conformance testing process that certifies vendors' implementations as conformant.

 p I have a web application was previously running on WAS 6.1 but we wanted to move to WASCE.  The implementation was such that we had a symlinked directory "symdir" inside the Web Content folder that pointed to another folder on the same filesystem but outside the web application and WASCE for that matter.  Under the covers we would dynamically build content in the symlinked directory and then create links to it.  For example in symdir -  /tagHome we would create /tagFile/some.tag so the web app would know it as symdir/tagFile/some.tag and the f/s would know it was /tagHome/tagFile/some.tag. Then we would create a link to it at  a href="http://hostname:port/context/symdir/tagFile/some.tag" rel="nofollow" http://hostname:port/context/symdir/tagFile/some.tag /a  and render the file--it was simple xml. This all worked before on WAS 6.1.     
 
 p However, now when I move the application to WASCE on this type of configuration no longer works.  Specifically I am not able to traverse any symlinked directories and get any content back.

Correct, by default JRules comes with Studio and RES. br     
 
 p RES is a WAR file you need to deploy on a WAS. I think that by default it is only provided with the messy WebSphere but you can download some "bundles" for JBoss, WebLogic, ... and more. br  
Program / Ilog Jrules / documentation / How to install RES - RTFM br  
 br  
One could use WebSphereCE but this is just crappy. br  
It is provided by default and you can use that straight away but you don't want to use it in live or even for POCs. br We call this pseudo WAS "Bernardo" like in Zorro because it is silent :)    
 
 p BTW: you don't need RES to execute a rule. Specially with JUnit, you can export the ruleapp or ruleset (I don't remember) and use POJO straight away. br  
Create a new project in Studio called: "new java project for rules" ish and the wizard will create all you need to execute your rules locally. br  
You will just need to code the InputParameters and retrieve the OutputParameters in order to assert. br  
EZ PZ lemon squizzy :)    
 
 p From there you can load the ruleapp in your "before" JUnit method, makes sense? br  
Rather that connect the RES itself. 
 br  br  
To sum up, if I were you: br  
1/ I would create the example project I mentioned. So I have the code example. br  
2/ I create my own ruleapp (right click on the rule project / export / ruleapp) and store it somewhere. br  
3/ prepare my JUnit classes - Assertion + "Before" methods br  
4/ run it locally without RES br  
5/ I'm happy as Larry br  
6/ Now I deal with RES and configure it br  br

 p These devices connect to an organizations back-end network via MQTT protocol for sending and receiving messages. For example a temperature sensor in an oil pipeline would collect temperature of the oil flowing through the pipe and send it to the control center. In response a command message could be sent over MQTT to another device to reduce/stop the flow of oil through that pipe.

 p the script is working fine for a fresh installation. ie if the mentioned software was not installed on the system already.    
 
 p However, I need to enhance this script such that, it should check the system for existing installations of Websphere MQ and its version. 
--if the version is not the one which we require(which of course , i will provide from command line) , it should initiate a uninstallation.    
 
 p The problem is I don't want to use the approach of searching the file system. 
So how do I accomplish this task using WMI classes.?? I looked up Win32_Product class, but it only returned me one installed program(Although, I have arnd 40 applications installed on my system).So I want to know: 
1)what is the concrete method of searching for a particular program on a system.(I am open to VbScripting or batch programming) 
2)Does the value of registry key for a installed software remains same across all systems and does it differ with different virsions??

You can also tell this from the class names, which probably have funny prefixes and suffixes attached original bean name and reside in the same package. So, developer did not write these classes himself, they are generated for WebSphere, and they shall be omitted (cleaned up from project) before migrating to an application server from another vendor. On how to get rid of these classes you may find instructions at tech note below.

 p I would say that you have a pair of problems here, because most probably Enterprise Java spec that was used is not currently supported by new servers (it is probably 1.2 as it is very old). So you must first perform a specification level migration, then application server migration.     
 
 p For specification level migration (i.e. Java EE 1.2 to 1.4 at least) I would say your best bet would be to use RAD (Rational Application Developer), which can perform specification migration by using simple wizards. You may find information about how to perform this migration at article below.

 p Once you upgrade spec level it will be easier to migrate your project to another server because as the spec level increases, effort for server to server migration decreases. At this point what you shall do basically is prepare application server specific deployment descriptors for your target server (Glassfish), for which you shall check glassfish website. A good entry point would be Glassfish migration wiki, and Glassfish verification tool (I can't put links to these because I don't enough reputation to post more than two link at the moment :)

 p But the methods it's complaining about are really in the classes and I've redeployed it and restarted the server. So it seems that some changes are not updated. What is the correct way to handle this? I can compile and clean the project but there's this runtime exception when I try access the JSP page. I use RAD 8 and WAS 8 and that's where the stacktrace appears.     
 
 h2 Update /h2  
 
 p I did not solve this yet. The environment is IBM RAD 8 (=Eclipse) and WAS (websphere) 8 and my JSP doesn't recognize the newly added method to my Java class. I suspect there is some kind of caching going on that won't enable me to reload my classes. I've tried deleting the temporary files from the JSP and restarting the server and also I've cleaned the project but the error still appears. What should I do?    
 
 h2 Update 2 /h2  
 
 p I could remove one of the offending classes and instead get a noclassfounderror but that is not much better. The IBM RAD is not working for me, it would've been better to develop from the command prompt than an IDE that makes it impossible for you to do development.

<value columnNumber="1"> p We have a large web application, some of which uses  a href="http://tiles.apache.org/" rel="nofollow" Apache Tiles /a  which, in places, are heavily nested. On all web application containers tested (Tomcat, JBoss, JonAs and I think WebSphere) there have been no issues, however on  a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/weblogic/overview/index.html" rel="nofollow" WebLogic /a  we have problems.

 p The issue may be caused by improper use of Tiles and how they should be nested, if so please let me know, but ideally, due to the extent of this, possibly improper use, we'd like to find a workaround.    
 
 p We did try changing the character encoding to avoid use of WebLogic's JSPWriter (from a quick inspection of source code, the choice of  a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/1.4/api/javax/servlet/jsp/JspWriter.html" rel="nofollow" JSPWriter /a  depends on character encoding settings). Changing encoding to a combination of UTF-8 and UTF-16 (which was wrong and broke things in other containers) fixed the WebLogic issue because it no longer used WebLogic's JSPWriter (and all that came with it).

 p i just came from classpath hell with WebSphere (damn, what a fu**ed up product) and now i'm here. hope somebody can help me with this.    
 
 p A basic explanation of what exacly goes wrong and maybe providing a better understanding of springs autowired injection feature would be great. I've read the spring documentation, but to say the truth: there are so many ways to configure something and it's not quite visible to me WHAT is really needed when choosing one of the config styles.    
 
 p  strong EDIT /strong     
 
 p After trying to update the project i'm still getting the error. as requested here a little more details (trace):

 p I was looking through icefaces.jar and noticed that there is a BridgeFacesContext.class in icefaces.jar\com\icesoft\faces\context.  Not sure if this is the same class that it can't find.    
 
 p I have tried different versions of WebSphere's built-in JSF jars (after seeing  a href="http://jforum.icesoft.org/JForum osts/list/20359.page" rel="nofollow" this /a ), but no luck.  Does anyone know how to configure ICEFaces 1.8.2 to work with WAS 8?    
 
 p Do I need to upgrade to ICEFaces 3?  If so, is the open-source version compatible with WAS 8?  (WAS 8 seems to be only listed under the EE version  a href="http://www.icesoft.org rojects/ICEfaces/supported-platforms.jsf" rel="nofollow" here /a )

Each queue connection factory you create also has a max connections property that is set to 50.  Our application has MDBs using activation specifications (there are actually 12 different MDBs).  It will also need to use a queue connection to send a reply for each request.    
 
 p Now - the application seems to come up fine even with 12 activation specs used (i.e. the app works ok) even though there are only 10 max connections configured for the resource adapter.  Therefore, I have the following questions on the relationship (or lack thereof) of these two settings:    
 
 ol  
 li Are the settings on the MQ resource adapter actually used?  Or do I just think that 12 requests could be processed in parallel when really only 10 would be? /li  
 li Are the settings on the queue connection factory used for everything, or partially (ex: the response needs to be sent so if a new connection is opened then it will use the queue connection factory's settings [and the resource adapter only applies to the activation specs])? /li  
 li Can I expect a single queue connection to be re-used for the listener and sending of the response (the response goes back to the same MQ queue manager)? /li

Let me clarify what is RES because it seems there is a misunderstanding here, it may be me. br  
RES is used in Ilog terminology to describe multiple things: br  
- The web interface that allows you to manage your ruleapp. br  
- The actual application that you deploy on your WebSphere CE (or else) in order to execute the rules. br  
- The .jar files that allows you to execute the ruleapp locally. br  br  
You, AFAIK, cannot connect RES using a local JAVA application. br  
What you have coded is calling the rule engine contained in the RES*.jar files in order to execute your ruleapp locally. br  
There is no way you can use your JAVA application like you are using your EJB application. br  
You have to use a webservice or else which is feasible if you put the ruleapp name as a parameter of the web service for instance. br  
You are using miniloan so you probably know the example using the web interface where you can tell which version of the ruleset to use. br  
It will be the same if you want to programmatically manage your ruleapp deployed on RES (real application on your application server) you will need to use MDB. Nothing else. br  
 br  
It is disapointing, I know because I went through that, but there is no way I know (at least) to do that. This is not the behaviour you have to follow. br  
 br  
To make it work then put your ruleapp in the classpath (or root of your JAVA application in eclipse) and run it... Then you will execute your rules. br  br  
RES doesn't provide the same tools than RTS where you can access RTS from any JAVA application in order to manipulate your rule project. br  
 br  
You are 100% correct there is no way to tell the J2SE connection what is the server URL and hence no way to run your rules from the server. br  
Hope it helps.

<value columnNumber="1"> p Spring Security offers a comprehensive, container-neutral approach that I have successfully used on both WebSphere and Tomcat (particularly building / testing on Tomcat and deploying on WebSphere).    
 
 p What I really like about the framework is that it gives you an application-centric, source-neutral view of the current user and their authorities in the application. So that means that you can load the user and the authorities from anywhere, and only the configuration need be concerned with where it comes from (LDAP, database, property file, in-memory testing object, SAML assertion, etc.)    
 
 p It also gives you a lot of fine-grained authorization control (URL-based and method based) that you simply don't have defined in Java EE Security. You can use regular expressions and Ant-style expressions for pattern matching that you wouldn't otherwise have. The expression syntax is also quite rich. If you need to do data-specific access control, DDL is provided for you to add to your database and integrate directly into your security.    
 
 p Spring Security runs as a filter to all of your requests to the web container using the "/*" URL mapping (or whichever mapping you choose to secure).

   p Spring applications will quite often be deployed to run within a JEE application server such as WebSphere, JBoss, or even a web container like Tomcat. These servers allow you to configure data sources to be retrieved via JNDI. The benefit of configuring data sources in this way is that they can be managed completely external 
  to the application, leaving the application to simply ask for a data source when itâ€™s ready to access the database. Moreover, data sources managed in an application server are often pooled for greater performance and can be hot-swapped by system administrators.

 p It is somewhat annoying that we can't use JSF 2.0. In particular, view scope would be ideal for our app. It will be a high usage site and keeping all the page beans in session scope is wasteful and I'm sure will cause raised eyebrows from our non-functional testing team later on.    
 
 p It occurred to me that I could emulate View Scope by using Spring's custom scope and a custom JSF component that simply maintains a map of active beans set by the Spring scope and attaching this component on our pages. Together with a custom variable resolver that can find beans in this map, we should be able to emulate view scope    
 
 p (Our journey is only four pages, but each page has a few postbacks to the same page)

      ((BindingProvider)port).getRequestContext().put(BindingProviderProperties.REQUEST_TIMEOUT, 180000); 
((BindingProvider)port).getRequestContext().put(BindingProviderProperties.CONNECT_TIMEOUT, 120000);    
 
 p Is there a timeout property in JAXWS for the responseContext?  Something like:RESPONSE_TIMEOUT?    
 
 p Websphere has these 
 1. CONNECTION_TIMEOUT: The amount of time WebSphere JAX-WS client would wait to establish a http/https connection (default is 180 seconds) 
2. WRITE_TIMEOUT: The amount of time the client would wait to finish sending the request (default is 300 seconds)

<value columnNumber="1"> p EL 2.2 is not part of JSF 2.0. It's part of Servlet 3.0 which in turn is part of Java EE 6. But WebSphere 7 is a Java EE 5 container, not a Java EE 6 one. JSF 2.0 is part of Java EE 6 but backwards compatible with Servlet 2.5 / Java EE 5, that's probably where your confusion is coming from.    
 
 p As said, WebSphere 7 is a Servlet 2.5 container and thus doesn't ship with EL 2.2, but with EL 2.1. Your best bet is to install an EL 2.1 implementation which supports the same enhancements (invoking methods with arguments) as in EL 2.2. There's only one:  a href="http://docs.jboss.org/seam/latest-2/reference/en-US/html/elenhancements.html" rel="nofollow" JBoss EL /a . To install it, just drop  a href="https://maven.atlassian.com/content/repositories/jboss-releases/org/jboss/seam/jboss-el/2.0.0.GA/jboss-el-2.0.0.GA.jar" rel="nofollow" jboss-el.jar /a  in webapp's  code /WEB-INF/lib /code  and add the following context parameter to  code web.xml /code  to tell MyFaces to use it instead.

In the table with users I see  "Ã¦â€”Â¥Ã¦Å“Â¬Ã¨ÂªÅ¾" instead of "æ—¥æœ¬èªž", which are characters from ASCII table and they are nine because Japanese characters are encoded with 3 bytes.

 p I need to measure HTTP request took over the network in a JavaScript web application connected to a Java backend (Servlet). The "total network duration" is computed as the total request duration from the client side (includes client- server communication, server processing, server- client communication), minus the server processing duration. Thus, the "total network duration" includes the following parts:    
 
 ul  
 li HTTP request sending by the browser (may include request queuing) /li  
 li Protocol stack for sending on the client (HTTP, TCP/IP, ...) /li  
 li  strong Wire communication client- server /strong  (e.g. Ethernet network) /li  
 li Protocol stack for receiving on the server (HTTP, TCP/IP, ...) /li  
 li HTTP request reception by the application server (may include request queuing) /li  
 li Protocol stack for sending on the server (HTTP, TCP/IP, ...) /li  
 li  strong Wire communication server- client /strong  (e.g. Ethernet network) /li  
 li Protocol stack for receiving on the client (HTTP, TCP/IP, ...) /li  
 li HTTP request reception by the browser /li  
 /ul  
 
 p In the general case, most of total duration in the wire duration. But in some cases, the "total network duration" for a given query is high and your network administrator shows you some stats where the wire communication is very low. In that case, the "total network duration" is consumed in the other elements above. In my specific case, I suspect the application server (WebSphere 7) to put the HTTP request in a waiting queue because the HTTP connection pool is full.    
 
 h1 Question /h1  
 
 p When the application server's HTTP connection pool is full, each incoming HTTP request is put in a waiting state into an "incoming HTTP request queue". The application server has configuration parameters used to tune this behavior (HTTP connection pool size, incoming HTTP request wait timeout, ...), but this is not the point here.    
 
 p  strong How to get the HTTP request waiting time, i.e. when the HTTP request is processed by a Java Servlet or Filter or RequestListener, how to determine how much time the application server delayed the HTTP request when waiting for a free thread in the HTTP connection pool ? /strong     
 
 p The ideal solution would be to use an hypothetical application server API (in this case: which one, and ideally for WebSphere 7?). 
Alternatively, I thought about a HTTP proxy between the network and the application server. This proxy will add a timestamp header on the incoming HTTP request (e.g. "X-Request-Reception-Time =   time in milliseconds "), so that I can determine time taken by the application server by doing "HTTP request Servlet start processing timestamp" - "X-Request-Reception-Time".

<value columnNumber="1"> p Hibernate does not use Log4J directly. This is why your messages are falling into WebSphere SystemOut.log file.    
 
 p Up to version 3.2, hibernate used Jakarta Commons Logging as a logging facade. From version 3.3 and above, it switched to SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java). As jakarta commons logging (JCL), SLF4J is just a facade, often binding to other Logging Frameworks, like Java Logging or, in this case, Log4J itself.    
 
 p I understand your application already uses Log4J. I'm also assuming you're using Hibernate 3.3 or a newer version.    
 
 p The first thing is to add SLF4J support to your project. You do that by adding these dependencies (with Ivy, Maven or however you want):    
 
 p  strong slf4j-api.jar /strong  (Core SLF4J packages)    
 
 p  strong slf4j-log4j12.jar /strong  (Binds SLF4J to Log4J)    
 
 p This way, when Hibernate logs some message, SLF4J will capture it and route it to Log4J.    
 
 p Now, when it comes up to your own app code, you have two approaches.    
 
 p 1: Keep your classes directly interacting to Log4J classes (namely Logger and LoggerFactory)    
 
 p This way, you keep your classes directly referencing Log4J Logger, like this:    
 
 pre  code Logger  logger = Logger.getLogger("com.foo"); // from package org.apache.log4j 
 /code   re  
 
 p So, in short, Hibernate will use SLF4J -  Log4J and you will use directly Log4J    
 
 p 2: The second approach is to have your code use SLF4J as well. This isn't so big a change, as you'll probably have to change just one line of code in each of your classes that produces log messages:    
 
 pre  code Logger  logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger("com.foo"); // from package org.slf4j 
 /code   re  
 
 p If you are using an older version of Hibernate (3.2 or older), you'll have to trick It not to use Jakarta Commons Logging. First, you'll have to purge commons-logging JAR files from your dependencies (either manually or with an exclusion, if you use any dependency manager). Then you'll have to add an SLF4J port of commons-logging to your classpath:    
 
 p add  strong jcl-over-slf4j-x.y.z.jar /strong  (x.y.z being its version. I use  strong jcl-over-slf4j-1.6.1.jar /strong , for example).    
 
 p This jar has the exact classes and packages of old commons-logging.jar, thus effectively tricking all commons-logging dependent applications to log to SLF4J in fact.

And a lot others need a lot of customization which my admin will never allow. Also the interface language is Arabic which makes another set of these frameworks useless to me. 
One other reason is that you may need it for one specific task which doesn't need you to overload your application with one of these frameworks since they add hooks and stuff into the lifecycle which may affect the scalability of your pages. 
But you have to note that working with these frameworks makes life a lot easier than working jsf with jquery to do the same task. br

<value columnNumber="1"> p WebSphere 7 runs Java EE 5 (I think), so your choices are little bit limited in that regard.    
 
 p You can use a library like  a href="http://quartz-scheduler.org/" rel="nofollow" Quartz Scheduler /a , but you have to be careful to hook it up to a thread pool which is managed by the container. I believe by default it just creates threads on its own which is outright prohibited in EJBs (and strongly discouraged in the web container).    
 
 p I found a nice blog post that walks you through the configuration of setting up a work manager pool on WebSphere:  a href="http://sanjsuya.wordpress.com/2012/01/19/asynchronousbean-was-spring-integration/" rel="nofollow" http://sanjsuya.wordpress.com/2012/01/19/asynchronousbean-was-spring-integration/ /a     
 
 p If you're using Spring, you can then hook up the Quartz scheduler to this thread pool fairly easily using a WorkManagerTaskExecutor. Here's some Spring documentation on that (note, it's from Spring 2, but I'm sure you more-or-less do something like this for Spring 3 as well):  a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/reference/scheduling.html" rel="nofollow" http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/reference/scheduling.html /a     
 
 p EDIT: the architect in me is cringing slightly (though maybe you have a good reason for doing it the way you're doing it). Why are you writing e-mails to a DB and not to a queue? That way, they could be processed at the leisure of a receiving system, and you're not overloading a whole lot of background work onto WebSphere.

 p This way, the deployment.xml is being packaged when I export the EAR. My deployment.xml is the same as shown in the tutorial.

So XMS.Net seems to crash on empty bodies for CoA's and CoD's. I need to confirm some things to ensure it's not caused by other stuff in my project interfering but I'm quite sure this is the cause.

 p  strong Update: /strong       
 
 p Here's the normal diagnostic process.    
 
 ol  
 li If the WMQ components were installed by relocating libraries or classes from somewhere else, perform an install using the full vendor-supplied client media.  This includes troubleshooting utilities such as trace, dspmqver, etc.  It also resolves any library or class mismatch issues. /li  
 li Use the pre-compiled client programs to test the connection.  The  code amqsputc /code ,  code amqsgetc /code  and  code amqsbcgc /code  programs require the  code MQSERVER /code  environment variable  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.mq.doc/cs12280_.htm" rel="nofollow" as described here /a .  The Q program from  a href="http://ibm.co/SupptPacMA01" rel="nofollow" SupportPac MA01 /a  is a separate download but has the advantage of NOT requiring any environment variables, CCDT files or other dependencies. /li  
 li If the sample programs fail, check the QMgr's error logs at  code [WMQ install]/qmgrs/[QMgr name]/errors/AMQERR01.LOG /code  for messages.  Also check for FDC files and errors in  code [WMQ install]/errors /code . /li  
 li If no errors on the QMgr side, attempt the connection again while using a client-side trace as described  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.mq.msc.doc/xms_ctrouble_trace_net.html" rel="nofollow" here /a  and  a href="http:/ ublib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmqv7/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.mq.doc/cs12880_.htm" rel="nofollow" here /a . /li  
 /ol  
 
 p Most client problems are resolved through installation of the full WMQ client as supplied by IBM. (Conversely that implies most people are installing by grabbing DLL or JAR files.)  If the problem persists, error log inspection on the QMgr and client side usually reveals the underlying cause.  If these do not work then tracing usually diagnoses the remaining issues.    
 
 p  strong UPDATE 2: /strong  br  
Per the error messages  a href="http://www.mqseries.net hpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=332547#332547" rel="nofollow" posted at MQSeries.net /a , the channel has a security exit set.  A security exit is external code that the channel calls out to when starting a channel.  There is no way to know what the exit expects or does without having access to the code or docs of the exit.  If the exit is written in-house, you'll need to talk to the programmer to figure out what it requires. If the exit is a commercial product then you will need to get the documentation for it.      
 
 p Alternatively, alter the channel so that  code SCYEXIT /code  is blank to disable the exit.    
 
 p The data posted at MQSeries.net was as follows:    
 
 pre  code MQ9575: DCE Security: failed to get the user's login name. 
 
EXPLANATION: 
 
System call 192.168.50.55 to get the login name of the user running WebSphere 
MQ client application process 5 failed with error value -1. This occurred in 
security exit function create_cred. The exit will now attempt to open channel 
using the DCE default login context. 
ACTION: 
If you wish to run using the DCE default login context take no action. If you 
wish to run using the user's login name as the DCE security exit principal 
examine the documentation for the operating system on which you are running MQ 
clients and reconfigure the operating system as necessary to allow the 
192.168.50.55 call to succeed.  
 /code   re  
 
 p Note that it states the call is failing in the security exit.

 p When I try to access the request via a TagLib or a Filter it appears that the Web Container (WebSphere) is performing a redirect my login.jsp.  The ${param.resource} does not work either due to the redirect.    
 
 p The easiest solution would be to have the browser perform a forward instead of a redirect, but so far I cannot find a way to enforce a forward in the security constraints (or anywhere else).  I have thought of a few other convoluted session flows, but I like none of them.     
 
 p The only solution that is somewhat acceptable is to include some JavaScript that updates the action to include the URL params, but that does not work all the time because some browsers leave the original URL and some are updated to the redirect URL (wwwtest.mycompany.com/mwa/login.jsp).     
 
 p How can I either enforce request to be forwarded instead of redirected for security, or get around this problem in a different manner altogether?

They added some WebSphere specific patches.    
 
 p I'm not sure if they update the JSF implementation with their fix packs. If you need a specific patch you could go for the original implementation, however I would usually stay with the default implementation.
