<p>It seems people are assuming I am talking about private or protected variables/properties only. When I learned OO I was taught to use getters/setters for every single property even if it was public (and actually I was told never to make any variable/property public). So, I may be starting off from a false assumption from the get go. It appears that people answering this question are maybe saying that you should have public properties and that those don't need getters and setters, which goes against what I was taught, and what I was talking about, although maybe that needs to be discussed as well. That's probably a good topic for a different question though...</p>

<p>My specific case is that I have a mock class for a test.  There is no default constructor, but I want one to make the tests simpler to read.  I also want to wrap the exceptions thrown from the constructor into a RuntimeException.</p>

<p>So, what I want to do is effectively this:</p>

Actually, I just exported the change into the variables rather than use the new /etc/profile (a reboot later will pick up the changes and I will be golden).</p>

<p>I am using 1.5, and it is most definitely a DST problem.  As you can see, the time zone is set to not use daylight savings.

Since the generic -8 offset has no daylight savings info, it's of course not using it, but the question is, where do I tell Java to use Pacific time zone when it starts up?

What we now need is to create some way to separate the shared context (shared across all applets currently showing) and non-shared context (specific to each applet currently showing). However, we don't have an ID at each of the locations that call to the singleton, nor do we want to propagate the ID to all locations.

<p>I'm writing a small display to show customers what days they can water their lawns based on their watering group (ABCDE) and what time of year it is.  Our seasons look like this:
Summer (5-1 to 8-31) 
Spring  (3-1 to 4-30) 
Fall (9-1 to 10-31)
Winter (11-1 to 2-28) </p>

<p>An example might be:</p>

<p>If I'm in group A, here would be my allowed times:
Winter: Mondays only
Spring: Tues, Thurs, Sat
Summer: Any Day
Fall: Tues, Thurs, Sat</p>

<p>If I was writing this in PHP I would use arrays like this:</p>

<pre><code>//M=Monday,t=Tuesday,T=Thursday.... etc
$schedule[""A""][""Winter""]='M';
$schedule[""A""][""Spring""]='tTS';
$schedule[""A""][""Summer""]='Any';
$schedule[""A""][""Fall""]='tTS';
$schedule[""B""][""Winter""]='t';
</code></pre>

<p>I COULD make the days arrays (array(""Tuesday"",""Thursday"",""Saturday"")) etc, but it is not necessary for what I'm really trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>I will also need to setup arrays to determine what season I'm in:</p>

<pre><code>$seasons[""Summer""][""start""]=0501;
$seasons[""Summer""][""end""]=0801;
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone suggest a really cool way to do this? I will have today's date and the group letter.  I will need to get out of my function a day (M) or a series of days (tTS), (Any).</p>

The same app on other servers does not exhibit this behavior. This happens on WebSphere and Tomcat.  The environment is tricky to set up so it is difficult to try to do something like profiling within Eclipse.</p>

<p>Is there a way to profile (or some other method of inspecting) an existing Java app running in Tomcat to find out what methods are being executed while it's in this spinwait kind of state?  The app is only executing one method when it gets in this state (vendor's method). Vendor can't replicate the behavior (of course).</p>

<p>Update:  </p>

<p>Using JConsole I was able to determine who was running and what they were doing.  It took me a few hours to then figure out why it was doing it.  The problem ended up being that the vendor's API jar that was being used did not match exactly to the the database configuration that it was using.  It was defaulting to having tracing and performance monitoring enabled on the servers that had the slight mis-match in configuration.  I used a different jar and all is well.</p>

<p>So thanks, Joshua, for your answer. JConsole was extremely easy to setup and use to monitor an existing application. </p>

<p>@Cringe - I did some experimenting with some of the options you suggested.  I had some problems with getting JProfiler set up, it looks good (but pricey).  Going forward I went ahead and added the Eclipse Profiler plugin and I'll be looking over the different open source profilers to compare functionality.</p>

<p>I would like to import the application to Maven and Subversion. After some research I found that two practical approaches exists for this.</p>

<p>One is using a tree structure just as the previous one. The drawback of this structure is that you need a ton of tweaking/hacks to get the multi-module reporting work well with Maven. Another downside is that in Subversion the standard trunk/tags/branches approach add even more complexity to the repository.</p>

<p>The other approach uses a flat structure, where there are only one parent project and all the modules, submodules and parts-of-the-submodules are a direct child of the parent project. This approach works well for reporting and is easier in Subversion, however I feel I lose a bit of the structure this way.</p>

<p>Which way would you choose in the long term and why?</p>

For those that don't know (probably everyone), Project Darkstar is a framework for massively multiplayer online games that attempts to take care of all of the ""hard stuff.""  The basic idea is that you write your game server logic in such a way that all operations are broken up into tiny tasks.  You pass these tasks to the Project Darkstar framework which handles distributing them to a specific node in the cluster, any concurrency issues, and finally persisting the data.</p>

<p>Apparently doing this kind of thing is a much different problem for video games than it is for enterprise applications.  Jim Waldo, who gave the lecture, claims that MMO games have a DB read/write ratio of 50/50, whereas enterprise apps are more like 90% read, 10% write.  He also claims that most existing MMOs keep everything in memory exlcusively, and only dump to a DB every 6 hours of so.  This means if a server goes down, you would lose all of the work since the last DB dump.</p>

<p>Now, the project itself sounds really cool, but I don't think the industry will accept it.  First, you have to write your server code in Java.  The client code can be written in anything (Jim claims ActionScript 3 is the most popular, follow by C++), but the server stuff has to be Java.  Sounds good to me, but I really get the impression that everyone in the games industry hates Java.</p>

<p>Second, unlike other industries where developers prefer to use existing frameworks and libraries, the guys in the games industry seem to like to write everything themselves.  Not only that, they like to rewrite everything for every new game they produce.  Things are starting to change where developers are using Havok for physics, Unreal Engine 3 as their platform, etc., but for the most part it looks like everything is still proprietary.</p>

<p>So, are the guys at Project Darkstar just wasting their time?  Can a general framework like this really work for complex games with the performance that is required?  Even if it does work, are game companies willing to use it?</p>

<p>(*) ""in"" means the unique identifier matches, not necessarily the content.</p>

<p>The current (legacy) code does many comparisons to figure out <code>removeSet</code>, <code>addSet</code>, <code>updateSet</code>, <code>startSet</code> and <code>endSet</code>, and then loop to act on each item.</p>

<p>The code is quite messy (partly because I have left out some spaghetti logic already) and I am trying to refactor it.  Some more background info:</p>

<ul>
<li>As far as I know, the <code>oldSet</code> and <code>newSet</code> are actually backed by <code>ArrayList</code></li>
<li>Each set contains less than 100 items, most likely max out at 20</li>
<li>This code is called frequently (measured in millions/day), although the sets seldom differ</li>
</ul>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I convert <code>oldSet</code> and <code>newSet</code> into <code>HashMap&lt;Foo&gt;</code> (order is not of concern here), with the IDs as keys, would it made the code easier to read and easier to compare?  How much of time &amp; memory performance is loss on the conversion?</li>
<li>Would iterating the two sets and perform the appropriate operation be more efficient and concise?</li>

<p>I've decided to explore the option having the same program, that currently recieves a single format XML document, receive two additional XML document formats, with various XML element changes.  I was hoping to just swap out the ContentHandler with an appropriate one based on the first ""startElement"" in the document... but, uh-duh, the ContentHandler is set and <strong>then</strong> the document is parsed!</p>

<pre><code>... constructor ...
{
SAXParserFactory spf = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();

try {
SAXParser sp = spf.newSAXParser();
parser = sp.getXMLReader();
parser.setErrorHandler(new MyErrorHandler());
} catch (Exception e) {}

parser.setContentHandler(pP);
parser.parse(new InputSource(new StringReader(xml.toString())));

For speed and efficiency purposes I never really looked at DOM because these XML documents are fairly large and the system receives about 1200 every few minutes.  It's just a one way send of information</p>

<p>To make this question too long and add to my confusion; following is a mockup of some various XML documents that I would like to have a single SAX, StAX, or ?? parser cleanly deal with. </p>

<p>But I want to recover from specific problems, and I'm not sure the best way to approach it with unchecked exceptions. Here is a concrete example.</p>

<p>Suppose I have a web application, built using Struts2 and Hibernate. If an exception bubbles up to my ""action"", I log it, and display a pretty apology to the user. But one of the functions of my web application is creating new user accounts, that require a unique user name. If a user picks a name that already exists, Hibernate throws an <code>org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException</code> (an unchecked exception) down in the guts of my system. I'd really like to recover from this particular problem by asking the user to choose another user name, rather than giving them the same ""we logged your problem but for now you're hosed"" message.</p>

<p>Here are a few points to consider:</p>

<ol>
<li>There a lot of people creating accounts simultaneously. I don't want to lock the whole user table between a ""SELECT"" to see if the name exists and an ""INSERT"" if it doesn't. In the case of relational databases, there might be some tricks to work around this, but what I'm really interested in is the general case where pre-checking for an exception won't work because of a fundamental race condition. Same thing could apply to looking for a file on the file system, etc.</li>
<li>Given my CTO's propensity for drive-by management induced by reading technology columns in ""Inc."", I need a layer of indirection around the persistence mechanism so that I can throw out Hibernate and use Kodo, or whatever, without changing anything except the lowest layer of persistence code. As a matter of fact, there are several such layers of abstraction in my system. How can I prevent them from leaking in spite of unchecked exceptions?</li>
<li>One of the declaimed weaknesses of checked exceptions is having to ""handle"" them in every call on the stack&mdash;either by declaring that a calling method throws them, or by catching them and handling them. Handling them often means wrapping them in another checked exception of a type appropriate to the level of abstraction. So, for example, in checked-exception land, a file-system&ndash;based implementation of my UserRegistry might catch <code>IOException</code>, while a database implementation would catch <code>SQLException</code>, but both would throw a <code>UserNotFoundException</code> that hides the underlying implementation. How do I take advantage of unchecked exceptions, sparing myself of the burden of this wrapping at each layer, without leaking implementation details?</li>

<p>I am working on a site that will allow the user to download very large files (up to and exceeding 100GB)</p>

<p>What is the best way to do this <strong><em>without using FTP</em></strong>.  The end user must be able to download the file from there browser using HTTP.  I don't think Flash or Silverlight can save files to the client so as far as I know they won't cut it.</p>

<p>I'm guessing we will need an ActiveX or Java applet to pull this off.  Something like the download manager that MSDN uses.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a commercial (or free) component that will do that?  We do not want the user to have to install a ""browser wide"" download manager (like GetRight), we want it to only work with downloading on our site. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Here is some additional info to help clarify what I'm trying to do.  Most of the files above the 4GB limit would be large HD video files (its for a video editing company).  These will be downloaded by users across the internet, this isn't going to be people on a local network.  We want the files to be available via HTTP (some users are going to be behind firewalls that aren't going to allow FTP, Bittorrent, etc.).  The will be a library of files the end user could download, so we aren't talking about a one time large download.  The will be download different large files on a semi-regular basis.</p>

<p>So far Vault that @Edmund-Tay suggested is the closest solution so far.  The only problem is that it doesn't work for files larger than 4GB (it instantly fails before starting the download, they are probably using a 32bit integer somewhere that the content length of the file exceeds).</p>

<p>A java applet (or ActiveX component since the problem only exist in IE) that worked like the article @spoulson linked to would be the best solution, but so far I haven't had any luck finding one that does anything like that (multipart downloads, resume, etc.).</p>

<p>It looks like we might have to write our own.  Another option would be to write a .Net application (maybe ClickOnce) that is associated with an extension or mime type.  Then the user would actually be downloading a small file from the web server that opens in the exe/ClickOnce app that tells the application what file to download.  That is how the MSDN downloader works.  The end user would then only have to download/install an EXE once.  That would be better than downloading an exe every time they wanted to download a large file.</p>

Searching is performed through the <a href=""http://telharmonium.devjavu.com/browser/trunk/xmms2-model/src/se/fnord/xmms2/model/Collections.java"" rel=""nofollow"">Collections</a> interface (unfortunate namespace clash) which I'd rather move to Tracks, I think.</p>

<p>Any data can be modified by a third party at any time, and this should be properly reflected in the model and change-notifications distributed</p>

<p>These interfaces are exposed when connecting, by returning an object hierarchy that looks like this:</p>

<p>Some thoughts I've had were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Roll my own serializer using DataOutputStream</strong>:  This would give me the greatest control of what was in the file, but at the cost of micromanaging it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Straight old Serialization using ObjectOutputStream and its various related classes</strong>: I'm not sold on it though since I find the data brittle.  Changing any object's structure breaks the serialized instances of it.  So I'm locked in to what seems to be a horrible versioning nightmare.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>XML Serialization</strong>: It's not as brittle, but it's significantly slower that straight out serialization.  It can be transformed outside of my program.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>JavaDB</strong>: I'd considered this since I'm comfortable writing JDBC applications. The difference here is that the database instance would only persist while the file was being opened or saved.  It's not pretty but... it does lend itself to migrating to a central server architecture if the need arises later and it introduces the possibility of quering the datamodel in a simpler way.</p></li>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unfortunately, according to the Hibernate documentation ""Properties from superclasses not mapped as @MappedSuperclass are ignored.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well I think this means that if I have these two classes:</p>

<pre><code>public class A {
    private int foo;
}

@Entity
public class B extens A {
}
</code></pre>

<p>then field <code>foo</code> will not be mapped for class  B. Which makes sense. But if I have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
public class Problem {

@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
private Long id;

private String name;

public Long getId() {
    return id;
}

public void setId(Long id) {
    this.id = id;
}

public String getName() {
    return name;
}

public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
}
}

@Entity
public class UglyProblem extends Problem {

private int levelOfUgliness;

public int getLevelOfUgliness() {
    return levelOfUgliness;
}

public void setLevelOfUgliness(int levelOfUgliness) {
    this.levelOfUgliness = levelOfUgliness;
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>I expect the class UglyProblem to have fileds <code>id</code> and <code>name</code> and both classes to be mapped using same table. (In fact, this is exactly what happens, I have just checked again). I have got this table:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE ""problem"" (
    ""DTYPE"" varchar(31) NOT NULL,
    ""id"" bigint(20) NOT NULL auto_increment,
    ""name"" varchar(255) default NULL,

) AUTO_INCREMENT=2;
</code></pre>

<p>Going back to my question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I expect @ManyToOne person to be inherited by UglyProblem class.</p>

<p>I expect that because all other mapped fields are inherited and I do not see any reason to make this exception for ManyToOne relationships.</p>

I'm working as a Java developer on a team of 3 others. The company primarily sells a service to for businesses/business-type people to use in communicating with each other.</p>

<p>One of the main things I have been, and will be working on, is the main website for the company - from which the service is sold, existing users login to check their service and pay their bills, new users can sign up for a trial, etc. Currently this is a JSP application deployed on Tomcat, with access to a database done thru a persistence layer written by the company itself.</p>

<p>A repeated and growing frustration I am having here (and I'm pretty happy with the job overall, so this isn't an ""oh no I don't like my job""-type post) is the lack of any larger design or architecture for this web application. The app is made up of several dozen JSP pages, with almost no logic existing in Servlets or Beans or any other sort of framework. Many of the JSP pages are thousands of lines of code, they <code>jsp:include</code> other JSP pages, business logic is mixed in with the HTML, frequently used snippets of code (such as obtaining a web service connection) is cut and paste rather than reused, etc. In other words, the application is a mess.</p>

<p>There have been some rumblings within the company of trying to re-architect this site so that it fits MVC better; I think that the developers and higher-ups are beginning to realize that this current pattern of spaghetti code isn't sustainable or very easily scalable to add more features for the users. The higher-ups and developers are wary of completely re-writing the thing (with good reason, since this would mean several weeks or months of work re-writing existing functionality), but we've had some discussions of (slowly) re-writing certain areas of the site into a new framework.</p>

<p>What are some of the best strategies to enable moving the application and codebase into this direction? How can I as a developer really help move this along, and quickly, without seeming like the jerk-y new guy who comes into a job and tells everyone that what they've written is crap?

42828,1,63883,,9/3/2008 23:27,4,7635,"<p>I will elaborate somewhat. Jsf is kind-of extremely painful for working with from designer's perspective, somewhat in the range of trying to draw a picture while having hands tied at your back, but it is good for chewing up forms and listing lots of data. So sites we are making in my company are jsf admin pages and jsp user pages. Problem occurs when user pages have some complicated forms and stuff and jsf starts kickin' in. </p>

<p>Here is the question: I'm on pure jsp page. I need to access some jsf page that uses session bean. How can I initialize that bean? If I was on jsf page, I could have some commandLink which would prepare data. Only thing I can come up with is having dummy jsf page that will do the work and redirect me to needed jsf page, but that's kind of ugly, and I don't want to end up with 50 dummy pages. I would rather find some mechanism to reinitialize bean that is already in session with some wanted parameters.</p>

<p>Edit: some more details. In this specific situation, I have a tests that are either full or filtered. It's a same test with same logic and everything, except if test is filtered, it should eliminate some questions depending on answers. Upon a clicking a link, it should start a requested test in one of the two modes. Links are parts of main menu-tree and are visible on many sibling jsp pages. My task is to have 4 links: testA full, testA filtered, testB full, testB filtered, that all lead on same jsf page and TestFormBean should be reinitialized accordingly.</p>

<p>Edit: I've researched facelets a bit, and while it won't help me now, I'll definitely keep that in mind for next project.</p>

<p>The application need to prefetch a batch of 100 IDs from a sequence. It's relatively easy to do in a single-threaded, non-distributed environment, you can just issue these queries:</p>

<pre><code>select seq.nextval from dual;
alter sequence seq increment by 100;
select seq.nextval from dual;

<p>The first select fetches the first sequence ID that the application can use, the second select returns the last one that can be used.</p>

<p>Things get way more interesting in a multithreaded environment. You can't be sure that before the second select another thread doesn't increase the sequence by 100 again. This issue can be solved by synchronizing the access on the Java side - you only let one thread begin fetching the IDs at one time.</p>

<p>I have a page that pulls dynamic content from a javabean and passes the list of objects to a custom tag for processing into html. Within each object is a bunch of html to be output that contains a second custom tag that I would like to also be rendered. The problem is that the tag invocation is rendered as plaintext.</p>

<p>An example might serve me better.</p>

<p>1 Pull information from a database and return it to the page via a javabean. Send this info to a custom tag for outputting.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;jsp:useBean id=""ImportantNoticeBean"" scope=""page"" class=""com.mysite.beans.ImportantNoticeProcessBean""/&gt;  &lt;%-- Declare the bean --%&gt;
&lt;c:forEach var=""noticeBean"" items=""${ImportantNoticeBean.importantNotices}""&gt; &lt;%-- Get the info --%&gt;
    &lt;mysite:notice importantNotice=""${noticeBean}""/&gt; &lt;%-- give it to the tag for processing --%&gt;
&lt;/c:forEach&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>this tag should output a box div like so</p>

<pre><code>*SNIP* class for custom tag def and method setup etc
out.println(""&lt;div class=\""importantNotice\""&gt;"");
out.println(""   "" + importantNotice.getMessage());
out.println(""   &lt;div class=\""importantnoticedates\""&gt;Posted: "" + importantNotice.getDateFrom() + "" End: "" + importantNotice.getDateTo()&lt;/div&gt;"");
out.println(""   &lt;div class=\""noticeAuthor\""&gt;- "" + importantNotice.getAuthor() + ""&lt;/div&gt;"");
out.println(""&lt;/div&gt;"");
*SNIP*
</code></pre>

<p>This renders fine and as expected</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""importantNotice""&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a very important message. Everyone should pay attenton to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class=""importantnoticedates""&gt;Posted: 2008-09-08 End: 2008-09-08&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""noticeAuthor""&gt;- The author&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>2 If, in the above example, for instance, I were to have a custom tag in the importantNotice.getMessage() String:</p>

<pre><code>*SNIP* ""This is a very important message. Everyone should pay attenton to it. &lt;mysite:quote author=""Some Guy""&gt;Quote this&lt;/mysite:quote&gt;"" *SNIP*
</code></pre>

<p>The important notice renders fine but the quote tag will not be processed and simply inserted into the string and put as plain text/html tag.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""importantNotice""&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a very important message. Everyone should pay attenton to it. &lt;mysite:quote author=""Some Guy""&gt;Quote this&lt;/mysite:quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>We know we need to move away from this to be able to scale out by adding more machines to the cluster, and I'm in the early stages of working out exactly how we'll do this.</p>

<p>Right now I'm looking at Terracotta as a way of scaling out the Java code, but I haven't got as far as working out how to scale out the C++ to match.</p>

<p>As well as scaling for performance we need to consider high availability as well. The application needs to be available pretty much the whole time -- not absolutely 100%, which isn't cost effective, but we need to do a reasonable job of surviving a machine outage.</p>

<p>If you had to undertake the task I've been given, what would you do?</p>

The limit has to checked by the user comparing two iterators in the normal case the second iterator is the container end.</p>

<li>Callbacks from those control messages code paths that reach back from the server to the client (sidebar note - this is a side-effect of some legacy code and is not our long-term intent).</li>

<ol>
<li>LocateRegistry.getRegistry(1099) or Locate.createRegistry(1099) will ensure that the registry is listening in on 1099.</li>

As a result, I'm getting a mix of ports from the set of defaults and the user settings.

We are having a problem that may be specific to WebMethods, but if anyone can point me in a direction of what kinds of things might cause this I'd appreciate it.</p>

<p>When polling two of our partners' FTP servers, we connect without issue but, when doing a NLST on a directory that is empty (no files and no subdirectories) it's timing out.  The actual error is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>com.wm.net.ftpCException: [ISC.0064.9010] java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Accept timed out</p>

<p>It's being thrown during the invocation of the pub.client.ftp:ls service.  I've logged in with a number of FTP clients without a problem to the same sites.  I've used whatever the default FTP client is in windows, FileZilla and lftp.  All without issue.  The servers themselves aren't the same FTP server software from what I can tell.  One is Microsoft FTP, the other I'm uncertain on but is definitely not Microsoft.</p>

<p>Any idea what could cause an FTP client to timeout when waiting for a NLST response on an empty directory?  The visible responses from the FTP server appear to be the same, but is there a difference in how NLST responds for an empty directory that I'm unaware of?</p>

<p>This problem is consistent on these two servers.  Everything functions fine on directories with files or subdirectories within it, but not when empty.</p>

61150,1,61215,,9/14/2008 5:31,17,11292,"<p>My motto for Java is ""just because Java has static blocks, it doesn't mean that you should be using them."" Jokes aside, there are a lot of tricks in Java that make testing a nightmare. Two of the most I hate are Anonymous Classes and Static Blocks. We have a lot of legacy code that make use of Static Blocks and these are one of the annoying points in our push in writing unit tests. Our goal is to be able to write unit tests for classes that depend on this static initialization with minimal code changes. </p>

<p>So far my suggestion to my colleagues is to move the body of the static block into a private static method and call it <code>staticInit</code>. This method can then be called from within the static block. For unit testing another class that depends on this class could easily mock <code>staticInit</code> with JMockit to not do anything. Let's see this in example.</p>

<pre><code>public class ClassWithStaticInit {
  static {
    System.out.println(""static initializer."");
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Will be changed to</p>

<pre><code>public class ClassWithStaticInit {
  static {
    staticInit();
  }

  private static void staticInit() {
    System.out.println(""static initialized."");
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So that we can do the following in a JUnit.</p>

<pre><code>public class DependentClassTest {
  public static class MockClassWithStaticInit {
    public static void staticInit() {
    }
  }

  @BeforeClass
  public static void setUpBeforeClass() {
    Mockit.redefineMethods(ClassWithStaticInit.class, MockClassWithStaticInit.class);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However this solution also comes with its own problems. You can't run <code>DependentClassTest</code> and <code>ClassWithStaticInitTest</code> on the same JVM since you actually want the static block to run for <code>ClassWithStaticInitTest</code>.</p>

<p>What would be your way of accomplishing this task? Or any better, non-JMockit based solutions that you think would work cleaner?</p>

import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.ManyToOne;

  }

  @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)

    return bar;
  }

  public void setBar(Bar bar) {
    this.bar = bar;
  }

  private String title;

  public String getTitle() {
    return title;
  }

  public void setTitle(String title) {
    this.title = title;
  }

<p>Now when we load from the database an object from class Foo using session get e.g:</p>

<p>Foo foo = (Foo)session.get(Foo.class, 1 /* or some other id that exists in the DB*/);
the Bar member of foo is a proxy object (in our case javassist proxy but it can be cglib one depending on the bytecode provider you use), that is not initialized.
If you then use session.get to fetch the Bar object that is the member of the Foo class just loaded (we are in the same session), Hibernate does not issue another DB query and fetches the object from the session (first level) cache. The problem is this is a proxy to Bar class which is not initialized and trying to call this object getId() will return 0, and getTitle() will return null. 
Our current solution is pretty ugly and checks if the object returned from get is a proxy here is the code (form a generic DAO implementation):</p>

<pre><code>@SuppressWarnings(""unchecked"")
@Override
@Transactional(readOnly = true)
public &lt;T extends IEntity&gt; T get(Class&lt;T&gt; clazz, Serializable primaryKey) throws DataAccessException {
  T entity = (T) currentSession().get(clazz, primaryKey);
  if (entity != null) {
    if (LOG.isWarnEnabled()) {
      LOG.warn(""Object not found for class "" + clazz.getName() + "" with primary key "" + primaryKey);
    }
  } else if (entity instanceof HibernateProxy){ // TODO: force initialization due to Hibernate bug
    HibernateProxy proxy = (HibernateProxy)entity;
    if (!Hibernate.isInitialized(proxy)) {
      Hibernate.initialize(proxy);
    }
    entity = (T)proxy.getHibernateLazyInitializer().getImplementation();
  }
  return entity;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a better way to do this, couldn't find a solution in the Hibernate forum, and didn't find the issue in Hibernate's JIRA.</p>

<p>Note: we cannot just use foo.getBar() (which will initialize the proxy properly) to get the Bar class object, because the session.get operation to fetch the Bar object does not know (or care for that matter) that the Bar class is also a lazy member of a Foo object that was just fetched.</p>

<p>As you can see, several prefixes are defined for the same namespace, e.g. the namespace <a href=""http://example.com/schema/common"">http://example.com/schema/common</a> has the prefixes ns4, ns5, ns6, ns7 and ns8. Some long requests define several hundred prefixes for the same namespace.</p>

<p>This causes a problem with the <a href=""http://saxon.sourceforge.net/"">Saxon</a> XSLT processor, that I use to transform the requests. Saxon limits the the number of different prefixes for the same namespace to 255 and throws an exception when you define more prefixes.</p>

<pre><code>http://server/application?source=123&amp;destination=234&amp;text=hello
</code></pre>

<p>This request contains the ID of the sender, the ID of the recipient and the text of the message.</p>

<p>This message should be processed like:</p>

<ul>
<li>finding the matching User object for both the source and the destination from the database</li>
<li>creating a tree of objects: a Message that contains a field for the message text and two User objects for the source and the destination</li>
<li>persisting this tree to a database.</li>
</ul>

<p>The tree will be loaded by other applications that I can't touch.</p>

<p>I use Oracle as the backing database and JPA with Toplink for the database handling tasks. If possible, I'd stay with these.</p>

<p>Without much optimization I can achieve ~30 requests/sec throughput in my environment. That's not much, I'd require ~300 requests/sec. So I measured where the performance bottleneck is and found that the calls to <code>em.persist()</code> takes most of the time. If I simply comment out that line, the throughput go well over 1000 requests/sec.</p>

<p>I tried to write a small test application that used simple JDBC calls to persist 1 million messages to the same database. I used batching, meaning I did 100 inserts then a commit, and repeated until all the records was in the database. I measured ~500 requests/sec throughput in this scenario, that would meet my needs.</p>

<p>It is clear that I need to optimize insert performance here. However as I mentioned earlier I would like to keep using JPA and Toplink for this, not pure JDBC.</p>

<p>Do you know a way to create batch inserts with JPA and Toplink? Can you recommend any other technique for improving JPA persist performance?</p>

<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFO:</strong></p>

<p>""requests/sec"" means here: total number of requests / total time from beginning of test to last record written to database.</p>

<p>I tried to make the calls to <code>em.persist()</code> asynchronous by creating an in-memory queue between the servlet stuff and the persister. It helped the performance greatly. However the queue did grow really fast and as the application will receive ~200 requests/second continuously, It is not an acceptable solution for me.</p>

<p>In this decoupled approach I collected requests for 100 msec and called <code>em.persist()</code> on all collected items before commiting the transaction. The EntityManagerFactory is cached between each transaction.</p>

(Then again, he likes nice, small simple things with blinky lights that he can understand.)  He instinctively sees no issues with this, while I only see an endless series of problems and degradations.  Once I start talking to him about the complexity of our platform, and more in depth specifics of byte code, JVMs, libraries, differences between operating systems, processor architectures, etc...well...his eyes glaze over, he smiles and he has made it clear he thinks I'm being childishly resistive.</p>

<p>Why does he want a single magic executable?  He sees a couple of ""benefits"":</p>

<ul>
<li>If it is a binary executable, then it is hard to reverse engineer and circumvent any licensing.  Management lives in constant fear that this is happening, even though we sell into larger corporates who generally do not do cheat with server software.  </li>

    DefaultCodableEnum(String code) {
    	this.code = code;

    public abstract CodableEnum getByCode(String code);

<ol>
<li>An enum cannot extend a class</li>
<li>Elements of an enum (SKYPE, GOOGLE_TALK, etc.) cannot extend a class</li>
<li>I cannot provide a default implementation of getByCode(), because DefaultCodableEnum is not itself an Enum. I tried changing DefaultCodableEnum to extend java.lang.Enum, but this doesn't appear to be allowed.</li>

The system base should have support for finding out about plugins, starting them up and being able to provide ways for those modules to communicate.

It doesn't seem ready for prime time, though.  My ant script builds fine from the command line, but I get all these build errors because I need to tell Eclipse all this stuff the build.xml already has in it, like the CLASSPATH, and where external jars are.</li>
<li>When I leave Eclipse running for too long, or sometimes after my laptop wakes up from hibernate, the UI starts breaking.  For instance, the tabs on the editor pane disappear, so I can only edit one file at a time, and it doesn't say which one it is.</li>
<li>We have faced several instances where classes weren't rebuilt that should have been, leading to inaccurate line numbers in debugging walkthroughs and other unpredictable behavior (this isn't just me; the two other developers trying it out with me are seeing the same thing).</li>
<li>I find it a huge hassle that the workspace is in a different place than my source code.  I have other files I need to edit (xml files, etc), and for each directory I want to edit files in, I need to set up a special entry, and it doesn't even default to where my source code is when setting that up.</li>
</ol>

<p>Do others face these same issues?</p>

<p>At the moment the database schema is such that persons table has postal address columns, phone number columns as does organizations table. This is not a good way to handle this.</p>

<p>I've read the c2 Wiki on this and there's some good discussion regarding <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?ContactAndAddressModels"" rel=""nofollow"">Contact and address models (<a href=""http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?ContactAndAddressModels"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?ContactAndAddressModels</a>)</a> and wheter or not <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?ArePhysicalPostalAddressesArchaic"" rel=""nofollow"">physical addresses are archaic (<a href=""http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?ArePhysicalPostalAddressesArchaic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?ArePhysicalPostalAddressesArchaic</a>)</a>. These two discussions really opened my eyes on the scope of this problem.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about separating <b>contact information fields to separate table(s)</b>. But what's the best way to do this. At the moment the application mainly handles Finnish addresses but it's on the horizon that it needs also to handle international addresses. </p>

<p>I could define an ""addresses"" -table, a ""phone numbers"" -table, an ""email addresses"" -table and so on and these would be linked to people and organizations. But this just feels too much like the previous solution: it's inevitable that the predefined database schema isn't sufficient.</p>

<p>What I'm proposing is to create a contact information schema/program logic that is <b>dynamic</b>:</p>

<ul>
 <li>There are no predefined contact information fields/field sets</li>
 <li>Users can define new contact information types and required fields at any time like
  <ul>
   <li>Finnish postal address</li>
   <li>Swedish postal address</li>
   <li>... postal address</li>
   <li>Phone number</li>
   <li>Email address</li>
   <li>ICQ-number</li>
  
 </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Is this feasible?</b> Has anyone done anything like this? </p>

<p>There could be a table that defines contact information types:</p>

<h3>contact information types</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Id: Identifier</li>
 <li>Name: ""Finnish postal address""</li>
 <li>Description: ""Use this contact information type for finnish postal addresses""</li>
</ul>

<p><br/>
Then there could be a table that defines what fields are used per contact information type:</p>

<h3>contact information type fields</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Id: Identifier</li>
 <li>Contact_information_type_id: References the previous table</li>
 <li>Field title: ""Address line 1""</li>
 <li>Field description: ""Use this line for postal addresses' first line""</li>
 <li>Field type: String/Integer/etc.</li>
 <li>Field format: Regular expression for validating field data</li>
 <li>Field order: In which order should this field appear when displaying/using this contact information type</li>
</ul>

<p><br/>
Then we'd have a ""contact information table"" that just is used to map contact information fields together:</p>

<h3>contact information</h3>

<p><ul>
  <li>Id: Identifier</li>
  <li>Contact_information_type_id: References the contact information type table</li>
</ul></p>

<p><br/>
Then we'd have a ""contact information of person"" -table mapping different contact information to persons:</p>

<h3>contact information of person</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Id: Identifier</li>
 <li>Contact_information_id: References the contact information table</li>
 <li>Person id: References the person</li>
</ul>

<p><br/>
Then we'd need tables per contact information field type like:</p>

<h3>contact information integer fields</h3>

<p><li>Id: Identifier</li>
 <li>Contact_information_id: References the contact information table</li>
 <li>Value: The value of this field</li>
</ul>
<br/></p>

<p>and so on for strings etc...</p>

<p>Finally when displaying different contact information of a given person this would happen through <b>person's contact information</b> -table whis looks up what fields are used to form this contact information from <b>contact information type fields</b> -table through <b>contact information</b> -table. After determining what fields are used all the necessary tables would be joined together.</p>

<p>I'm having doubts about the feasibility of in SQL. Any thoughts?</p>

<p>In Java I probably could program some logic to determine what tables are neede to form a contact information entity and then i could use some sort of dynamic beans to represent this data in Java. But that's a bit foggy to me too. Anyt thoughts on this too?</p>

Also, it's not that big, less than 5,000 lines.</p>

<p>I ended up translating the part of the library that I needed to Java. It's about 10% of the library so far, though it'll probably increase with time.

The app will run on the device and should make use of the functions provided by our SDK/J and will be judged from marketing and support (my department). They will use an emulator for the first step and will be provided with a real device if they qualify for the finals.</p>

While I could put the pattern in a resource properties file, the code and the pattern need to know intimate details about each other. With an EL-like system, the contract between the code and the pattern would be at a much higher level (e.g. customer and order, rather then customer.firstName and order.estimatedDispatchDate), making it easier to change the structure, order and contents of the message without changing any code.</p>

I can deal with concurrency issues between threads on the same machine fairly easily, but what about concurrency on the same data on different machines?  </p>

<p>Essentially the software receives requests to feed a customer's data from one business to another via web services.  However, the customer may or may not exist yet on the other system.

I've been pretty lazy about ""getting it done"" and more concerned about upfront optimization, lean code, and proper design patterns. Mostly a self-teaching experiment. I am interested in what patterns more experienced designers think are relevant, or what type of pseudocoded object architecture would be the best, easiest to maintain and so on.</p>

<p>There can be 500,000 events in a single log, and there are about 60 types of events, all of which share about 7 base properties and then have 0 to 15 additional properties depending on the event type. The type of event is the 2nd property in the log file in each line.</p>

<p>So for I've tried a really ugly imperative parser that walks through the log line by line and then processes events line by line. Then I tried a lexical specification that uses a ""nextEvent"" pattern, which is called in a loop and processed. Then I tried a plain old ""parse"" method that never returns and just fires events to registered listener callbacks. I've tried both a single callback regardless of event type, and a callback method specific to each event type.</p>

<p>I've tried a base ""event"" class with a union of all possible properties. I've tried to avoid the ""new Event"" call (since there can be a huge number of events and the event objects are generally short lived) and having the callback methods per type with primitive property arguments. I've tried having a subclass for each of the 60 event types with an abstract Event parent with the 7 common base properties.</p>

<p>I recently tried taking that further and using a Command pattern to put event handling code per event type. I am not sure I like this and its really similar to the callbacks per type approach, just code is inside an execute function in the type subclasses versus the callback methods per type. </p>

<p>The problem is that alot of the model updating logic is shared, and alot of it is specific to the subclass, and I am just starting to get confused about the whole thing. I am hoping someone can at least point me in a direction to consider!</p>

Similarly, any client application may send packets to the serial device, via the Smack API.  Packets are just byte arrays, and limited is size to around 100 bytes, so they can be converted to hex strings and sent as text in the body of a message.  The system should be tolerant of the clients/serial device going offline, meaning they will automatically reconnect when they are available again, but packets will be discarded if the client is offline.  The packets must be sent and received in near real-time, so offline delivery is not desired.  Security should be provided by messaging system and provided client API.</p>

<p>I know that generics allow you to reduce casting but they do so at the expense of making declaration more difficult. To me, the benefit of generics is that they allow you to have the complier enforce more rules -- not they they reduce casting (but I haven't used them much so I am somewhat uninformed). This proposal would only reduce the amount of code to type, not move it to another place.
Also there are instances where generics can't be used because a collection can have different objectis.

<pre><code>for(Iterator i = list.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>because</p>

<ul>
<li>It is shorter</li>
<li>It keeps i in a smaller scope</li>
<li>It reduces the chance of  confusion. (Is i used outside the
while? Where is i declared?)</li>
</ul>

<p>I think code should be as simple to understand as possible so that I only have to make complex code to do complex things. What do you think? Which is better?</p>

<p>To be more specific, I'm writing application which runs across many computers and sends/receives data from one to another. I feel more comfortable to have separate thread for each connected machine and task, like 1) sending data, 2) receiving data, 3) reestablishing connection when it is dropped. So, given that there are N nodes in cluster, each machine is going to have 3 threads for each of N-1 neighbours. Typically there will be 12 machines, which comes to 33 communication threads.</p>

<p>Most of those threads will be sleeping most of the time, so for optimization purposes I could reduce number of threads and give more job to each of them.

<p>The consumed memory isn't Java heap memory---my example program (below) shows that Java memory stays roughly static at around 185,000 bytes---but there is some kind of memory leak in the underlying supporting library provided by Nokia; I believe the memory leak occurs because if you try and start another (non-Java) application (e.g. web browser) after running the Java application for a while, the phone kills that application with a warning about lack of memory.</p>

<p>I've tried several different approaches from that taken by Sun's canonical example in the documentation (initialize everything each time round the loop, initialize as much as possible only once, call as many of the deallocate-style functions which shouldn't be strictly necessary etc.). None appear to be successful. Below is a simple example program which I believe should work, but crashes after running for 15 minutes or so on both the N80 (despite a firmware update) and N95.

<p>These passwords won't change (because then our partners would have to make coding/config changes to change them and coordinating password expirations with hundreds of partners for multiple environments would be a nightmare) and they don't have to be entered by a human or human readable.

<p>Here are some of the obvious solutions, and why they don't work:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use a different Random class in the thirdparty classfiles. The problem here is I only load the class files, and cannot modify the source.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a custom classloader to load our own Random class instead of the JVM's version. This approach will not work because Java does not allow classloaders to override classes in the <code>java</code> package.</p></li>
<li><p>Swap out the rt.jar's <code>java.util.Random</code> implementation for our own, or putting files into trusted locations for the JVM. These approaches require the user of the application messing with the JVM install on their machine, and are no good.</p></li>
<li><p>Adding a custom <code>java.util.Random</code> class to the bootclasspath. While this would technically work, for this particular application, it is impractical because this application is intended for end users to run from an IDE.

<p>(I have a hunch that DynamicProxy thingy might be a solution, but reading documentation on Sun's site wasn't very helpful, so if it really is something in that direction, some clarification would be appreciated)</p>

<p>Edit: I asked wrong question, sorry (some misunderstanding between me and coworker what is actually a problem). Problem occurs because of deserializing. So once I have date in xml format it tries to deserialize itself as GregorianCalendar. Other part of a question still remains: What is the best way to receive something (long timestamp or GregorianCalendar) and convert it to sql date, without making 10 different wrappers for 10 different classes. I'm using a NetBeans for code and wsdl generation. </p>

<p>I am familiar with the <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/media/jmf/"">Java Media Framework</a> and, sadly, I think we can consider that an effectively dead API.  I am also familiar with <a href=""http://www.axis.com/"">Axis boxes</a> and, while I really like their solution, I would appreciate any critical feedback on my specific points of interest.  </p>

<p>This is how I define ""best"" for the purpose of this discussion:</p>

<ul>
<li>Latency - if I'm controlling the camera using this video stream, I would like to keep my round-trip latency at less than 100 milliseconds if possible.  That's measured as the time between my control input to the time when I see the visible change.  EDIT some time later: another thing to keep in mind is that camera control is likely to be a combination of manual and automatic (event triggers).  We need to see those pictures right away, even if the high quality feed is archived separately.</li>
<li>Cost - free / open source is better than not free.</li>
<li>Adjustable codec parameters - I need to be able to tune the codec for certain situations.  Sometimes a high-speed low-resolution stream is actually easier to process.</li>
<li>""Integration"" with Java - how much trouble is it to hook this solution to my code?  Am I sending packets over a socket?  Hitting URLs?  Installing Direct3D / JNI combinations?</li>
<li>Windows / Linux / both? - I would prefer an operating system agnostic solution because I have to deliver to several flavors of OS but there may be a solution that is optimal for one but not the other.</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: I am aware of other image / video capture codecs and that is not the focus of this question.  I am specifically <em>not</em> interested in streaming APIs (e.g., MPEG4) due to the loss of frame accuracy.  However, if there is a solution to my question that delivers another frame-accurate data stream, please chime in.</p>

<p>Follow-up to this question: at this point, I am strongly inclined to buy appliances such as the <a href=""http://www.axis.com/products/video/video_server/index.htm"">Axis video encoders</a> rather than trying to capture the video in software or on the PC directly.  However, if someone has alternatives, I'd love to hear them.</p>

<p>This seems to be specific to Java creating threads, as the C thread-limit program was able to create about 1.5k threads. Additionally, this doesn't happen with a Java 1.4 JVM... it can create over 1.4k threads, though they are obviously being handled differently with respect to the OS.</p>

<p>In this case, the number of threads it's cutting off at is a mere 29 threads.

<p>This seems to be unaffected by things such as the number of threads in use by other processes or users or the total amount of memory the system is using at the time.

<p>Is there anything like this? Or anything similar, not necessary for Future. Currently I loop through collection of futures, check if one is finished, then sleep for some time and check again. This looks like not the best solution, because if I sleep for long period then unwanted delay is added, if I sleep for short period then it can affect performance.</p>

<p>I could try using </p>

<pre><code>new CountDownLatch(1)
</code></pre>

<p>and decrease countdown when task is complete and do </p>

<pre><code>countdown.await()

<p>, but I found it possible only if I control Future creation. It is possible, but requires system redesign, because currently logic of tasks creation (sending Callable to ExecutorService) is separated from decision to wait for which Future. I could also override </p>

<pre><code>&lt;T&gt; RunnableFuture&lt;T&gt; AbstractExecutorService.newTaskFor(Callable&lt;T&gt; callable)
</code></pre>

<p>and create custom implementation of RunnableFuture with ability to attach listener to be notified when task is finished, then attach such listener to needed tasks and use CountDownLatch, but that means I have to override newTaskFor for every ExecutorService I use - and potentially there will be implementation which do not extend AbstractExecutorService. I could also try wrapping given ExecutorService for same purpose, but then I have to decorate all methods producing Futures.</p>

<p>All these solutions may work but seem very unnatural. It looks like I'm missing something simple, like </p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Originally I did not have access to Future creation at all, so there were no elegant solution. After redesigning system I got access to Future creation and was able to add countDownLatch.countdown() to execution process, then I can countDownLatch.await() and everything works fine.
Thanks for other answers, I did not know about ExecutorCompletionService and it indeed can be helpful in similar tasks, but in this particular case it could not be used because some Futures are created without any executor - actual task is sent to another server via network, completes remotely and completion notification is received.</p>

<p>With that toolkit you can write code using beans, like:</p>

<pre><code>@FixedLengthRecord()
public class Customer {
    @FieldFixedLength(4)
    public Integer custId;

    @FieldAlign(alignMode=AlignMode.Right)
    @FieldFixedLength(20)
    public String name;

    @FieldFixedLength(3)
    public Integer rating;

    @FieldTrim(trimMode=TrimMode.Right)
    @FieldFixedLength(10)
    @FieldConverter(converter = ConverterKind.Date, 
    format = ""dd-MM-yyyy"")
    public Date addedDate;

    @FieldFixedLength(3)
    @FieldOptional
    public String stockSimbol;  
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then just parse your text files using:</p>

<pre><code>FileHelperEngine&lt;Customer&gt; engine = 
    new FileHelperEngine&lt;Customer&gt;(Customer.class); 
List&lt;Customer&gt; customers = 
    new ArrayList&lt;Customer&gt;();

customers = engine.readResource(
    ""/samples/customers-fixed.txt"");

        &lt;field name=""balance""&gt;-0.96&lt;/field&gt;

<p>Your Java/Data Pipeline code would be:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) throws Throwable {
    String in = ""example/data/input/WriteCsvToXmlUsingFreeMarkerTemplates.csv"";
    String out = ""example/data/output/WriteCsvToXmlUsingFreeMarkerTemplates.xml"";

    writer.setFieldNamesInFirstRow(false);
    writer.getConfiguration().setDirectoryForTemplateLoading(new File(""example/data/input""));
    writer.setHeaderTemplate(""WriteAnXmlFileUsingFreeMarkerTemplates-header-2.xml"");

    writer.setDetailTemplate(""WriteAnXmlFileUsingFreeMarkerTemplates-detail-2.xml"");

    JobTemplate.DEFAULT.transfer(reader, writer);
}

<p>Finally, here's what the template files would contain.</p>

<p><strong>WriteAnXmlFileUsingFreeMarkerTemplates-header-2.xml:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""no""?&gt;
&lt;records&gt;

<p><strong>WriteAnXmlFileUsingFreeMarkerTemplates-footer-2.xml:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;record&gt;
        &lt;#list record.fieldNames as fieldName&gt;
        &lt;field name=""${fieldName}""&gt;${record.getField(fieldName).getValue()}&lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;/#list&gt;
&lt;/record&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>WriteAnXmlFileUsingFreeMarkerTemplates-detail-2.xml:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;/records&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Another option for the detail template file would be to use specific tags:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;actor stage-name=""${stageName}"" real-name=""${realName}""&gt;
        &lt;gender&gt;${gender}&lt;/gender&gt;
        &lt;city&gt;${city}&lt;/city&gt;
        &lt;#if (balance &gt;= 0)&gt;
                &lt;balance&gt;${balance}&lt;/balance&gt;
        &lt;/#if&gt;          
&lt;/actor&gt;

I suggest the incendiary article by Allen Holub ""<a href=""http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-09-2003/jw-0905-toolbox.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Getters And Setters Are Evil</a>"". Granted, the title is for shock value, but the author makes valid points.</p>

<p>Essentially, if you have getters and setters for each and every private field, you are making those fields as good as public. You'd be very hard-pressed to change the type of a private field without ripple effects to every class that calls that getter.</p>

<p>Moreover, from a strictly OO point of view, objects should be responding to messages (methods) that correspond to their (hopefully) single responsibility. The vast majority of getters and setters don't make sense for their constituent objects; Pen.dispenseInkOnto(Surface) makes more sense to me than Pen.getColor().</p>

<p>Getters and setters also encourage users of the class to ask the object for some data, perform a calculation, and then set some other value in the object, better known as procedural programming. You'd be better served to simply tell the object to do what you were going to in the first place; also known as the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_%28object-oriented_design%29#Information_Expert"" rel=""nofollow"">Information Expert</a> idiom.</p>

<p>Getters and setters, however, are necessary evils at the boundary of layers -- UI, persistence, and so forth. Restricted access to a class's internals, such as C++'s friend keyword, Java's package protected access, .NET's internal access, and the <a href=""http://moffdub.wordpress.com/2008/09/17/friend-classes-in-java-and-c-sharp/"" rel=""nofollow"">Friend Class Pattern</a> can help you reduce the visibility of getters and setters to only those who need them.</p>

<p>int is one of the few primitives in Java (along with char and some others).

So Integer is a fancy way to work with an int (Just as perhaps String is a fancy way to work with a group of chars).</p>

608,2,,564,8/3/2008 2:32,15,,"<p>I'll add to the excellent answers given above, and talk about boxing and unboxing, and how this applies to Java (although C# has it too). I'll use just Java terminology, because I am more <em>au fait</em> with that.</p>

<p>As the answers mentioned, <code>int</code> is just a number (called the <em>unboxed</em> type), whereas <code>Integer</code> is an object (which contains the number, hence a <em>boxed</em> type). In Java terms, that means (apart from not being able to call methods on <code>int</code>), you cannot store <code>int</code> or other non-object types in collections (<code>List</code>, <code>Map</code>, etc.). In order to store them, you must first box them up in its corresponding boxed type.</p>

<p>Java 5 onwards have something called <em>auto-boxing</em> and <em>auto-unboxing</em> which allow the boxing/unboxing to be done behind the scenes. Compare and contrast: Java 5 version:</p>

<pre><code>Deque&lt;Integer&gt; queue;<br><br>void add(int n) {<br>    queue.add(n);<br>}<br><br>int remove() {<br>    return queue.remove();<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>Java 1.4 or earlier (no generics either):</p>

<pre><code>Deque queue;<br><br>void add(int n) {<br>    queue.add(Integer.valueOf(n));<br>}<br><br>int remove() {<br>    return ((Integer) queue.remove()).intValue();<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>It must be noted that despite the brevity in the Java 5 version, both versions generate identical bytecode. Thus, although auto-boxing and auto-unboxing is very convenient because you write less code, these operations <em>do</em> happen behind the scenes, with the same runtime costs, so you still have to be aware of their existence.</p>

1266,2,,564,8/4/2008 14:11,15,,"<p>I'll just post here since some of the other posts are slightly inaccurate in relation to C#.</p>

<p>Correct: int is an alias for System.Int32. <br>
Wrong: float is not an alias for System.Float, but for System.Single</p>

<p>Basically, int is a reserved keyword in the C# programming language, and is an alias for the System.Int32 value type.</p>

<p>float and Float is not the same however, as the right system type for ''float'' is System.Single. There are some types like this that has reserved keywords that doesn't seem to match the type names directly.</p>

<p>In C# there is no difference between ''int'' and ''System.Int32'', or any of the other pairs or keywords/system types, except for when defining enums. With enums you can specify the storage size to use and in this case you can only use the reserved keyword, and not the system runtime type name.</p>

<p>Wether the value in the int will be stored on the stack, in memory, or as a referenced heap object depends on the context and how you use it.</p>

<p>This declaration in a method:</p>

<pre><code>int i;<br></code></pre>

<p>defines a variable <em>i</em> of type System.Int32, living in a register or on the stack, depending on optimizations. The same declaration in a type (struct or class) defines a member field. The same declaration in a method argument list defines a parameter, with the same storage options as for a local variable. (note that this paragraph is not valid if you start pulling iterator methods into the mix, these are different beasts altogether)</p>

<p>To get a heap object, you can use boxing:</p>

<pre><code>object o = i;<br></code></pre>

<p>this will create a boxed copy of the contents of <em>i</em> on the heap. In IL you can access methods on the heap object directly, but in C# you need to cast it back to an int, which will create another copy. Thus, the object on the heap cannot easily be changed in C# without creating a new boxed copy of a new int value.

<p>In Java, Integer objects with the values -128 to 127 are immutable (that is, for one particular integer value, say 23, all Integer objects instantiated through your program with the value 23 points to the <em>exact</em> same object).</p>

<p>Example, this returns true:</p>

<pre><code>Integer i1 = new Integer(127);<br>Integer i2 = new Integer(127);<br>System.out.println(i1 == i2); //  true<br></code></pre>

<p>While this returns false:</p>

<pre><code>Integer i1 = new Integer(128);<br>Integer i2 = new Integer(128);<br>System.out.println(i1 == i2); //  false<br></code></pre>

<p>The == compares by reference (does the variables point to the same object).</p>

<p>This result may or may not differ depending on what JVM you are using. The specification autoboxing for Java 1.5 requires that integers (-128 to 127) always box to the same wrapper object. </p>

<p>A solution? =) One should always use the Integer.equals() method when comparing Integer objects.</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println(i1.equals(i2)); //  true<br></code></pre>

<p>Primitive values do not share state with other primitive values. A variable whose type is a primitive type always holds a primitive value of that type.</p>

<pre><code>int aNumber = 4;
int anotherNum = aNumber;
aNumber += 6;
System.out.println(anotherNum); // Prints 4
</code></pre>

<p>An object is a dynamically created class instance or an array. The reference values (often just references) are pointers to these objects and a special null reference, which refers to no object. There may be many references to the same object.</p>

<pre><code>Integer aNumber = Integer.valueOf(4);
Integer anotherNumber = aNumber; // anotherNumber references the 
                                 // same object as aNumber
</code></pre>

<p>Also in Java everything is passed by value. With objects the value that is passed is the reference to the object. So another difference between int and Integer in java is how they are passed in method calls. For example in</p>

<pre><code>public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
final int two = 2;
int sum = add(1, two);
</code></pre>

<p>The variable <em>two</em> is passed as the primitive integer type 2. Whereas in</p>

<pre><code>public int add(Integer a, Integer b) {
    return a.intValue() + b.intValue();
}
final Integer two = Integer.valueOf(2);
int sum = add(Integer.valueOf(1), two);

<p>The variable <em>two</em> is passed as a reference to an object that holds the integer value 2.</p>

Pass by reference would work like so:</p>

<pre><code>public void increment(int x) {

}
int a = 1;
increment(a);
// a is now 2

<p>When increment is called it passes a reference (pointer) to variable <em>a</em>. And the <em>increment</em> function directly modifies variable <em>a</em>.</p>

<p>And for object types it would work as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public void increment(Integer x) {
  x = Integer.valueOf(x.intValue() + 1);

<pre><code>&lt;synth&gt;<br>    &lt;style id=""button""&gt;<br>        &lt;font name=""DIALOG"" size=""12"" style=""BOLD""/&gt;<br>        &lt;state value=""MOUSE_OVER""&gt;<br>            &lt;imagePainter method=""buttonBackground"" path=""dirt.png"" sourceInsets=""2 2 2 2""/&gt;<br>            &lt;insets top=""2"" botton=""2"" right=""2"" left=""2""/&gt;<br>        &lt;/state&gt;<br>        &lt;state value=""ENABLED""&gt;<br>            &lt;imagePainter method=""buttonBackground"" path=""dirt.png"" sourceInsets=""2 2 2 2""/&gt;<br>            &lt;insets top=""2"" botton=""2"" right=""2"" left=""2""/&gt;<br>        &lt;/state&gt;<br>    &lt;/style&gt;<br>    &lt;bind style=""button"" type=""name"" key=""dirt""/&gt;<br>&lt;/synth&gt;<br></code></pre>

<p>The bind element there specifies what to map to (in this example, it will apply that styling to any buttons whose name property has been set to ""dirt"").</p>

<p>Here is a quick and dirty way to extend the existing JButton class to draw a circle to the right of the text.</p>

<pre><code>package test;<br><br>import java.awt.Color;<br>import java.awt.Container;<br>import java.awt.Dimension;<br>import java.awt.FlowLayout;<br>import java.awt.Graphics;<br><br>import javax.swing.JButton;<br>import javax.swing.JFrame;<br><br>public class MyButton extends JButton {<br><br>    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;<br><br>    private Color circleColor = Color.BLACK;<br><br>    public MyButton(String label) {<br>        super(label);<br>    }<br><br>    @Override<br>    protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {<br>        super.paintComponent(g);<br><br>        Dimension originalSize = super.getPreferredSize();<br>        int gap = (int) (originalSize.height * 0.2);<br>        int x = originalSize.width + gap;<br>        int y = gap;<br>        int diameter = originalSize.height - (gap * 2);<br><br>        g.setColor(circleColor);<br>        g.fillOval(x, y, diameter, diameter);<br>    }<br><br>    @Override<br>    public Dimension getPreferredSize() {<br>        Dimension size = super.getPreferredSize();<br>        size.width += size.height;<br>        return size;<br>    }<br><br>    /*Test the button*/<br>    public static void main(String[] args) {<br>        MyButton button = new MyButton(""Hello, World!"");<br><br>        JFrame frame = new JFrame();<br>        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);<br>        frame.setSize(400, 400);<br><br>        Container contentPane = frame.getContentPane();<br>        contentPane.setLayout(new FlowLayout());<br>        contentPane.add(button);<br><br>        frame.setVisible(true);<br>    }<br><br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>Note that by overriding <strong>paintComponent</strong> that the contents of the button can be changed, but that the border is painted by the <strong>paintBorder</strong> method. The <strong>getPreferredSize</strong> method also needs to be managed in order to dynamically support changes to the content. Care needs to be taken when measuring font metrics and image dimensions.</p>

<p>For creating a control that you can rely on, the above code is not the correct approach. Dimensions and colours are dynamic in Swing and are dependent on the look and feel being used. Even the default <em>Metal</em> look has changed across JRE versions. It would be better to implement <strong>AbstractButton</strong> and conform to the guidelines set out by the Swing API. A good starting point is to look at the <strong>javax.swing.LookAndFeel</strong> and <strong>javax.swing.UIManager</strong> classes.</p>

<p><a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/swing/LookAndFeel.html"">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/swing/LookAndFeel.html</a></p>

2245,2,,2158,8/5/2008 13:03,47,,"<p>When I was first learning Java we had to make Yahtzee and I thought it would be cool to create custom Swing components and containers instead of just drawing everything on one JPanel.  The benefit of extending Swing components, of course, is to have the ability to add support for keyboard shortcuts and other accessibility features that you can't do just by having a paint() method print a pretty picture.  It may not be done the best way however, but it may be a good starting point for you.</p>

<p>Edit 8/6 - If it wasn't apparent from the images, each Die is a button you can click. This will move it to the DiceContainer below.  Looking at the source code you can see that each Die button is drawn dynamically, based on its value.</p>

<p>Here are the basic steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a class that extends JComponent</li>
<li>Call parent constructor super() in your constructors</li>
<li>Make sure you class implements MouseListener</li>
<li><p>Put this in the constructor:</p>

<pre><code>enableInputMethods(true);   
addMouseListener(this);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Override these methods:</p>

<pre><code>public Dimension getPreferredSize()  
public Dimension getMinimumSize()  
public Dimension getMaximumSize()
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Override this method:</p>

<pre><code>public void paintComponent(Graphics g)
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>The amount of space you have to work with when drawing your button is defined by getPreferredSize(), assuming getMinimumSize() and getMaximumSize() return the same value.  I haven't experimented too much with this but, depending on the layout you use for your GUI your button could look completely different.</p>

  <p>How do I figure out what the configuration settings (e.g. baud rate) should be...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read the datasheet? Ok, ok. Seriously, last one. If you don't know the baud rate of the device you are trying to communicate with, you have two choices. Start guessing, or possibly bust out an o-scope. If you need a good starting point, let me suggest 9600-8-N-1. My suspicion is you can get there with brute force relatively quickly. There's a third option of having an old-school ninja who can tell just by the LOOK of the garbled characters at some standard baud rate what actual baud rate is. An impressive party trick to be sure.</p>

<p>Hopefully though you have access to this information. In unix/linux, you can get ahold of minicom to play with the serial port directly. This should make it fairly quick to get the configuration figured out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>one of the major Unix shells</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Unix the serial port(s) is/are file-mapped into the /dev/ subdir. ttyS0, for example. If you setup the correct baud rate and whatnot using minicom, you can even cat stuff to that file to send stuff out there.</p>

<p>On to the meat of the question, you can access it programmatically through the POSIX headers. termios.h is the big one. </p>

<p>First, the <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html"">NPE JavaDoc</a> explicitly lists the cases where NPE is appropriate.  Notice that all of them are thrown <i>by the runtime</i> when <code>null</code> is used inappropriately.  In contrast, the <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/IllegalArgumentException.html"">IAE JavaDo</a>c couldn't be more clear: ""Thrown to indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument.""  Yup, that's you!</p>

<p>Second, when you see an NPE in a stack trace, what do you assume?  Probably that someone dereferenced a null.  When you see IAE, you assume the caller of the method at the top of the stack passed in an illegal value.  Again, the latter assumption is true, the former is misleading.</p>

<p>Third, since IAE is clearly designed for validating parameters, you have to assume it as the default choice of exception, so why would you choose NPE instead?  Certainly not for different behavior -- do you really expect calling code to catch NPE's separately from IAE and do something different as a result?  Are you trying to communicate a more specific error message?  But you can do that in the exception message text anyway, as you should for all other incorrect parameters.</p>

<p>Fourth, all other incorrect parameter data will be IAE, so why not be consistent?  Why is it that an illegal <code>null</code> is so special that it deserves a separate exception from all other types of illegal arguments?</p>

<p>Finally, I accept the argument given by other answers that parts of the Java API use NPE in this manner.  However, the Java API is inconsistent with everything from exception types to naming conventions, so I think just blindly copying (your favorite part) of the Java API isn't a good enough argument to trump these other considerations.</p>

<ul>
<li>It is more specific about the nature of the illegal operation</li>
<li>Logic that mistakenly allows nulls tends to be very different from logic that mistakenly allows illegal values. For example, if I'm validating data entered by a user, if I get value that is unacceptable, the source of that error is with the end user of the application. If I get a null, that's programmer error.</li>
<li>Invalid values can cause things like stack overflows, out of memory errors, parsing exceptions, etc. Indeed, most errors generally present, at some point, as an invalid value in some method call. For this reason I see IAE as actually the <em>MOST GENERAL</em> of all exceptions under RuntimeException.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Actually, other invalid arguments can result in all kinds of other exceptions. <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/UnknownHostException.html"">UnknownHostException</a>, <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/FileNotFoundException.html"">FileNotFoundException</a>, a variety of syntax error exceptions, <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/IndexOutOfBoundsException.html"">IndexOutOfBoundsException</a>, authentication failures, etc., etc.</p></li>

That, plus the JDK's failure to populate NPE's with a message string really has created a strong negative sentiment that isn't well founded.

14104551,2,,3881,12/31/2012 17:44,2,,"<p>Actually, the question of throwing IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException is in my humble view only a ""holy war"" for a minority with an incomlete understanding of exception handling in Java. In general, the rules are simple, and as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>argument constraint violations must be indicated as fast as possible (-> fast fail), in order to avoid illegal states which are much harder to debug</li>
<li>in case of an invalid null pointer for whatever reason, throw NullPointerException</li>
<li>in case of an illegal array/collection index, throw ArrayIndexOutOfBounds</li>
<li>in case of a negative array/collection size, throw NegativeArraySizeException</li>
<li>in case of an illegal argument that is not covered by the above, and for which you don't have another more specific exception type, throw IllegalArgumentException as a wastebasket</li>
<li>on the other hand, in case of a constraint violation WITHIN A FIELD that could not be avoided by fast fail for some valid reason, catch and rethrow as IllegalStateException or a more specific checked exception. Never let pass the original NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBounds, etc in this case!</li>
</ul>

<p>There are at least three very good reasons against the case of mapping all kinds of argument constraint violations to IllegalArgumentException, with the third probably being so severe as to mark the practice bad style:</p>

<p>(1) A programmer cannot a safely assume that all cases of argument constraint violations result in IllegalArgumentException, because the large majority of standard classes use this exception rather as a wastebasket if there is no more specific kind of exception available. Trying to map all cases of argument constraint violations to IllegalArgumentException in your API only leads to programmer frustration using your classes, as the standard libraries mostly follow different rules that violate yours, and most of your API users will use them as well!</p>

<p>(2) Mapping the exceptions actually results in a different kind of anomaly, caused by single inheritance: All Java exceptions are classes, and therefore support single inheritance only. Therefore, there is no way to create an exception that is truly say both a NullPointerException and an IllegalArgumentException, as subclasses can only inherit from one or the other. Throwing an IllegalArgumentException in case of a null argument therefore makes it harder for API users to distinguish between problems whenever a program tries to programmatically correct the problem, for example by feeding default values into a call repeat!</p>

<p>(3) Mapping actually creates the danger of bug masking: In order to map argument constraint violations into IllegalArgumentException, you'll need to code an outer try-catch within every method that has any constrained arguments. However, simply catching RuntimeException in this catch block is out of the question, because that risks mapping documented RuntimeExceptions thrown by libery methods used within yours into IllegalArgumentException, even if they are no caused by argument constraint violations. So you need to be very specific, but even that effort doesn't protect you from the case that you accidentally map an undocumented runtime exception of another API (i.e. a bug) into an IllegalArgumentException of your API. Even the most careful mapping therefore risks masking programming errors of other library makers as argument constraint violations of your method's users, which is simply hillareous behavior!</p>

<p>With the standard practice on the other hand, the rules stay simple, and exception causes stay unmasked and specific. For the method caller, the rules are easy as well:
- if you encounter a documented runtime exception of any kind because you passed an illegal value, either repeat the call with a default (for this specific exceptions are neccessary), or correct your code
- if on the other hand you enccounter a runtime exception that is not documented to happen for a given set of arguments, file a bug report to the method's makers to ensure that either their code or their documentation is fixed.</p>

79845,2,,4080,9/17/2008 4:02,49,,"<p>For static analysis tools I often use CPD, <a href=""http://pmd.sourceforge.net"">PMD</a>, <a href=""http://findbugs.sourceforge.net"">FindBugs</a>, and <a href=""http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net"">Checkstyle</a>.</p>

<p><p>CPD is the PMD ""Copy/Paste Detector"" tool. I was using PMD for a little while before I noticed the <a href=""http://pmd.sourceforge.net/cpd.html"">""Finding Duplicated Code"" link</a> on the <a href=""http://pmd.sourceforge.net"">PMD web page</a>.</p>

<p><p>I'd like to point out that these tools can sometimes be extended beyond their ""out-of-the-box"" set of rules. And not just because they're open source so that you can rewrite them. Some of these tools come with applications or ""hooks"" that allow them to be extended. For example, PMD comes with the <a href=""http://pmd.sourceforge.net/howtowritearule.html"">""designer"" tool</a> that allows you to create new rules. Also, Checkstyle has the <a href=""http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_misc.html#DescendantToken"">DescendantToken</a> check that has properties that allow for substantial customization.</p>

<p><p>I integrate these tools with <a href=""http://virtualteamtls.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/virtualteamtls/trunk/scm/common.xml?view=markup"">an Ant-based build</a>. You can follow the link to see my commented configuration.</p>

<p><p>In addition to the simple integration into the build, I find it helpful to configure the tools to be somewhat ""integrated"" in a couple of other ways. Namely, report generation and warning suppression uniformity. I'd like to add these aspects to this discussion (which should probably have the ""static-analysis"" tag also): how are folks configuring these tools to create a ""unified"" solution? (I've asked this question separately <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/79918/configuring-static-analysis-tools-for-uniformity"">here</a>)</p>

<p><p>First, for warning reports, I transform the output so that each warning has the simple format:</p>

<pre><code>/absolute-path/filename:line-number:column-number: warning(tool-name): message</code></pre>

<p><p>This is often called the ""Emacs format,"" but even if you aren't using Emacs, it's a reasonable format for homogenizing reports. For example:</p>

<pre><code>/project/src/com/example/Foo.java:425:9: warning(Checkstyle):Missing a Javadoc comment.</code></pre>

<p><p>My warning format transformations are done by my Ant script with Ant <a href=""http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/filterchain.html"">filterchains</a>.</p>

<p><p>The second ""integration"" that I do is for warning suppression. By default, each tool supports comments or an annotation (or both) that you can place in your code to silence a warning that you want to ignore. But these various warning suppression requests do not have a consistent look which seems somewhat silly. When you're suppressing a warning, you're suppressing a warning, so why not always write ""<code>SuppressWarning</code>?""</p>

<p><p>For example, PMD's default configuration suppresses warning generation on lines of code with the string ""<code>NOPMD</code>"" in a comment. Also, PMD supports Java's <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation. I configure PMD to use comments containing ""<code>SuppressWarning(PMD.</code>"" instead of <code>NOPMD</code> so that PMD suppressions look alike. I fill in the particular rule that is violated when using the comment style suppression:</p>

<pre><code>// SuppressWarnings(PMD.PreserveStackTrace) justification: (false positive) exceptions are chained</code></pre>

<p><p>Only the ""<code>SuppressWarnings(PMD.</code>"" part is significant for a comment, but it is consistent with PMD's support for the <code>@SuppressWarning</code> annotation which does recognize individual rule violations by name:</p>

<pre><code>@SuppressWarnings(""PMD.CompareObjectsWithEquals"") // justification: identity comparision intended</code></pre>

<p><p>Similarly, Checkstyle suppresses warning generation between pairs of comments (no annotation support is provided). By default, comments to turn Checkstyle off and on contain the strings <code>CHECKSTYLE:OFF</code> and <code>CHECKSTYLE:ON</code>, respectively. Changing this configuration (with Checkstyle's ""SuppressionCommentFilter"") to use the strings ""<code>BEGIN&nbsp;SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.</code>"" and ""<code>END&nbsp;SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.</code>"" makes the controls look more like PMD:</p>

<pre>
<code>// BEGIN SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField) justification: ""Effective Java,"" 2nd ed., Bloch, Item 2</code>
<code>// END SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField)</code>
</pre>

<p><p>With Checkstyle comments, the particular check violation (<code>HiddenField</code>) <em>is</em> significant because each check has its own ""<code>BEGIN/END</code>"" comment pair.</p>

<p><p>FindBugs also supports warning generation suppression with a <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation, so no further configuration is required to achieve some level of uniformity with other tools. Unfortunately, Findbugs has to support a custom <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation because the built-in Java <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation has a <code>SOURCE</code> retention policy which is not strong enough to retain the annotation in the class file where FindBugs needs it. I fully qualify FindBugs warnings suppressions to avoid clashing with Java's <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation:</p>

<pre><code>@edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressWarnings(""UWF&#95;FIELD&#95;NOT&#95;INITIALIZED&#95;IN&#95;CONSTRUCTOR"")</code></pre>

<p><p>These techniques makes things look reasonably consistent across tools. Note that having each warning suppression contain the string ""<code>SuppressWarnings</code>"" makes it easy to run a simple search to find all instances for all tools over an entire code base.</p>

<p>Writer.java writes a string to file and then waits for the user to hit enter before writing another line to file. The idea being that it could be started up, then a reader can be started to see how it copes with the ""partial"" file. The reader I wrote is in Reader.java.</p>

<p>Loading libA before libB should work, unless one of those libraries has a dependency that is unaccounted for and not in the path. My understanding is that once it gets to a system loadLibrary call (i.e. Java has found the library in its java.library.path and is now telling the OS to load it) - it is completely dependent on the operating system to find any dependent libraries, because at that point it is the operating system that is loading the library for the process, and the OS only knows how to look in the system path. That seems hard to set in the case of a Webstart app, but there is a way around this that does not involve static compiling. You may be able to shuffle where your libraries are - I am unsure </p>

<p>If you use a custom classloader, you can override loadLibrary and findLibrary so that it can locate your libraries from within a jar in your classpath, and if you also make it aware of your native library dependencies (i.e. libB depends on libA depends on libX, then when loading libB you can catch yourself and ensure you load libA first, and in checking that notice and load libX first.

<p>Further Edit: The reason the second option would print Integer is because there is no ""widening"" into a larger primitive as an option, so it MUST box it up, thus Integer is the only option.  Furthermore, java will only autobox to the original type, so it would give a compiler error if you leave the hello(Long) and removed hello(Integer).</p>",122,,122,Mike Stone,8/7/2008 16:41,8/7/2008 16:41,,,,0,,,
5091,2,,4922,8/7/2008 18:18,9,,"<p>In the first case, you have a widening conversion happening. This can be see when runinng the ""javap"" utility program (included w/ the JDK), on the compiled class:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(java.lang.String[]);<br>  Code:<br>   0:   iconst_ 5<br>   1:   istore_ 1<br>   2:   iload_ 1<br>   3:   i2l<br>   4:   invokestatic    #6; //Method hello:(J)V<br>   7:   return<br><br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>Clearly, you see the I2L, which is the mnemonic for the widening Integer-To-Long bytecode instruction. See reference <a href=""http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jvms/second_edition/html/Instructions2.doc6.html"">here</a>.</p>

<p>And in the other case, replacing the ""long x"" with the object ""Long x"" signature, you'll have this code in the main method:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(java.lang.String[]);<br>  Code:<br>   0:   iconst_ 5<br>   1:   istore_ 1<br>   2:   iload_ 1<br>   3:   invokestatic    #6; //Method java/lang/Integer.valueOf:(I)Ljava/lang/Integer;<br>   6:   invokestatic    #7; //Method hello:(Ljava/lang/Integer;)V<br>   9:   return<br><br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>So you see the compiler has created the instruction Integer.valueOf(int), to box the primitive inside the wrapper.</p>",861,camilojd,,,,8/7/2008 18:18,,,,1,,,
5164,2,,4922,8/7/2008 19:02,1,,"<p>Another interesting thing with this example is the method overloading. The combination of type widening and method overloading only working because the compiler has to make a decision of which method to choose. Consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code>public static void hello(Collection x){
   System.out.println(""Collection"");
}

public static void hello(List x){
   System.out.println(""List"");
}

public static void main(String[] args){
   Collection col = new ArrayList();
   hello(col);
}

There are probably other reasons for this as well, as all languages usually have ways to do <em>unsafe</em> things if one knows how to deal with them.</p>

<p>Let me start with an example of failing object construction.</p>

<p>Let's define a class A, such that:</p>

<pre><code>class A {
   private String a = ""A"";

   public A() throws Exception {
        throw new Exception();
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let's assume we would like to create an object of type A in a <code>try...catch</code> block.</p>

<pre><code>A a = null;
try{
  a = new A();
}catch(Exception e) {
  //...
}
System.out.println(a);
</code></pre>

<p>Evidently, the output of this code will be: <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>Why Java does not return a partially constructed version of A? After all, by the point the constructor fails its <code>name</code> field member has already being initialized, right?</p>

<p>Java does not do that because the object was not successfully built. The object is in a inconsistent state, and it is therefore discarded by Java. Your variable A is not even initialized, it is kept as null. </p>

<p>Now, as you know, to fully build a new object, all its super classes must be initialized first. If one of the super classes failed to build, what would be the final state of the object? It is impossible to determine that.</p>

<p>Look at this more elaborate example</p>

<pre><code>class A {
   private final int a;
   public A() throws Exception { 
      a = 10;
   }
}

class B extends A {
   private final int b;
   public B() throws Exception {
       methodThatThrowsException(); 
       b = 20;
   }
}

class C extends B {
   public C() throws Exception { super(); }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When the constructor of <code>C</code> is invoked, if an exception occurs on initializing <code>B</code>, what would be the value of the final variable <code>int b</code>?</p>

<p>As such, the object C cannot be created, it is bogus, it is trash, it is not fully initialized.</p>

<p>For me, this explains why your code is illegal.</p>

6640,2,,6639,8/9/2008 5:35,33,,"<p><strong>The short answer</strong></p>

<p>Use one of these two methods:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getResource%28java.lang.String%29""><code>Class.getResource(String)</code></a></li>
<li><a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getResourceAsStream%28java.lang.String%29""><code>Class.getResourceAsStream(String)</code></a></li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>InputStream inputStream = 
                YourClass.class.getResourceAsStream(""image.jpg"");
</code></pre>

<p>--</p>

<p><strong>The long answer</strong></p>

<p>Typically, one would not want to load files using absolute paths. For example, don’t do this if you can help it:</p>

<pre><code>File file = new File(""C:\\Users\\Joe\\image.jpg"");
</code></pre>

<p>This technique is not recommended for at least two reasons. First, it creates a dependency on a particular operating system, which prevents the application from easily moving to another operating system. One of Java’s main benefits is the ability to run the same bytecode on many different platforms. Using an absolute path like this makes the code much less portable.</p>

<p>Second, depending on the relative location of the file, this technique might create an external dependency and limit the application’s mobility. If the file exists outside the application’s current directory, this creates an external dependency and one would have to be aware of the dependency in order to move the application to another machine (error prone).</p>

<p>Instead, use the <code>getResource()</code> methods in the <code>Class</code> class. This makes the application much more portable. It  can be moved to different platforms, machines, or directories and still function correctly.</p>

Junit3 works perfectly well, and the introduction of annotations in 4 doesn't buy you very much (in my opinion).  It is much more important that you guys <em>write</em> tests, and it sounds like you do.  </p>

<p>Use whatever seems most natural and helps you get your work done.</p>

<p>I can't comment on TestNG b/c I haven't used it.  But I would recommend <a href=""http://www.unitils.org/summary.html"">unitils</a>, a great wrapper for JUnit/TestNG/DBUnit/EasyMock, regardless of which route you take. (It supports all the flavors mentioned above)</p>

6671,2,,6658,8/9/2008 7:00,39,,"<p>I've used both, but I have to agree with Justin Standard that you shouldn't really consider rewriting your existing tests to any new format.  Regardless of the decision, it is pretty trivial to run both.  TestNG strives to be much more configurable than JUnit, but in the end they both work equally well.</p>

<p>TestNG has a neat feature where you can mark tests as a particular group, and then easily run all tests of a specific group, or exclude tests of a particular group.  Thus you can mark tests that run slowly as in the ""slow"" group and then ignore them when you want quick results.  A suggestion from their documentation is to mark some subset as ""checkin"" tests which should be run whenever you check new files in.  I never saw such a feature in JUnit, but then again, if you don't have it, you don't REALLY miss it.</p>

<p>For all its claims of high configuration, I did run into a corner case the a couple weeks ago where I couldn't do what I wanted to do... I wish I could remember what it is, but I wanted to bring it up so you know that it's not perfect.</p>

We didn't want people to feel uncomfortable writing tests while getting to know TestNG because we wanted them to keep writing a lot of tests.<br>
Also, JUnit is pretty much the de-facto standard in the Java world. There's no decent tool that doesn't support it from the box, you can find a lot of help on the web and they added a lot of new features in the past year which shows it's alive.</p>

<p>TestNG's other big draw cards for me include test parameters, data providers, annotation transformers, and more than anything - the vibrant and responsive user community.</p>

<p>Whilst on the surface one might not think all of TestNGs features above might not be needed, once you start to understand the flexibility bring to your tests, you'll wonder how you coped with JUnit.</p>

46727,2,,6658,9/5/2008 19:44,4,,"<p>A couple of additions to Mike Stone's reply:</p>

<p>1) The most frequent thing I use TestNG's groups for is when I want to run a single test method in a test suite.  I simply add this test to the group ""phil"" and then run this group.  When I was using JUnit 3, I would comment out the entries for all methods but the one I wanted to run in the ""suite"" method, but then would commonly forget to uncomment them before checkin.  With the groups, I no longer have this problem.</p>

<p>2) Depending on the complexity of the tests, migrating tests from JUnit3 to TestNG can be done somewhat automatically with sed and creating a base class to replace TestCase that static imports all of the TestNG assert methods.</p>

<p>I have info on my migration from JUnit to TestNG <a href=""http://www.philvarner.com/blog/2008/01/30/testng-migration/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.philvarner.com/blog/2008/02/10/testng-part-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

I found built-in Parameterized runner is quite crude in Junit4 as compare to TestNG (I know each framework has its strengths but still). The Junit4 annotation @parameters is restricted to one set of parameters. I encountered this problem while testing the valid and invalid behavior for functionality in same test class. So the first public, static annotated method that it finds will be used, but it may find them in any order. This causes us to write different classes unnecessarily. However TestNG provides clean way to provide different kind of data providers for each and every method. So we can test the same unit of code with valid and invalid way in same test class putting the valid/invalid data separately. I will go with TestNG.</p>

<p>Ok, firstly JUnit has been playing catchup with TestNG in terms of functionality, they have bridged the gap some what with v4, but not well enough in my opinion. Things like annotations and dataproviders are still much better in TestNG. Also they are more flexible in terms of test execution, since TestNG has test dependency, grouping and ordering.</p>

<p>JUnit still requires certain before/after methods to be static, which limits what you can do prior to the running of tests, TestNG never has this issue.</p>

<p>TBH, mostly the differences between the two frameworks don't mean much, unless your focusing on integration/automation testing. JUnit from my experience is built from the ground up for unit testing and is now being pushed towards higher levels of testing, which IMO makes it the wrong tool for the job. TestNG does well at unit testing and due to its robust dataproviding and great test execution abilities, works even better at integration/automation test level.</p>

<p>Now for what I believe is a separate issue, how to write well structured, readable and maintainable tests. Most of this I am sure you know, but things like <strong>Factory Pattern</strong>, <strong>Command Pattern</strong> and <strong>PageObjects</strong> (if your testing websites) are vital, it is very important to have a layer of abstraction between what your testing (SUT) and what the actual test is (assertions of business logic). In order to have much nicer assertions, you can use <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""hamcrest"">Hamcrest</a>. Make use of javas inheritance/interfaces to reduce repetition and enforce commonality.</p>

<p>Almost forgot, also use the <strong>Test Data Builder Pattern</strong>, this coupled with TestNG's dataprovider annotation is very useful.</p>

<pre><code>1.  JUnit still requires certain before/after methods to be static, which limits
     what you can do prior to the running of tests, TestNG never has this issue.

2.  TestNG @Configuration methods can all take an optional argument to their 
    annotated methods in the form of a ITestResult, XmlTest, Method, or 
    ITestContext.  This allows you to pass things around that JUnit wouldn't 
    provide you.  JUnit only does this in listeners and it is limited in use.

3.  TestNG comes with some pre-made report generation classes that you can copy
     and edit and make into your own beautiful test output with very little 
     effort. Just copy the report class into your project and add a listener 
     to run it.  

4.  TestNG has a handful of nice listeners that you can hook onto so you can do
     additional magic at certain phases during testing.

One thing you can do is to create a thread-local global variable where you write the ID of the current context. (This can be done with AOP.) Then in the singleton getter, the context ID is fetched from the thread-local to use as a key to the correct ""singleton"" instance for the calling context. </p>

<p>Regarding AOP there should be no problem using it in applets since, depending on your point-cuts, the advices are woven at compile time and a JAR is added to the runtime dependencies. Hence, no special evidence of AOP should remain at run time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks for you answer. It makes sense. Can you please explain me MathContext in the context of BigDecimal#round method.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's nothing special about <code>BigDecimal.round()</code> <em>vs.</em> any other <code>BigDecimal</code> method.  In all cases, the <code>MathContext</code> specifies the number of significant digits and the rounding technique.  Basically, there are two parts of every <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/math/MathContext.html""><code>MathContext</code></a>.  There's a precision, and there's also a <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/math/RoundingMode.html""><code>RoundingMode</code></a>.</p>

<p>The precision again specifies the number of significant digits.  So if you specify <code>123</code> as a number, and ask for 2 significant digits, you're going to get <code>120</code>.  It might be clearer if you think in terms of scientific notation.</p>

<p><code>123</code> would be <code>1.23e2</code> in scientific notation.  If you only keep 2 significant digits, then you get <code>1.2e2</code>, or <code>120</code>.  By reducing the number of significant digits, we reduce the precision with which we can specify a number.</p>

<p>The <code>RoundingMode</code> part specifies how we should handle the loss of precision.  To reuse the example, if you use <code>123</code> as the number, and ask for 2 significant digits, you've reduced your precision.  With a <code>RoundingMode</code> of <code>HALF_UP</code> (the default mode), <code>123</code> will become <code>120</code>.  With a <code>RoundingMode</code> of <code>CEILING</code>, you'll get <code>130</code>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println(new BigDecimal(""123.4"",
                   new MathContext(4,RoundingMode.HALF_UP)));
System.out.println(new BigDecimal(""123.4"",
                   new MathContext(2,RoundingMode.HALF_UP)));
System.out.println(new BigDecimal(""123.4"",
                   new MathContext(2,RoundingMode.CEILING)));
System.out.println(new BigDecimal(""123.4"",
                   new MathContext(1,RoundingMode.CEILING)));
</code></pre>

<p>Outputs:</p>

<pre><code>123.4
1.2E+2
1.3E+2
2E+2
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that both the precision and the rounding mode affect the output.</p>

<pre><code>BigDecimal d2 = new BigDecimal(0.000000454770054, MATH_CTX);
System.out.println(d2);

<p>your number <strong>will not be rounded to 3 places after comma</strong> - for someone it can be not intuitive and worth to emphasize. Instead it will be rounded to the <strong>first 3 significant digits</strong>, which in this case are ""4 5 4"". So above code results in <code>4.55E-7</code> and not in <code>0.000</code> as someone could expect.</p>

<p>Similar examples:</p>

<pre><code>BigDecimal d3 = new BigDecimal(0.001000045477, MATH_CTX);
 System.out.println(d3);  // 0.00100

BigDecimal d4 = new BigDecimal(0.200000477, MATH_CTX);

BigDecimal d5 = new BigDecimal(0.000000004, MATH_CTX);
    System.out.println(d5); //4.00E-9

Some shops make a separate Constants class but I don't see the value in lumping unrelated numbers and strings into a single class.

43779,2,,7596,9/4/2008 13:40,1,,"<p>Short answer: draw your system architecture in terms of modules, drawn side-by-side, with each module sliced vertically into layers (e.g. view, model, persistence). Then use a structure like <em>com.mycompany.myapp.somemodule.somelayer</em>, e.g. <em>com.mycompany.myapp.client.view</em> or <em>com.mycompany.myapp.server.model</em>.</p>

<p>Using the top level of packages for application <em>modules</em>, in the old-fashioned computer-science sense of modular programming, ought to be obvious. However, on most of the projects I have worked on we end up forgetting to do that, and end up with a mess of packages without that top-level structure. This anti-pattern usually shows itself as a package for something like 'listeners' or 'actions' that groups otherwise unrelated classes simply because they happen to implement the same interface.</p>

<p>Within a module, or in a small application, use packages for the application layers. Likely packages include things like the following, depending on the architecture:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.view</em></li>
<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.model</em></li>
<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.services</em></li>
<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.rules</em></li>
<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.persistence</em> (or 'dao' for data access layer)</li>
<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.util</em> (beware of this being used as if it were 'misc')</li>
</ul>

<p>Within each of these layers, it is natural to group classes by type if there are a lot. A common anti-pattern here is to unnecessarily introduce too many packages and levels of sub-package so that there are only a few classes in each package.</p>

66745,2,,7596,9/15/2008 20:43,5,,"<p>Where I'm working, we're using Maven 2 and we have a pretty nice archetype for our projects. The goal was to obtain a good separation of concerns, thus we defined a project structure using multiple modules (one for each application 'layer'):
  - common: common code used by the other layers (e.g., i18n)
  - entities: the domain entities
  - repositories: this module contains the daos interfaces and implementations
  - services-intf: interfaces for the services (e.g, UserService, ...) 
  - services-impl: implementations of the services (e.g, UserServiceImpl) 
  - web: everything regarding the web content (e.g., css, jsps, jsf pages, ...)
  - ws: web services</p>

<p>Each module has its own dependencies (e.g., repositories could have jpa) and some are project wide (thus they belong in the common module). Dependencies between the different project modules clearly separate things (e.g., the web layer depends on the service layer but doesn't know about the repository layer).</p>

<p>Each module has its own base package, for example if the application package is ""com.foo.bar"", then we have:</p>

<pre><code>com.foo.bar.common
com.foo.bar.entities
com.foo.bar.repositories
com.foo.bar.services
com.foo.bar.services.impl
...
</code></pre>

<p>Each module respects the standard maven project structure:</p>

<pre><code>   src\
   ..main\java
     ...\resources
   ..test\java
     ...\resources
</code></pre>

<p>Unit tests for a given layer easily find their place under \src\test... Everything that is domain specific has it's place in the entities module. Now something like a FileStorageStrategy should go into the repositories module, since we don't need to know exactly what the implementation is. In the services layer, we only know the repository interface, we do not care what the specific implementation is (separation of concerns).</p>

<p>There are multiple advantages to this approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>clear separation of concerns</li>
<li>each module is packageable as a jar (or a war in the case of the web module) and thus allows for easier code reuse (e.g., we could install the module in the maven repository and reuse it in another project)</li>
<li>maximum independence of each part of the project</li>

149971,2,,7720,9/29/2008 18:16,21,,"<p>To follow up on pauxu's answer, I'm using launch4j and NSIS on a project of mine and thought it would be helpful to show just how I'm using them.  Here's what I'm doing for Windows.  BTW, I'm creating .app and .dmg for Mac, but haven't figured out what to do for Linux yet.</p>

<h2>Project Copies of launch4j and NSIS</h2>

<p>In my project I have a ""vendor"" directory and underneath it I have a directory for ""launch4j"" and ""nsis"".  Within each is a copy of the install for each application.  I find it easier to have a copy local to the project rather than forcing others to install both products and set up some kind of environment variable to point to each.</p>

<h2>Script Files</h2>

<p>I also have a ""scripts"" directory in my project that holds various configuration/script files for my project.  First there is the launch4j.xml file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;launch4jConfig&gt;
  &lt;dontWrapJar&gt;true&lt;/dontWrapJar&gt;
  &lt;headerType&gt;gui&lt;/headerType&gt;
  &lt;jar&gt;rpgam.jar&lt;/jar&gt;
  &lt;outfile&gt;rpgam.exe&lt;/outfile&gt;
  &lt;errTitle&gt;&lt;/errTitle&gt;
  &lt;cmdLine&gt;&lt;/cmdLine&gt;
  &lt;chdir&gt;.&lt;/chdir&gt;
  &lt;priority&gt;normal&lt;/priority&gt;
  &lt;downloadUrl&gt;http://www.rpgaudiomixer.com/&lt;/downloadUrl&gt;
  &lt;supportUrl&gt;&lt;/supportUrl&gt;
  &lt;customProcName&gt;false&lt;/customProcName&gt;
  &lt;stayAlive&gt;false&lt;/stayAlive&gt;
  &lt;manifest&gt;&lt;/manifest&gt;
  &lt;icon&gt;&lt;/icon&gt;
  &lt;jre&gt;
    &lt;path&gt;&lt;/path&gt;
    &lt;minVersion&gt;1.5.0&lt;/minVersion&gt;
    &lt;maxVersion&gt;&lt;/maxVersion&gt;
    &lt;jdkPreference&gt;preferJre&lt;/jdkPreference&gt;
  &lt;/jre&gt;
  &lt;splash&gt;
    &lt;file&gt;..\images\splash.bmp&lt;/file&gt;
    &lt;waitForWindow&gt;true&lt;/waitForWindow&gt;
    &lt;timeout&gt;60&lt;/timeout&gt;
    &lt;timeoutErr&gt;true&lt;/timeoutErr&gt;
  &lt;/splash&gt;
&lt;/launch4jConfig&gt;
</code></pre>

</code></pre>

<h2>Ant Integration</h2>

<p>I have some targets in my Ant buildfile (build.xml) to handle the above.  First I tel Ant to import launch4j's Ant tasks:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;property name=""launch4j.dir"" location=""vendor/launch4j"" /&gt;
&lt;taskdef name=""launch4j"" 
    classname=""net.sf.launch4j.ant.Launch4jTask""
    classpath=""${launch4j.dir}/launch4j.jar:${launch4j.dir}/lib/xstream.jar"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I then have a simple target for creating the wrapper executable:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;target name=""executable-windows"" depends=""jar"" description=""Create Windows executable (EXE)""&gt;
    &lt;launch4j configFile=""scripts/launch4j.xml"" outfile=""${exeFile}"" /&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And another target for making the installer:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;target name=""installer-windows"" depends=""executable-windows"" description=""Create the installer for Windows (EXE)""&gt;
    &lt;!-- Lay out files needed for building the installer --&gt;
    &lt;mkdir dir=""${windowsLayoutDirectory}"" /&gt;
    &lt;copy file=""${jarFile}"" todir=""${windowsLayoutDirectory}"" /&gt;
    &lt;copy todir=""${windowsLayoutDirectory}/lib""&gt;
        &lt;fileset dir=""${libraryDirectory}"" /&gt;
        &lt;fileset dir=""${windowsLibraryDirectory}"" /&gt;
    &lt;/copy&gt;
    &lt;copy todir=""${windowsLayoutDirectory}/icons""&gt;
         &lt;fileset dir=""${iconsDirectory}"" /&gt;
    &lt;/copy&gt;
    &lt;copy todir=""${windowsLayoutDirectory}"" file=""${exeFile}"" /&gt;

    &lt;mkdir dir=""${windowsInstallerDirectory}"" /&gt;

    &lt;!-- Build the installer using NSIS --&gt;
    &lt;exec executable=""vendor/nsis/makensis.exe""&gt;
        &lt;arg value=""/DVERSION=${version}"" /&gt;
        &lt;arg value=""scripts/rpgam-setup.nsi"" /&gt;
    &lt;/exec&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The top portion of that just copies the necessary files for the installer to a temporary location and the second half executes the script that uses all of it to make the installer.</p>

The Tomcat instance that runs in JBoss is configured with emptySessionPath=""true"", rather than ""false"", which is the default.

13367,2,,8569,8/16/2008 21:12,17,,"<p>Small tip - I've found it helpful to modularize and clearly label my Spring xml context files based on application concern. Here's an example for a web app I worked on:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>MyProject / src / main / resources / spring /</code>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>datasource.xml</strong></em>  -  My single data source bean.</li>
<li><em><strong>persistence.xml</strong></em>  -  My DAOs/Repositories. Depends on <code>datasource.xml</code> beans.</li>
<li><em><strong>services.xml</strong></em>  -  Service layer implementations. These are usually the beans to which I apply transactionality using AOP. Depends on <code>persistence.xml</code> beans.</li>
<li><em><strong>controllers.xml</strong></em>  - My Spring MVC controllers. Depends on <code>services.xml</code> beans.</li>
<li><em><strong>views.xml</strong></em> - My view implementations.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This list is neither perfect nor exhaustive, but I hope it illustrates the point. Choose whatever naming strategy and granularity works best for you.</p>

<p>In my (limited) experience, I've seen this approach yeild the following benefits:</p>

<p><strong>Clearer architecture</strong></p>

<p>Clearly named context files gives those unfamiliar with your project structure a reasonable 
place to start looking for bean definitions. Can make detecting circular/unwanted dependencies a little easier.</p>

<p><strong>Helps domain design</strong></p>

<p>If you want to add a bean definition, but it doesn't fit well in any of your context files, perhaps there's a new concept or concern emerging? Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Suppose you want to make your Service layer transactional with AOP. Do you add those bean definitions to <code>services.xml</code>, or put them in their own <code>transactionPolicy.xml</code>? Talk it over with your team. Should your transaction policy be pluggable?</li>
<li>Add Acegi/Spring Security beans to your <code>controllers.xml</code> file, or create a <code>security.xml</code> context file? Do you have different security requirements for different deployments/environments?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Integration testing</strong></p>

<p>You can wire up a subset of your application for integration testing (ex: given the above files, to test the database you need to create only <code>datasource.xml</code> and <code>persistence.xml</code> beans).</p>

<p>Specifically, you can annotate an integration test class as such:</p>

<pre><code>@ContextConfiguration(locations = { ""/spring/datasource.xml"" , ""/spring/persistence.xml"" })
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Works well with Spring IDE's Beans Graph</strong></p>

<p>Having lots of focused and well-named context files makes it easy to create custom BeansConfigSets to visualize the layers of your app using Spring IDE's <a href=""http://springide.org/project/wiki/BeansGraph"">Beans Graph</a>. I've used this before to give new team members a high-level overview of our application's organization.</p>

<p>Spring MVC and JDBC template would be my starting recommendations.  You can go a very long way just with those.</p>

<p>My recommendation would be to follow the Spring architectural recommendations faithfully.  Use their layering ideas.  Make sure that your web layer is completely detachable from the rest.  You do this by letting the web tier interact with the back end only through the service layer.</p>

<p>If you want to reuse that service layer, a good recommendation is to expose it using Spring ""contract first"" web services.  If you start with the XML messages that you pass back and forth, your client and server can be completely decoupled.</p>

<p>The IDE with the best Spring support is IntelliJ.  It's worth spending a few bucks.</p>

275353,2,,9044,11/8/2008 23:12,1,,"<p>The answer is through a custom <strong>org.testng.IMethodSelector</strong>:</p>

<p>Its <strong>includeMethod()</strong> can exclude any method we want, like a public not-annotated method.</p>

<p>However, to register a custom <em>Java</em> MethodSelector, you must add it to the <strong>XMLTest</strong> instance managed by any TestRunner, which means you need your own <strong>custom TestRunner</strong>.</p>

<p>But, to build a custom TestRunner, you need to register a <strong>TestRunnerFactory</strong>, through the <strong>-testrunfactory</strong> option.</p>

<p>BUT that -testrunfactory is NEVER taken into account by <strong>TestNG</strong> class... so you need also to define a custom TestNG class :</p>

<ul>
<li>in order to override the configure(Map) method, </li>
<li>so you can actually set the TestRunnerFactory</li>
<li>TestRunnerFactory which will build you a custom TestRunner,</li>
<li>TestRunner which will set to the XMLTest instance a custom XMLMethodSelector</li>
<li>XMLMethodSelector which will build a custom IMethodSelector</li>
<li>IMethodSelector which will exclude any TestNG methods of your choosing!</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok... it's a nightmare. But it is also a code-challenge, so it must be a little challenging ;)</p>

<p>All the code is available at <a href=""http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/6446"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>DZone snippets</strong></a>.</p>

<p>As usual for a code challenge:</p>

<ul>
<li>one java class (and quite a few inner classes)</li>
<li>copy-paste the class in a 'source/test' directory (since the package is 'test')</li>
<li>run it (no arguments needed)</li>

<p><strong>Update from Mike Stone:</strong></p>

<p>I'm going to accept this because it sounds pretty close to what I ended up doing, but I figured I would add what I did as well.</p>

<p>Basically, I created a Groups annotation that behaves like the groups property of the Test (and other) annotations.</p>

<p>Then, I created a GroupsAnnotationTransformer, which uses IAnnotationTransformer to look at all tests and test classes being defined, then modifies the test to add the groups, which works perfectly with group exclusion and inclusion.</p>

<p>Modify the build to use the new annotation transformer, and it all works perfectly!</p>

<p>Well... the one caveat is that it doesn't add the groups to non-test methods... because at the time I did this, there was another annotation transformer that lets you transform ANYTHING, but it somehow wasn't included in the TestNG I was using for some reason... so it is a good idea to make your before/after annotated methods to alwaysRun=true... which is sufficient for me.</p>

<p>The end result is I can do:</p>

<pre><code>@Groups({ ""myGroup1"", ""myGroup2""})
public class MyTestCase {
    @Test
    @Groups(""aMethodLevelGroup"")
    public void myTest() {
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I made the transformer work with subclassing and everything.</p>

9970,2,,9913,8/13/2008 15:45,7,,"<p>I have a couple of issues with some of the solutions offered so far. None of the file operations use anything other than the system default character encoding. As every good developer knows, <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html"" rel=""nofollow"">there's no such thing as plain text</a>.</p>

<p>Here is how to get the platform encoding to see what you're using:</p>

<pre><code>public static String getDefaultFileEncoding() {
    final String keyEncoding = ""file.encoding"";
    final String encoding = System
            .getProperty(keyEncoding);
    if (encoding == null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException(
                keyEncoding
                        + ""=null"");
    }
    return encoding;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, use the <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/nio/charset/Charset.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Charset</a> class for a strongly typed value (alas, not every API in Java 6 has been updated to support Charset, so sometimes you need to fall back on a String). <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/intl/encoding.doc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">List of supported encodings.</a></p>

<p>The <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/Reader.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Reader</a>/<a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/Writer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Writer</a> implementations handle the character conversion. For example:</p>

<pre><code>//&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
InputStream in = new FileInputStream(""myfile.xml"");
/*Reader reader = new InputStreamReader(in); ///WRONG!!!!!!*/
Reader reader = new InputStreamReader(in, ""UTF-8""); //RIGHT
</code></pre>

<p>File streams are being handled in a way that may lead to resource leaks. Streams should be closed in a finally block. This ensures that they are closed even if there is an I/O error. Note that the stream initialization is before the try block.</p>

<pre><code>OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(""file.txt"");
try {
    //write to stream
} finally {
    out.close();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is an example of how to read a file into a String:</p>

<pre><code>  /** Copies characters from reader to writer */
  public static void copy(Reader reader, Writer writer)
      throws IOException {
    final int bufferSize = 1024; // arbitrary value
    char[] buffer = new char[bufferSize];
    while (true) {
      int r = reader.read(buffer);
      if (r &lt; 0) {
        break;
      }
      writer.write(buffer, 0, r);
    }
  }

  /** Copies contents of File to String. Decodes from given encoding. */
  public static String readToString(File file,
      Charset encoding) throws IOException {
    Writer writer = new StringWriter();
    InputStream in = new FileInputStream(file);
    Closeable resource = in;
    try {
      Reader reader = new InputStreamReader(in, encoding);
      resource = reader;
      copy(reader, writer);
    } finally {
      resource.close();
    }
    return writer.toString();
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Sample usage:</p>

<pre><code>  public static void main(String[] args) {
    File file = new File(""foo.xml"");
    Charset utf8 = Charset.forName(""UTF8"");
    try {
      String s = readToString(file, utf8);
      System.out.println(s);
    } catch (IOException e) {

Even though they are signed they have plenty of spare bits (32 total) to treat as an unsigned byte. Also, all of the mathematical operators will convert smaller fixed precision numbers to <strong>int</strong>. Example:</p>

<pre><code>short a = 1s;
short b = 2s;
int c = a + b; // the result is up-converted
short small = (short)c; // must cast to get it back to short

<p>A WSDL document defines services as collections of network endpoints, or ports. In WSDL, the abstract definition of endpoints and messages is separated from their concrete network deployment or data format bindings. This allows the reuse of abstract definitions: messages, which are abstract descriptions of the data being exchanged, and port types which are abstract collections of operations. The concrete protocol and data format specifications for a particular port type constitutes a reusable binding. A port is defined by associating a network address with a reusable binding, and a collection of ports define a service. Hence, a WSDL document uses the following elements in the definition of network services:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Types</strong>– a container for data type definitions using some type system (such as XSD).</li>
<li><strong>Message</strong>– an abstract, typed definition of the data being communicated.</li>
<li><strong>Operation</strong>– an abstract description of an action supported by the service.</li>
<li><strong>Port Type</strong>–an abstract set of operations supported by one or more endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Binding</strong>– a concrete protocol and data format specification for a particular port type.</li>
<li><strong>Port</strong>– a single endpoint defined as a combination of a binding and a network address.</li>
<li><strong>Service</strong>– a collection of related endpoints.</li>

I am <em>guessing</em> that .NET contacts some web site which reports it back.  There are a couple ways to go.  First, a deeper look into the ICMP protocol may give you the information you need.  You can also trace the IP you go through (your route).  When you encounter an IP that is not in the following ranges:</p>

<ul>
<li>10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255</li>

It also seems to me that the combination of XML and XPath hits a sweet spot for data formats that need to be extensible; that is to say, it’s pretty easy to write XML-processing code that won’t fail in the presence of changes to the message format that don’t touch the piece you care about.""</em></p>

<p>But application config isn't always just key/value pairs.  Look at something like the tomcat configuration for what ports it listens on.  Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;Connector port=""80"" maxHttpHeaderSize=""8192""
           maxThreads=""150"" minSpareThreads=""25"" maxSpareThreads=""75""
           enableLookups=""false"" redirectPort=""8443"" acceptCount=""100""

    &lt;Connector port=""8009"" 
           enableLookups=""false"" redirectPort=""8443"" protocol=""AJP/1.3"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can have any number of connectors.  Define more in the file and more connectors exist.  Don't define any more and no more exist.  There's no good way (imho) to do that with plain old key/value pairs.</p>

<p>If your app's config is simple, then something simple like an INI file that's read into a dictionary is probably fine.  But for something more complex like server configuration, an INI file would be a huge pain to maintain, and something more structural like XML or YAML would be better.  It all depends on the problem set.</p>

SQLite implements a very robust data storage engine that is extremely difficult to corrupt when you have power outages or programs that are hung in an inconsistent state due to errors.

The build a data structure that you populate with said objects and access the objects through the data structure's given accessors.</p>

<p>Something like:</p>

<pre><code>class Schedule
{

Wing is quite right that these should probably be <strong><em>constants</em></strong> (or maybe enums).</p>

<p>What Bruce needs, at it's heart, is simply a lookup table.  He doesn't need a hierarchy of objects and interfaces; he needs a way to look up a schedule based on a season and a group identifier.  Turning things into objects only makes sense if they have responsibilities or state.  If they have neither, then they are simply identifiers, and building special objects for them just makes the codebase larger.</p>

<p>You <em>could</em> build, e.g., <code>Group</code> objects that each contain a set of schedule strings (one for each season), but if all the <code>Group</code> object does is provide lookup functionality, then you've reinvented the lookup table in a much less intuitive fashion.  If he has to look up the group, and then lookup the schedule, all he has is a two-step lookup table that took longer to code, is more likely to be buggy, and will be harder to maintain.</p>

<p>Embedding a DB in Java doesn't make it easier to maintain.  There's now an additional code dependency that did not previously exist.  Updating the set of schedules is now more difficult, as either a custom tool must be coded or a DB-specific interface must be used, whereas previous notepad.exe was sufficient.  Scalability is not a concern here, either.  The needs of this system could increase by a million and the flat file would still work just fine.</p>

<p>Certainly, it's possible that in the future needs will evolve to the point that it's worth moving to a database.  That's when you make the change.  Trying to future-proof an application never works, because we <em>always</em> assume incorrectly about future needs.  We can't say it'll only take a few hours to embed the database either, because we suck at estimating schedules, too.  If there even comes a time when the database is appropriate, <em>then</em> refactor the code to use a database.

<blockquote>
  <p>Some of the features in this taglib

<p>You could probably do this with the <strong><a href=""http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt</a></strong> taglib.</p>

<pre class=""lang-jsp prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;fmt:bundle basename=""messages""&gt;

        &lt;fmt:param value=""&lt;/a&gt;"" /&gt;
    &lt;/fmt:message&gt;
&lt;/fmt:bundle&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The downside is that this isn't valid XML and yanking the values to variables involves more indirection, lookups and verbosity. This is not a good solution.</p>

<p>I don't know Struts, but if it is anything like JavaServer Faces (same architect), then there is probably support for configuring a replacement control. I would either replace the existing control with a more flexible one or add a new one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anytime I receive newly-translated
  text, I must decide what to surround
  with the <code>&lt;a&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;</code> markup.</p>

<p>There is no way you should be doing this and I see this as a fault in your translation process (I am an ex-localization engineer and ex-developer of localization tools). The <code>{0}</code> characters should be included in the files that are sent to the translators. The localization guidelines should explain the string's context and the meaning of any variables.</p>

<p>You can programmatically validate the property bundles on return. String-specific regex's might do the trick. It isn't outside the realms of possibility that ""address"" and ""contact information"" would swap order during translation.</p>

<p>The simplest solution is to redesign the messages to render:</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;a href=""/address.do""&gt;Please update your address.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=""/contact.do""&gt;Please update your contact information.&lt;/a&gt;

<p>Generally, it will lead to fewer problems. Sometimes you have to compromise your UI design to accommodate localization; sometimes you need to compromise your localization process to accommodate the UI.</p>

<p>Any time a developer manually manipulates post-translation strings is a source of potentially expensive bugs. Cutting/pasting or string editing can result in character corruption, misplaced strings, etc. A translation defect needs the participation of outside parties to fix which involves cost and takes time.</p>

<p>Thinking on it, something like this might be less ugly:</p>

It actually fits even better here since we do heavy OSGi development and have lots of bundles. I must echo Anders Sandvig comments: keep trunk/tags/branches on the root level since you will only branch a limited set of modules. It also does not interfere with modules building individually.</p>

610268,2,,14397,3/4/2009 12:04,2,,"<p>Just my two cents...</p>

<p>I just want to emphasize the comment in the SVN documentation (already quoted in another answer, same thread) <a href=""http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.reposadmin.planning.html#svn.reposadmin.projects.chooselayout"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.reposadmin.planning.html#svn.reposadmin.projects.chooselayout</a></p>

<p>The excerpt references the following structure :
/
   trunk/
      calc/
      calendar/
      spreadsheet/
      …
   tags/
      calc/
      calendar/
      spreadsheet/
      …
   branches/
      calc/
      calendar/
      spreadsheet/</p>

<p>""There's nothing particularly incorrect about such a layout, but it may or may not seem as intuitive for your users. Especially in large, multi-project situations with many users, those users may tend to be familiar with only one or two of the projects in the repository. But the projects-as-branch-siblings tends to de-emphasize project individuality and focus on the entire set of projects as a single entity. That's a social issue though. We like our originally suggested arrangement for purely practical reasons—it's easier to ask about (or modify, or migrate elsewhere) the entire history of a single project when there's a single repository path that holds the entire history—past, present, tagged, and branched—for that project and that project alone.""</p>

<p>For my own, I tend to agree quite strongly with this and prefer the following layout:
/
   utils/
      calc/
         trunk/
         tags/
         branches/
      calendar/
         trunk/
         tags/
         branches/
      …
   office/
      spreadsheet/
         trunk/
         tags/
         branches/</p>

<p>The reason are simply that its impractical to tag a complete project set when one would want to tag only a specific subset.</p>

<p>Let's use an example: If project-1 depends on moduleA v1.1 and moduleB v2.3, I don't want newer moduleA v2.x to appear in the tags. In fact, when coming back some days/weeks/months later to this tagged release, I would be forced to open the bundle descriptor in the tagged version of project-1 to read the version of moduleA actually required.</p>

<p>Moreover, if I have to make a specific backup of this release's sources onto a CD, I just want to export this tag without downloading hundreds of megabytes of unrelated stuff.</p>

<p>It was just my two cents.</p>

<p>Sure it's a little prettier, but it's still passing around a superfluous boolean. And if the inner loop modified local variables, refactoring it into a method isn't always the correct solution.</p>

574522,2,,15496,2/22/2009 7:22,5,,"<p>Intersection types allow you to (kinda sorta) do enums that have an inheritance hierarchy. You can't inherit implementation, but you can delegate it to a helper class.</p>

enum Foo2 implements Bar {}

class HelperClass {
   static &lt;T extends Enum&lt;T&gt; &amp; Bar&gt; void fooBar(T the enum) {}

<p>This is useful when you have a number of different enums that implement some sort of pattern. For instance, a number of pairs of enums that have a parent-child relationship.</p>

<p>You can write generic methods that say ""Ok, given an enum value thats a parent of some other enum values, what percentage of all the possible child enums of the child type have this particular parent value as their parent?"", and have it all typesafe and done without casting. (eg: that ""Sea"" is 33% of all possible vehicles, and ""Green"" 20% of all possible Pastels).</p>

<p>The code look like this. It's pretty nasty, but there are ways to make it better.

<p>It requires more bytecodes to reference a class-scope variable than a method-scope variable. The addition of a method call prior to the critical loop adds little overhead (and the call might be inlined by the compiler anyway).</p>

<p>Another advantage to this technique (always using accessors) is that it eliminates a potential bug in the <strong>Slow</strong> class. If a second thread were to continually reset the value of <strong>i</strong> to 0 (by calling <code>slow.setI( 0 )</code>, for example), the <strong>Slow</strong> class could never end its loop. Calling the accessor and using a local variable eliminates that possibility.</p>

<p>Another, arguably better and less ugly approach though is to use AtomicReference (or AtomicBoolean/AtomicInteger/…) class from java.util.concurrent.atomic package.</p>

<p>One of the benefits in doing so is that these classes also provide such methods as <code>compareAndSet</code>, which may be useful if you're creating several threads which can modify the same variable.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another useful related pattern:</p>

<pre><code>final AtomicBoolean dataMsgReceived = new AtomicBoolean(false);
final AtomicReference&lt;Message&gt; message = new AtomicReference&lt;Message&gt;();
withMessageHandler(new MessageHandler() {
    public void handleMessage(Message msg) {
         if (msg.isData()) {
             synchronized (dataMsgReceived) {
                 message.set(msg);
                 dataMsgReceived.set(true);
                 dataMsgReceived.notifyAll();
             }
         }
    }
}, new Interruptible() {
    public void run() throws InterruptedException {
        synchronized (dataMsgReceived) {
            while (!dataMsgReceived.get()) {
                dataMsgReceived.wait();
            }
        }
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>In this particular example we could have simply waited on message for it to become non-null, however null may often be a valid value and then you need to use a separate flag to finish the wait.</p>

<p><code>waitMessageHandler(…)</code> above is yet another useful pattern: it sets up a handler somewhere, then starts executing the <em>Interruptible</em> which may throw an exception, and then removes the handler in the finally block, like so:</p>

<pre><code>private final AtomicReference&lt;MessageHandler&gt; messageHandler = new AtomicReference&lt;MessageHandler&gt;();
public void withMessageHandler(MessageHandler handler, Interruptible logic) throws InterruptedException {
    synchronized (messageHandler) {
        try {
            messageHandler.set(handler);
            logic.run();
        } finally {
            messageHandler.set(null);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here I assume that the <strong>messageHandler</strong>'s (if it's not null) <code>handleMessage(…)</code> method is called by another thread when a message is received. <strong>messageHandler</strong> must not be simply of <em>MessageHandler</em> type: that way you will synchronize on a changing variable, which is clearly a bug.</p>

<p>Of course, it doesn't need to be <em>InterruptedException</em>, it could be something like <em>IOException</em>, or whatever makes sense in a particular piece of code.</p>

<p>Generics in Java are simply syntax sugar. When you compile, the generic information is stripped out, and the compiler automaticly boxes/unboxes the values. This means you don't get the speed advantage of avoiding casts with strong typed generics (ala C#), and you also cannot use reflection to introspect the generic type, because it is gone.</p></li>

<li><p>Java does not have anonymous methods, or a function pointer equivalent (ie, delegates).</p>

<p>While Java does have anonymous inner classes, I find anonymous methods more useful (and much more lightweight) in my day to day use. This is also why wiring up a GUI in Java is so painful.</p></li>
<li><p>WTF is wrong with Java's Date/Time Handling? </p>

<p>I don't need to go to into detail on this one. Sun screwed up big time here, a minor list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Java DateTime Objects are mutable (wtf? you can't pass a date to a method and trust it not to be modified, or depend on a Java Date as a hashkey.)</li>
<li>Java has no concept of ""TimeSpan""</li>
<li>Java DateTime is an object, not a struct, so it must be allocated on the heap.</li>
<li>Java's lack of operator overloading means you cannot compare two DateTimes with comparison operators (&lt;=, =>, ==, != etc).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Getters and Setters as methods. This is a personal preference, but I much prefer this:</p>

<p>DateTime currentTime = DateTime.Now;</p></li>

<li><p>Doing the simple easy thing is cluttered up with implementation details of what you'd need when you're doing the complex, carefully optimized thing</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To elaborate:</p>

<p>The Kingdom of Nouns syndrome is another way of saying that Java doesn't want you to create functions as objects.  It's possible, but it goes violently against the design principles of just about every library and framework you'll see.  Time and time again I find myself settling on code duplication or inelegant hacks because Java doesn't like functions as objects.  If Java gets <a href=""http://www.javac.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">closures</a> I will be a happy person indeed.</p>

<p>As for the second, I'll simply pose a question: Can you write a Java program to read in a file line by line and do something with each line?   Off the top of your head?  Without referring to documentation or other code?  Without your IDE?  And have it compile and run on your first try?  If you can, you're a far better BufferedInputPerson than I am.</p>

<p>This isn't so much a problem with the language as it is the standard library.  Well, ignoring the exception debate.  You did remember to handle exceptions, didn't you?  </p>

<p>I mean, in theory, it could be as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>for(String line : new FileLineReader(filename))
    doSomething(line);
</code></pre>

<p>...but that isn't really in the Java style.  I mean, I love the power of the Java library, but it  seems like not much effort is made to make the easy things easy.</p>

<p>* Two technical problems that is.  There are still some people around with a sour taste in their mouths from back when java was slow, garbage collection paused execution, and tool support hadn't made Java habitable yet</p>

<p>That said, Java does have many real drawbacks and annoyances (as does any language). Most of them have been outlined above. I particularly second Patrick's comment on checked exceptions. Here is my favorite example of that:</p>

<pre><code>try {
    ...
    writer = new FileWriter(pathToFile);
    writer.write(""Some stuff"");
    writer.flush();
} catch(IOException e) {
    // OK, so an IO error could occur, log it and deal with if possible
} finally {
    // We want to close the stream regardless of if an exception occurred.
    try {
         writer.close(); // But close() throws a checked exception!
    } catch (IOException e) {
         // It does not make any sense to throw this exception, so we have to catch it
    }
}

We try to do domain model designs first <em>and then</em> base the database schema on those.</p>

<p>And then there's the infrastructure design: the team should settle on conventions on how to structure the program first and foremost. And then we work together to agree first on a design for the common functionality of the system (e.g., things everyone needs like persistence, logging, etc.). This becomes the framework of the system.</p>

<p>We all work on that together first before we split the rest of the functionalities amongst ourselves.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First read the spec like a story (skimming through it). Don't stop at every requirement to analyze it right there and then. This will allow you to get an overall picture of the system without too many details. At this point you would start identifying the major functional components of the system. Start putting these down (use a mindmap tool if you like).</p></li>
<li><p>Then take each component and start exploding it (and tying each detail with requirements in the spec document). Do this for all components, till you have covered all requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, you should start looking at relationships between the components, and whether there are repetitions of features or functions across the various components (which you can then pull out to create utility components, or such).

<li><p>NOW, you should think of designing the database, ER diagrams, Class Design, DFDs, deployment, etc.</p></li>

15956,2,,15690,8/19/2008 10:34,4,,"<p>This sounds very much like my first job. Straight out of university, I was asked to design the database and business logic layer, while other people would take care of the UI. Meanwhile the boss was looking over my shoulder, unwilling to let go of what used to be his baby and was now mine, and poking his finger in it. Three years later, developers were fleeing the company and we were still X months away from actually selling anything.</p>

<p>The big mistake was in being too ambitious. If this is your first job, you <em>will</em> make mistakes and you <em>will</em> need to change how things work long after you've written them. We had all sorts of features that made the system more complicated than it needed to be, both on the database level and in the API that it presented to other developers. In the end, the whole thing was just far too complicated to support all at once and just died.</p>

<p>So my advice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you're not sure about taking on such a big job single-handed, don't. Tell your employers, and get them to find or hire somebody for you to work with who can help you out. If people need to be added to the project, then it should be done near the start rather than after stuff starts going wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Think very carefully about what the product is for, and to boil it down to the <strong>simplest</strong> set of requirements you can think of. If the people giving you the spec aren't technical, try to see past what they've written to what will actually work and make money. Talk to customers and salespeople, and understand the market.</p></li>
<li><p>There's no shame in admitting you're wrong. If it turns out that the entire system needs to be rewritten, because you made some mistake in your first version, then it's better to admit this as soon as possible so you can get to it. Correspondingly, don't try to make an architecture that can anticipate every possible contingency in your first version, because you don't know what every contingency is and will just get it wrong. Write once with an eye to throwing away and starting again - you may not have to, the first version may be fine, but admit it if you do.</p></li>

<p>Draw it up on plain paper, thinking of where to section off the code. Remeber not to mix logic with GUI code (common error). This way you will be set to extend your applications reach in the future to servlets and/or applets or whatever platform comes along. Section in layers so that you can respond to large changes faster without rebuilding everything. Layers should not see any other layers than their closest neighbouring layers.</p>

<p>Begin with true core functionallity. All that time consuming fluff (that will make your project 4 weeks late), wont matter much to the wast majority of users. It can be added later once you are sure you can deliver on time.</p>

<p>Btw. Even though this has nothing to do with design I'd just like to say that you won't deliver on time. Make a realistic estimate on time consumption and then double it :-) I assume here that you will not be alone in this project and that people will come and go as the project progresses. You may need to train people midway through the project, people go on holiday / need surgery etc. </p>

<li>It seems that checking rows at anotherConditionAtVector is redundant since whatever the value of idx is, anotherConditionAtVector only depends on the row index (assuming anotherConditionAtVector has no side effects). </li>

<p>I believe the question was how to remove the labels, not how to optimize the algorithm. It appeared to me that the original poster was unaware of how to use 'continue' and 'break' keywords without labels, but of course, my assumptions may be wrong. </p>

<p>When it comes to performance, the post does not give any information about the implementation of the other functions, so for all I know they might as well be downloading the results via FTP as consisting of simple calculations inlined by the compiler.</p>

<p>That being said, doing the same test twice is not optimal&mdash;in theory.</p>

<p>EDIT: On a second thought, the example is actually not a horrible use of labels. I agree that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto#Criticism_of_goto_usage"" rel=""nofollow"">""goto is a no-no""</a>, but not because of code like this. The use of labels here does not actually affect the readability of the code in a significant way. Of course, they are not required and can easily be omitted, but not using them simply because ""using labels is bad"" is not a good argument in this case. After all, removing the labels does not make the code much easier to read, as others have already commented.</p>

<p>But in my case, the conditional tests are pretty simple and the algorithm is taken from a mathematical paper and therefore very likely to not change in the near future.

<p>If your xml document is available to you as an org.w3c.dom.Document object (as most parsers return), then you could do something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>// get the list of customdata nodes
NodeList customDataNodeSet = findNodes(document, ""//customdata"" );

for (int i=0 ; i &lt; customDataNodeSet.getLength() ; i++) {
  Node customDataNode = customDataNodeSet.item( i );

  // get the location nodes (if any) within this one customdata node
  NodeList locationNodeSet = findNodes(customDataNode, ""location"" );

  if (locationNodeSet.getLength() &gt; 0) {

However, I think in general leveraging OSGi in your application isn't one of those ""let's use this framework, because it's hype"" decision. It's more of a design question, but then everything that OSGi gives you in terms of design, you can have with vanilla Java as well.</p>

<p>As for the runtime, you cannot just add an existing application and make it OSGi enabled. It needs to be design to be dynamic. Spring DM makes it easy to hide that from you, but it's still there and you need to be aware of it.</p>

16817,2,,16140,8/19/2008 19:51,30,,"<p>Well, since you can not have one part OSGi and one part non-OSGi you'll need to make your entire app OSGi. In its simplest form you make a single OSGi bundle out of your entire application. Clearly this is not a best practice but it can be useful to get a feel for deploying a bundle in an OSGi container (Equinox, Felix, Knoplerfish, etc).</p>

<p>To take it to the next level you'll want to start splitting your app into components, components should typically have a set of responsibilities that can be isolated from the rest of your application through a set of interfaces and class dependencies. Identifying these purely by hand can range from rather straightforward for a well designed highly cohesive but loosely coupled application to a nightmare for interlocked source code that you are not familiar with.</p>

<p>Some help can come from tools like <a href=""http://clarkware.com/software/JDepend.html"" rel=""nofollow"">JDepend</a> which can show you the coupling of Java packages against other packages/classes in your system. A package with low efferent coupling should be easier to extract into an OSGi bundle than one with high efferent coupling. Even more architectural insight can be had with pro tools like <a href=""http://www.headwaysoftware.com/products/structure101/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">Structure 101</a>.</p>

<p>Purely on a technical level, working daily with an application that consists of 160 OSGi bundles and using Spring DM I can confirm that the transition from ""normal"" Spring to Spring DM is largely pain free. The extra namespace and the fact that you can (and should) isolate your OSGi specific Spring configuration in separate files makes it even easier to have both with and without OSGi deployment scenarios.</p>

<p>OSGi is a deep and wide component model, documentation I recommend:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.osgi.org/Release4/Download"" rel=""nofollow"">OSGi R4 Specification</a>: Get the PDFs of the Core and Compendium specification, they are canonical, authoritative and very readable. Have a shortcut to them handy at all times, you will consult them.</li>
<li>Read up on OSGi best practices, there is a large set of things you <strong>can</strong> do but a somewhat smaller set of things you <strong>should</strong> do and there are some things you should <strong>never do</strong> (DynamicImport: * for example). </li>

83764,2,,16451,9/17/2008 14:23,8,,"<p>WS-Security specifications are not typically contained in a WSDL (never in a WSE WSDL). So wsdl2java does not know that WS-Security is even required for this service. The fact that security constraints are not present in a WSE WSDL is a big disappointment to me (WCF will include WS-Trust information in a WSDL).</p>

<p>On the client end, you'll need to use <a href=""http://ws.apache.org/rampart/"">Rampart</a> to add the necessary WS-Security headers to your outgoing client message. Since the WSDL does not report what WS-Security settings are necessary, you're best off by asking the service provider what is required. WS-Security requirements may be simple plaintext password, or might be X509 certificates, or might be encrypted message..... Rampart should be able to handle most of these scenarios.</p>

<p>Apache Rampart is ""turned on"" by engaging the module in your axis2.xml file. You'll need to download the Rampart module and put it in a specific place in your axis2 directory, then modify the xml file. You can also engage Rampart programatically (please edit your original question if this is a requirement and I'll edit this response).</p>

<p>Depending on how you configure rampart (through other XML files or programatically), it will intercept any outgoing messages and add the necessary WS-Security information to it. I've personally used axis2 with rampart to call a WSE3 service that is secured with UsernameToken in plaintext and it worked great. Similar, but more advanced scenarios should also work.  There are more details on how to set up and get started with Rampart on the site linked above. If you have problems about the specifics of Rampart or how to use Rampart with your particular WSE setup, then edit your question and I'll try my best to answer.</p>

711398,2,,16451,4/2/2009 20:08,8,,"<p>This seems to be a popular question so I'll provide an overview of what we did in our situation.</p>

<p>It seems that services built in .NET are following an older ws-addressing standard (<a href=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/03/addressing/"">http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/03/addressing/</a>) and axis2 only understands the newer standard (<a href=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/08/addressing/"">http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/08/addressing/</a>).</p>

<p>In addition, the policyCache.config file provided is in a form that the axis2 rampart module can't understand.</p>

<p>So the steps we had to do, in a nutshell:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read the policyCache.config and try to understand it.  Then rewrite it into a policy that rampart could understand.  (Some <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/466238/Official-Documentation-ws-apache-org-Axis2-Part-2"">updated docs</a> helped.)</li>
<li>Configure rampart with this policy.</li>
<li>Take the keys that were provided in the .pfx file and convert them to a java key store.  There is a utility that comes with Jetty that can do that.</li>
<li>Configure rampart with that key store.</li>
<li>Write a custom axis2 handler that backward-converts the newer ws-addressing stuff that comes out of axis2 into the older stuff expected by the service.</li>
<li>Configure axis2 to use the handler on outgoing messages.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end it was a lot of configuration and code for something that is supposed to be an open standard supported by the vendors.</p>

<p>Although I'm not sure what the alternative is...can you wait for the vendors (or in this case, the one vendor) to make sure that everything will inter-op?</p>

<p>As a postscript I'll add that I didn't end up doing the work, it was someone else on my team, but I think I got the salient details correct.  The other option that I was considering (before my teammate took over) was to call the WSS4J API directly to construct the SOAP envelope as the .NET service expected it.  I think that would have worked too.</p>

You can also deploy your <a href=""http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-site-plugin/examples/site-deploy-to-sourceforge.net.html"">site to SourceForge</a> via SCP.</p>

<p>You would configure the SourceForge server in your settings.xml to use a ""combined"" username with a comma separator. With these credentials:</p>

SourceForge project name: bar
Path: /home/frs/project/P/PR/PROJECT_UNIX_NAME/

  &lt;username&gt;foo,bar&lt;/username&gt;
  &lt;password&gt;secret&lt;/password&gt;
&lt;/server&gt;

<p>And the distributionManagement section in your POM would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- Enabling the use of FTP --&gt;

    &lt;id&gt;ssh-repository&lt;/id&gt;

First up I had the mvn site:deploy working following the instructions at <a href=""http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-site-plugin/examples/site-deploy-to-sourceforge.net.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this sourceforge site</a>. Basically you start the sourceforge shell with </p>

<pre><code>ssh -t user,project@shell.sourceforge.net create
</code></pre>

<p>That will create the shell at their end with a folder mounted to your project on a path such as (depending on your projects name):</p>

    &lt;/servers&gt;

<p>In the pom.xml you just need your distibutionManagement section setup to name the server by ID that you set the password for in your settings file: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;distributionManagement&gt;
    &lt;site&gt;
        &lt;id&gt;chex4j.sf.net&lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;url&gt;scp://shell.sourceforge.net/home/groups/c/ch/chex4j/htdocs/

    &lt;/site&gt;
    &lt;repository&gt;
        &lt;id&gt;chex4j.sf.net&lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;SourceForge shell repo&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;url&gt;scp://shell.sourceforge.net/home/groups/c/ch/chex4j/htdocs/maven2&lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;/repository&gt;
&lt;/distributionManagement&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There the repository entry is the one for the mvn deploy command and the site entry is for the mvn site:deploy command. Then all I have to do is start the shell connection to bring up the server side then on my local side just run: </p>

<pre><code>mvn deploy
</code></pre>

<p>which uploads the jar, pom and sources and the like onto my sourceforge projects website. If you try to hit the /maven2 folder on your project website sourceforge kindly tell you that directory listing is off by default and how to fix it. To do this on the server shell you create a .htaccess file in your htdocs/maven2 folder containing the following apache options </p>

<pre><code>Options +Indexes
</code></pre>

<p>Then bingo, you have a maven repo which looks like: </p>

<p><a href=""http://chex4j.sourceforge.net/maven2/net/sf/chex4j/chex4j-core/1.0.0/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chex4j.sourceforge.net/maven2/net/sf/chex4j/chex4j-core/1.0.0/</a></p>

<p>Your sf.net shell it shuts down after a number of hours to not hog resources; so you run the ""ssh -t ... create"" when you want to deploy the site or your build artifacts. </p>

<p>You can browse all my maven project code under sourceforge to see my working settings: </p>

After posting my question I went on and modified the compile task with the attributes <code>fork=""true""</code>, <code>memoryinitialsize=""256m""</code> and <code>memorymaximumsize=""1024m""</code> (a found today that this was suggested by Kieron and jmanning2k, thanks for your time). This didn't solve the problem nonetheless.</p>

<p>I decided to start removing classes from the source tree to see if a could pinpoint the problem. Turns out we had a Web Service client class for <a href=""http://ws.apache.org/axis/"" rel=""nofollow"">Axis 1.4</a> that was auto-generated from a WSDL file. Now, this class is a monster (as in Frankenstein), it has 167 field members (all of them of type String), 167 getter/setter pairs (1 for each field), a constructor that receives all 167 fields as parameters, an equals method that compares all 167 fields in a strange way. For each field the comparison goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>(this.A == null &amp;&amp; other.getA() == null) || (this.A != null &amp;&amp; this.A.equals(other.getA()))
</code></pre>

<p>The result of this comparison is ""anded"" (&amp;&amp;) with the result of the comparison of the next field, and so on. The class goes on with a hashCode method that also uses all fields, some custom XML serialization methods and a method that returns a Axis-specific metadata object that describes the class and that also uses all field members.</p>

<p>This class is never modified, so I just put a compiled version in the application classpath and the project compiled without issues. </p>

<p>Now, I know that removing this single source file solved the problem. However, I have absolutely no idea as to why this particular class caused the problem. It will be nice to know; what can cause or causes a StackOverflowError during compilation of Java code? I think I'll post that question.</p>

<p>It is probable that evaluating the long expression in your java file consumes lots of memory and because this is being done in conjunction with the compilation of other classes, the VM just runs out of stack space. Your generated class is perhaps pushing the legal limits for its contents. See chapter <a href=""http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jvms/second_edition/html/ClassFile.doc.html#88659"" rel=""nofollow"">4.10 Limitations of the Java Virtual Machine</a> in <a href=""http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jvms/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Java Virtual Machine Specification, Second Edition</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Fix 1: refactor the class</strong></p>

<p>Since your class is being generated, this might not be an option. Still, it is worth looking at the options your class generation tool offers to see if it can produce something less troublesome.</p>

<p><strong>Fix 2: increase the stack size</strong></p>

<p>I think <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16935/ants-javac-tasks-throws-stackoverflowexception#16982"" rel=""nofollow"">Kieron</a> has one solution when he mentions the -Xss argument. <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javac.html"" rel=""nofollow"">javac</a> takes a number of non-standard arguments that will vary between versions and compiler vendors.</p>

<p>My compiler:</p>

<pre><code>$ javac -version
javac 1.6.0_05
</code></pre>

<p>To list all the options for it, I'd use these commands:</p>

<pre><code>javac -help
javac -X
javac -J-X
</code></pre>

<p>I <em>think</em> the stack limit for javac is 512Kb by default. You can increase the stack size for this compiler to 10Mb with this command:</p>

<pre><code>javac -J-Xss10M Foo.java
</code></pre>

<p>You might be able to pass this in an Ant file with a <em>compilerarg</em> element nested in your <em>javac</em> task.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;javac srcdir=""gen"" destdir=""gen-bin"" debug=""on"" fork=""true""&gt;
    &lt;compilerarg value=""-J-Xss10M"" /&gt;

<p>from the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16935/ants-javac-tasks-throws-stackoverflowexception/19782#19782"">comment above</a> is incorrect. You need a space between the -J and -X, like so:</p>

<p>So the link now becomes: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""mailto:someone@yoursite.com?subject=Mail from Our Site""&gt;Email Us&lt;/a&gt;

<p>This can be very useful if you have links on pages with different subjects. You might have the email on each page go to the appropriate person in a company but with a copy of all mails sent to a central address also. </p>

<p>You can of course specify more than one additional recipient, just separate your list of recipients with a comma. </p>

<p>You can combine the various bits of code above by the addition of an '&amp;' between each.</p>

<p>Thus adding </p>

<pre><code>me@mysite.com?subject=Hello&amp;cc=you@yoursite.com&amp;bcc=her@hersite.com
</code></pre>

<p>would send an email with the subject 'Hello' to me, you and her. </p>

<p><strong>4. Write the Email</strong> </p>

<p>You can also prefill the body of the email with the start of a message, or write the whole message if you like! To add some thing to the body of the email it is again as simple as above - '<strong>?body=</strong>' after the email address. However formatting that email can be a little tricky. To create spaces between words you will have to use hex code - for example '<strong>%20</strong>' between each word, and to create new lines will mean adding '<strong>%0D</strong>'. Similarly symbols such as <strong>$</strong> signs will need to be written in hex code.</p>

<p>If you also wish to add a subject line and send copies to multiple recipients, this can make for a very long and difficult to write bit of code. </p>

<p>It will send a message to three people, with the subject and the message filled in, all you need to do is add your name. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>For percent-encoding mailto URI hnames and hvalues, I use the rules at <a href=""http://shadow2531.com/opera/testcases/mailto/modern_mailto_uri_scheme.html#encoding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shadow2531.com/opera/testcases/mailto/modern_mailto_uri_scheme.html#encoding</a>.

<p>Basically, I use:</p>

<pre><code>private String encodex(final String s) {
    try {
        return java.net.URLEncoder.encode(s, ""utf-8"").replaceAll(""\\+"", ""%20"").replaceAll(""\\%0A"", ""%0D%0A"");
    } catch (Throwable x) {
        return s;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The string that's passed in should be a string with \r\n, and stray \r already normalized to \n.</p>

<p>Also note that just returning the original string on an exception like above is only safe if the mailto URI argument you're passing on the command-line is properly escaped and quoted.</p>

<p>On windows that means:</p>

<ol>
<li>Quote the argument.</li>
<li>Escape any "" inside the quotes with \.</li>
<li>Escape any \ that precede a "" or the end of the string with \.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, on windows, if you're dealing with UTF-16 strings like in Java, you might want to use ShellExecuteW to ""open"" the mailto URI. If you don't and return s on an exception (where some hvalue isn't completely percent-encoded, you could end up narrowing some wide characters and losing information. But, not all mail clients accept unicode arguments, so ideally, you want to pass a properly percent-encoded-utf8 ascii argument with ShellExecute.</p>

<p>Like 'start', ShellExecute with ""open"" should open the mailto URI in the default client.</p>

<p>Not sure about other OS's.</p>

<p>However, another set of problems that you may come across can be related to single/multi-byte character encodings. If you see strange unexpected chars (not at end-of-line) then this could be the reason. Especially if you see square boxes, question marks, upside-down question marks, extra characters or unexpected accented characters.</p>

<p>Running the command <strong>locale</strong> on your *nix box will tell you what the system locale is. If this is different to the encoding used in the text files that have been transferred over from the windows machine, then this can sometimes cause issues, depending on the usage of those files. You can use the very powerful <strong>recode</strong> command to try and convert between the different charsets as well as any line ending issues. <strong>recode -l</strong> will show you all of the formats and encodings that the tool can convert between. It is likely to be a VERY long list.</p>

<p>When writing to files or reading from files (that you are in control of), it is often worth specifying the encoding to use, as most Java methods allow this. However, also ensuring that the system locale matches can save a lot of pain.</p>

<p>Having said that, .NET also lacks stuff Java has. E.g. the ease of EJBs, frameworks that can compete with e.g. Spring etc. </p>

<p>I am a Java EE developer for over 10 years and lately, I must say I'm really beginning to dislike Java. Frameworks like JSF make my hair fall out. A bunch of open-source stuff like M2eclipse does not work well. A LOT of bugs in eclipse. Many eclipse packages that are not compatible with each other resulting in NullPointerExceptions in your error console, build problems etc etc.. Shoot me but I have lost my faith in open source. It does not work at a level you could call 'professional'.  I feel such is merele logical: in a company you have some pressure from people who will call the helpdesk, law-suits because stuff is bad etc and so some manager(s) will do the best they can to make sure all works together. Of course, software will always have bugs. However, when I compare my years as a C++ developer using Microsof Visual Studio against my years using Eclipse or Netbeans, I must dat Dev Studio gave me never headache. It always worked and I cannot remember it having crashed once... Eclipse? I could write a book!!</p>

<p>So I agree with what i read somewhere: while open-source may be free and costless, the loss in productivity is huge compared to what I had years ago...

RMS is designed to store small amounts of data (High score tables, or whatever) not large amounts.</p>

<p>You might find that some platforms are faster with files stored in multiple record stores. Some are faster with multiple records within one store. Many are ok for storage, but become unusably slow when deleting large amounts of data from the store.</p>

<p>Your best bet is to use JSR-75 instead where available, and create your own file store interface that falls back to RMS if nothing better is supported.</p>

RMS records are extremely limited in size and speed, even in some higher end handsets. If you need to juggle 1MB of data in J2ME the only reliable, portable way is to store it on the network. The HttpConnection class and the GET and POST methods are always supported.</p>

<p>On the handsets that support JSR 75 FileConnection it may be valid alternative but without code signing it is an user experience nightmare. Almost every single API call will invoke a security prompt with no blanket permission choice. Companies that deploy apps with JSR 75 usually need half a dozen binaries for every port just to cover a small part of the possible certificates. And this is just for the manufacturer certificates; some handsets only have carrier-locked certificates.</p>

In the end the simplest solution was to limit the amount of data being stored, implementing code that adjusts the data according to how large the store is, and fetching data from the server on demand if its not stored locally. Thats interesting that the limit is increased in OS 4.6, with any luck my code will simply adjust on its own and store more data :)</p>

<p>Developing a J2ME application for Blackberry without using the .cod compiler limits the use of JSR 75 some what since we can't sign the archive. As pointed out by Carlos this is a problem on any platform and I've had similar issues using the PIM part of it. The RMS seems to be incredibly slow on the Blackberry platform so I'm not sure how useful a inode/b-tree file system on top would be, unless data was cached in memory and written to RMS in a low priority background thread.</p>

<p>In C++ you have pointers, which are more powerful (or less powerful depending on your interpretation of power) object references, which you already know about from Java.</p>

In C++, you have to free the memory explicitly when you are done with an object.

<p>The Market may be dominated by few large games, but that does not mean that there is not a lot of room for more niche games. Lets face it: If you want to reach 100.000+ players, you're ending up building your own technology stack, at least for the critical core. That's what CCP did for EVE Online (<a href=""http://myeve.eve-online.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=584"">StacklessIO</a>), that's what Blizzard did for World of Warcraft (although they do use many third-party libraries), that's what Mythic did for Warhammer Online (although they are based on Gamebryo).</p>

<p>However, if you aim to be a small, niche MMO (like the dozens of Free-to-Play/Itemshop MMOs), then getting the Network stuff right is just insanely hard, data consistency is even harder and scalability is the biggest b*tch.</p>

<p>But game technology is not your only problem - you also need to tackle Billing. Credit Card only? Have fun selling in Germany then, people there want ELV. That's where you need a reliable billing provider, but you still need to wire in the billing application with your accounts to make sure that accounts are blocked/reactivated when the billing fails.</p>

<p>There are some companies already offering ""MMO Infratructure Services"" (i.e. <a href=""http://www.e-eis.com/cms/front_content.php?changelang=2"">Arvato's EEIS</a>), but the bottom line is: Stuff like Project Darkstar IS realistic, but assuming that you can build a Multi-Billion-MMO entirely on a Third Party Stack is optimistic, possibly idealistic.</p>

<p>But then again, entirely inventing all of the technology is even more stupid - use the Third Party stuff that you need (i.e. Billing, Font Rendering, Audio Output...), but <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001172.html"">write the stuff that really makes or breaks your business</a> (i.e. Network stack, User interface etc.) on your own. (Note: Jeff's posting may be <a href=""http://damilare.net/random-talks/dare-obasanjo-vs-jeff-atwood-on-html-validation/"">a bit flawed</a>, but the overall direction is correct IMHO.)</p>

<p>Addendum: Also, the game industry does license and reuse engines a lot. The most prominent game Engines are the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine"">Unreal Engine</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Engine"">Source Engine</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_tech"">id Tech</a>, which fuel dozens, if not hundreds of games. But there are some lesser-known (outside of the industry) engines. There is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebryo"">Gamebryo</a>, the Middleware behind games like Civilization 4 and Fallout 3, there was <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RenderWare"">RenderWare</a> that is now only EA-in-House, but used in games like Battlefield 2 or The Sims 3. There is the open source <a href=""http://www.ogre3d.org/"">Ogre3d</a>, which was used in <a href=""http://www.dtp-entertainment.com/en/games/game_detail.php?id=2973&amp;landid=1"">some</a> commercial <a href=""http://www.venetica-game.com/"">titles</a>. If you're just looking for Sound, there's stuff like <a href=""http://www.fmod.org/"">FMOD</a> or if you want to do font-rendering, why not give <a href=""http://www.freetype.org/"">FreeType</a> a spin?</p>

<p>What I'm saying is: Third-Party Engines/Middleware do exist, and they ARE being successfully used since more than a decade (I know for sure that id's Wolfenstein Engine was licensed to other companies, and that was 1992), even by big companies in multi-million-dollar titles. The important thing is the support, because a good engine with no help in case of an issue is pretty much worthless or at least very expensive if the developer has to spend their game-development-time with unneccessary debugging of the Engine.</p>

<p>If the Darkstar folks manage to get the support side right and 2 or 3 higher profile titles out, I do believe it could succeed in opening the MMO market to a lot more smaller developers and indies.</p>

24499,2,,21207,8/23/2008 19:03,51,,"<p>We run DB40 .NET version in a large client/server project.</p>

<p>Our experiences is that you can potentially get much better performance than typical relational databases.</p>

<p>However, you really have to tweak your objects to get this kind of performance. For example, if you've got a list containing a lot of objects, DB4O activation of these lists is slow. There are a number of ways to get around this problem, for example, by inverting the relationship.</p>

<p>Another pain is activation. When you retrieve or delete an object from DB4O, by default it will activate the whole object tree. For example, loading a Foo will load Foo.Bar.Baz.Bat, etc until there's nothing left to load. While this is nice from a programming standpoint, performance will slow down the more nesting in your objects. To improve performance, you can tell DB4O how many levels deep to activate. This is time-consuming to do if you've got a lot of objects.</p>

<p>Another area of pain was text searching. DB4O's text searching is far, far slower than SQL full text indexing. (They'll tell you this outright on their site.) The good news is, it's easy to setup a text searching engine on top of DB4O. On our project, we've hooked up Lucene.NET to index the text fields we want.</p>

<p>Some APIs don't seem to work, such as the GetField APIs useful in applying database upgrades. (For example, you've renamed a property and you want to upgrade your existing objects in the database, you need to use these ""reflection"" APIs to find objects in the database. Other APIs, such as the [Index] attribute don't work in the stable 6.4 version, and you must instead specify indexes using the Configure().Index(""someField""), which is not strongly typed.</p>

<p>We've witnessed performance degrade the larger your database. We have a 1GB database right now and things are still fast, but not nearly as fast as when we started with a tiny database.</p>

<p>We've found another issue where Db4O.GetByID will close the database if the ID doesn't exist anymore in the database.</p>

<p>We've found the Native Query syntax (the most natural, language-integrated syntax for queries) is far, far slower than the less-friendly SODA queries. So instead of typing:</p>

<pre><code>// C# syntax for ""Find all MyFoos with Bar == 23"".
// (Note the Java syntax is more verbose using the Predicate class.)
IList&lt;MyFoo&gt; results = db4o.Query&lt;MyFoo&gt;(input =&gt; input.Bar == 23);
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of that nice query code, you have to an ugly SODA query which is string-based and not strongly-typed.</p>

<p>For .NET folks, they've recently introduced a LINQ-to-DB4O provider, which provides for the best syntax yet. However, it's yet to be seen whether performance will be up-to-par with the ugly SODA queries.</p>

<p>DB4O support has been decent: we've talked to them on the phone a number of times and have received helpful info. Their user forums are next to worthless, however, almost all questions go unanswered. Their JIRA bug tracker receives a lot of attention, so if you've got a nagging bug, file it on JIRA on it often will get fixed. (We've had 2 bugs that have been fixed, and another one that got patched in a half-assed way.)</p>

<p>If all this hasn't scared you off, let me say that we're very happy with DB4O, despite the problems we've encountered. The performance we've got has blown away some O/RM frameworks we tried. I recommend it.</p>

<p>Personally, I think exceptions are strictly for when you can't implement a normal code solution.  The performance hit and handling restrictions are just a bit too much for me.</p>

<p>Another reason for using a list of status objects is that identifying multiple errors (such as during validation) is MUCH easier.  After all, you can only throw one exception which must be handled before moving on.  </p>

<p>Imagine a user submitting an email that had a malformed destination address and contained language that you are blocking.  Do you throw the malformed email exception, then, after they fix that and resubmit, throw a bad language exception?  From a user experience perspective dealing with all of them at once is a better way to go.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> combining answers</p>

<p>@Jonathan: My point was that I can evaluate the action, in this case sending an email, and send back multiple failure reasons. For example, ""bad email address"", ""blank message title"", etc..</p>

<p>With an exception, you're limited to just percolating the one problem then asking the user to resubmit at which point they find out about a second problem. This is really bad UI design.</p>

<p>Reinventing the wheel.. possibly. However, most applications should analyze the whole transaction in order to give the best possible information to the user. Imagine if your compiler stopped dead at the first error. You then fix the error and hit compile again only to have it stop again for a different error. What a pain in the butt. To me, that's exactly the problem with throwing exceptions and hence the reason I said to use a different mechanism.</p>

<pre><code>def parse_some_attrs(fname):

In tracing the GC starts from the ""roots"" - things like stack references, and traces all reachable (live) objects. Anything that can't be reached is considered dead. In reference counting each time a reference is modified the object's involved have their count updated. Any object whose reference count gets set to zero is considered dead.</p>

<p>With basically all GC implementations there are trade offs but tracing is usually good for high through put (i.e. fast) operation but has longer pause times (larger gaps where the UI or program may freeze up).

Another drawback of the way Java does GC is that you have to tell the jvm what heap size you want (if the default is not good enough); the JVM derives from that value several thresholds that will trigger the GC process when there is too much garbage stacking up in the heap.</p>

<p>I presume that this is actually the main cause of the jerky feeling of Android (based on Java), even on the most expensive cellphones, in comparison with the smoothness of iOS (based on ObjectiveC, and using RC). </p>

<p>I'd love to see a jvm option to enable RC memory management, and maybe keeping GC only to run as a last resort when there is no more memory left. </p>

<p>If you take a look at the source code of the class java.util.regex.Pattern, you'll see that it uses an internal representation of Node instances. Each of the different pattern components have their own implementation of a Node subclass. These Nodes are organised into a tree.</p>

  <p>Spolsky:  Yep.  There's a new product also, if you don't want to use the Team System there our friends at Redgate have a product called SQL Data Generator [<a href=""http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql_data_generator/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql_data_generator/index.htm</a>].  It's $295, and it just generates some realistic test data.  And it does things like actually generate real cities in the city column that actually exist, and then when it generates those it'll get the state right, instead of getting the state wrong, or putting states into German cities and stuff like... you know, it generates pretty realistic looking data.  I'm not really sure what all the features are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is probably not what you are looking for, but it might be a good starting off point, instead of creating your own.</p>

<p>I can't seem to find anything in google, so I would suggest tackling the problem by parsing a given regular expression into the smallest units of work (\w, [x-x], \d, etc) and writing some basic methods to support those regular expression phrases.</p>

<p>So for \w you would have a method getRandomLetter() which returns any random letter, and you would also have getRandomLetter(char startLetter, char endLetter) which gives you a random letter between the two values.</p>

<p>It's pretty new, and so it's a bit raw and underdocumented.  It uses asm (<a href=""http://asm.objectweb.org/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://asm.objectweb.org/index.html</a>) to dynamically redefine the class bytecode, so it can mock out all methods including static, private, constructors, and static initializers.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>import mockit.Mockit;

...
Mockit.redefineMethods(MyClassWithStaticInit.class,
                       MyReplacementClass.class);
...
class MyReplacementClass {
  public void $init() {...} // replace default constructor
  public static void $clinit{...} // replace static initializer
  public static void myStatic{...} // replace static method
  // etc...
}
</code></pre>

<p>It has an Expectations interface allowing record/playback scenarios as well:</p>

<pre><code>import mockit.Expectations;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

public class ExpecationsTest {
  private MyClass obj;

  @Test
  public void testFoo() {
    new Expectations(true) {
      MyClass c;
      {
        obj = c;
        invokeReturning(c.getFoo(""foo"", false), ""bas"");
      }
    };

    assert ""bas"".equals(obj.getFoo(""foo"", false));

    Expectations.assertSatisfied();
  }

  public static class MyClass {
    public String getFoo(String str, boolean bool) {
      if (bool) {
        return ""foo"";
      } else {

489089,2,,22697,1/28/2009 20:01,4,,"<p>The best solution to mocking is to have the machine do all the work with automated specification-based testing. For Java, see <a href=""http://www.scalacheck.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">ScalaCheck</a> and the <a href=""http://functionaljava.googlecode.com/svn/artifacts/2.17/javadoc/fj/test/package-summary.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Reductio</a> framework included in the <a href=""http://functionaljava.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Functional Java</a> library. With automated specification-based testing frameworks, you supply a specification of the method under test (a property about it that should be true) and the framework generates tests as well as mock objects, automatically.</p>

<p>For example, the following property tests the Math.sqrt method to see if the square root of any positive number n squared is equal to n.</p>

<pre><code>val propSqrt = forAll { (n: Int) =&gt; (n &gt;= 0) ==&gt; scala.Math.sqrt(n*n) == n }
</code></pre>

<p>When you call <code>propSqrt.check()</code>, ScalaCheck generates hundreds of integers and checks your property for each, also automatically making sure that the edge cases are covered well.</p>

<p>Even though ScalaCheck is written in Scala, and requires the Scala Compiler, it's easy to test Java code with it. The Reductio framework in Functional Java is a pure Java implementation of the same concepts.</p>

Frame frame = SWT_AWT.new_Frame(comp);
JFreeChart chart = createChart();
ChartPanel chartPanel = new ChartPanel(chart);

<p>The idea of putting the chart into a web page is probably not a great way to go.

Frankly, I think it is probably overkill as @Mike Deck points out. For such a small set of items to compare and process I think arrays would be a better choice from a procedural standpoint but here is my pseudo-coded (because I'm lazy) solution. I have an assumption that the Foo class is comparable based on it's unique id and not all of the data in it's contents:</p>

<pre><code>Collection&lt;Foo&gt; oldSet = ...;
Collection&lt;Foo&gt; newSet = ...;

private Collection difference(Collection a, Collection b) {
Collection result = a.clone();
result.removeAll(b)

private Collection intersection(Collection a, Collection b) {
Collection result = a.clone();
result.retainAll(b)
return result;
}

    // if foo is in(*) oldSet but not newSet, call doRemove(foo)
    Collection removed = difference(oldSet, newSet);
    if (!removed.isEmpty()) {
    	loop removed {
    		Foo foo = removedIter.next();
    		doRemove(foo);
    	}
    }
//else if foo is not in oldSet but in newSet, call doAdd(foo)
Collection added = difference(newSet, oldSet);
if (!added.isEmpty()) {
	loop added  {
		Foo foo = addedIter.next();
		doAdd(foo);
	}
}

// else if foo is in both collections but modified, call doUpdate(oldFoo, newFoo)
Collection matched = intersection(oldSet, newSet);
Comparator comp = new Comparator() {
	int compare(Object o1, Object o2) {
		Foo f1, f2;
		if (o1 instanceof Foo) f1 = (Foo)o1;
		if (o2 instanceof Foo) f2 = (Foo)o2;
		return f1.activated == f2.activated ? f1.startdate.compareTo(f2.startdate) == 0 ? ... : f1.startdate.compareTo(f2.startdate) : f1.activated ? 1 : 0;
	}

	boolean equals(Object o) {
		// equal to this Comparator..not used
	}
}
loop matched {
	Foo foo = matchedIter.next();
	Foo oldFoo = oldSet.get(foo);
	Foo newFoo = newSet.get(foo);
	if (comp.compareTo(oldFoo, newFoo ) != 0) {
		doUpdate(oldFoo, newFoo);
	} else {
		//else if !foo.activated &amp;&amp; foo.startDate &gt;= now, call doStart(foo)

<p>As far as your questions:
If I convert oldSet and newSet into HashMap (order is not of concern here), with the IDs as keys, would it made the code easier to read and easier to compare? How much of time &amp; memory performance is loss on the conversion?
I think that you would probably make the code more readable by using a Map BUT...you would probably use more memory and time during the conversion.</p>

<p>Would iterating the two sets and perform the appropriate operation be more efficient and concise?
Yes, this would be the best of both worlds especially if you followed @Mike Sharek 's advice of Rolling your own List with the specialized methods or following something like the Visitor Design pattern to run through your collection and process each item.</p>

Posting it in this thread just incase anyone else hits this thread wanting to do the same (since it is the first thread that comes up in google).

<p>No, but VB and C# have <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/dotnetattributes.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">attributes</a> which are the same thing.</p>

<p>Their use is quite diverse. One typical Java example, <code>@Override</code> has no effect on the code but it can be used by the compiler to generate a warning (or error) if the decorated method doesn't actually override another method. Similarly, methods can be marked obsolete.</p>

<p>Then there's reflection. When you reflect a type of a class in your code, you can access the attributes and act according to the information found there.

They also control how the IDE form designer works.</p>

<p>/EDIT: Attributes on classes are comparable to tag interfaces (like <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Serializable</a> in Java). However, the .NET coding guidelines say not to use tag interfaces. Also, they only work on class level, not on method level.</p>

<p>And, of course, there are a million smaller frameworks and tools that get their own following (<a href=""http://velocity.apache.org/"">Velocity</a> for basic needs, raw <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages"">JSPs</a>, Struts, etc).  I generally prefer component oriented frameworks myself, though.  </p>

<p>In the end, I'd recommend just taking a look at Tapestry, Wicket, and JSF and just picking the one that feels the best to you.  You'll probably find one that just fits the way you like to work very quickly.</p>

40194,2,,24596,9/2/2008 18:20,11,,"<p>UPDATE: Tapestry 5.2 is out, so it's not abandoned, as it previously appeared to be. My experience is with Tapestry 4, not 5, so your mileage may vary. My opinion of Tapestry has changed over the years; I have modified this post to reflect it.</p>

<p>I can no longer recommend Tapestry as I did previously. Tapestry 5 appears to be a significant improvement, but my main issue with Tapestry is not with platform itself; it's with the people behind it.</p>

<p>Historically, every major version update of Tapestry has broken backwards compatibility with extreme prejudice, far more than one might expect. This seems to be due to the incorporation of new coding techniques or technologies that require significant rewrites.</p>

<p>Howard Lewis Ship (the principal author of Tapestry) is certainly a brilliant developer, but I can't say I care for his management of the Tapestry project. Development of Tapestry 5 began almost immediately after Tapestry 4 shipped. From what I can tell, Ship pretty much devoted himself to that, leaving Tapestry 4 in the hands of other contributors, who I feel are not nearly as capable as Ship. After having made the painful switch from Tapestry 3 to Tapestry 4, I felt that I had been abandoned almost immediately.</p>

<p>Of course, with the release of Tapestry 5, Tapestry 4 became a legacy product. I wouldn't have a problem with this if the upgrade path wasn't so brutal <strong>again</strong>. So now our development team is in the rather unenviable position: We could continue to use an essentially abandoned web platform (Tapestry 4), make the heinous upgrade to Tapestry 5, or give up on Tapestry entirely and rewrite our application using another platform. None of these options is very attractive.</p>

<p>Tapestry 5 is supposedly written so as to reduce the likelihood of update breakage from this point forward. A good example is in the page classes: in previous incarnations, page classes descended from a base class provided by Tapestry; incompatible API changes in this class were the cause of a large number of backward compatibility problems. In Tapestry 5, pages are POJOs which are enhanced at runtime with the ""magic Tapestry fairy dust"" via annotations. So as long as the contract for the annotations is maintained, changes to Tapestry won't affect your page classes.</p>

<p>If this is right, then writing a new application using Tapestry 5 could turn out well. But personally, I don't feel like putting my hand on the burner again.</p>

<p>Although it isn't strictly a Java framework, it depends on Groovy (if you haven't seen this before, this is a dynamic language that runs on the JVM). Most valid Java is also valid Groovy, so it is pretty easy to learn.</p>

<p>My last project used Grails, and whilst I'd never used Groovy before, I discovered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Groovy is a joy to use, so much more fun than Java</li>
<li>There is very little configuration to do, no XML and you're up and running with a full database application in less than an hour</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a downside: it is a very ""clever"" framework that hides a lot from you, so when things go wrong it can be very time consuming to find the problem.</p>

<p>The project I mentioned would simply not have shipped on time or on budget if we'd gone for a more traditional framework (even one that we're familar and skilled with such as SpringMVC), so Grails is definitely one that we'll continue to pick in the future.</p>

<p>Spring MVC would be a candidate, but since Spring MVC 3 it has a strange annotation overloaded programming model which doesn't use the benefits of static typing. There ore other ugly things like output parameters in methods combined with a usual return, so there are two output channels of one method. Spring MVC also tends to reeinvent the wheel and you'll have more to configure compared to other frameworks. I cannot really recommend Spring MVC though it has some nice ideas.</p>

<p>Grails is a convenient way to use Spring MVC and other established frameworks like Hibernate. Coding is fun and you'll quickly see results.</p>

<p>Just be aware that creating XML text is harder than it looks. Here's some criteria I would consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>First: how much <em>control</em> do you have on the information that goes into the xml?</li>
</ul>

<p>The less control you have on the source data, the more likely you will have trouble, and the more advantageous the library becomes. For example: (a) Can you <em>guarantee</em> that the element names will never have a character that is illegal in a name? (b) How about quotes in an attribute's content? Can they happen, and are you handling them? (c) Does the data ever contain anything that might need to be encoded as an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_entity"" rel=""nofollow"">entity</a> (like the less-than which often needs to be output as <strong>&amp;lt;</strong>); are you doing it correctly?</p>

<ul>
<li>Second, maintainability: is the code that builds the XML easy to understand <em>by someone else</em>?</li>
</ul>

<p>You probably don't want to be stuck with the code for life. I've worked with second-hand C++ code that hand-builds XML and it can be surprisingly obscure. Of course, if this is a personal project of yours, then you don't need to worry about ""others"": substitute ""in a year"" for ""others"" above.</p>

<p>I wouldn't worry about performance. If your XML is simple enough that you can hand-write it, any overhead from the library is probably meaningless. Of course, your case might be different, but you should measure to prove it first.</p>

<p>Finally, Yes; you can hand build XML text by hand if it's simple enough; but not knowing the libraries available is <em>probably</em> not the right reason.</p>

<p>A modern XML library is a quite powerful tool, but it can also be daunting. However, learning the essentials of your XML library is not that hard, and it can be quite handy; among other things, it's almost a requisite in today's job marketplace. Just don't get bogged down by namespaces, schemas and other fancier features until you get the essentials.</p>

<p>It wouldn't make sense in this context to use the array argument as in <code>Collection.toArray( T[] )</code>. The only reason an array is used there is because the same (pre-allocated) array is used to contain the results (if the array is large enough to fit them all in). This saves on allocating a new array at run-time all the time.</p>

<p>However, for the purposes of education, if you did want to use the array typing, the syntax is very similar:</p>

  <p>From my understanding of this, readLine should return null the first time no input is entered other than a line termination, like '\r'.</p>

<p>That is not correct. <code>readLine</code> will return <code>null</code> if the end of the stream is reached. That is, for example, if you are reading a file, and the file ends, or if you're reading from a socket and the socket closses.</p>

<p>But if you're simply reading the console input, hitting the return key on your keyboard does not constitute an end of stream. It's simply a character that is returned (<code>\n</code> or <code>\r\n</code> depending on your OS).</p>

<p>So, if you want to break on both the empty string and the end of line, you should do:</p>

<pre><code>while (line != null &amp;&amp; !line.equals(""""))

<p>Master pages give the ability to define pages in terms of content slotted into a master template.</p>

<p>Master pages are a feature of ASP.Net (the .Net web framework), so you are looking for a feature similar to master pages in a Java web framework.  </p>

<p><a href=""http://tiles.apache.org/framework/tutorial/basic/pages.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiles.apache.org/framework/tutorial/basic/pages.html</a> gives some basic examples using Tiles and JSP to implement something similar with Struts, a Java web framework.  In this case, the Master Pages functionality is a plugin on top of Struts.</p>

<p>Velocity is a generic templating engine, not specialized for web pages and definitely more complicated than you need.  (I've seen it used for code generation.)</p>

<p>Tapestry is more of a full featured web stack than Tile, and is probably good for your purposes.  Its templating functionality involves creating a component and putting all common markup in that.  An example is at <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/articles/tapestry5-intro"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/articles/tapestry5-intro</a>.</p>

<p>The specifics of this differ based on which Java web framework you choose.</p>

<p>The Facelets <code>&lt;ui:insert/&gt;</code> tag is comparable to the ASP.NET <code>&lt;asp:ContentPlaceHolder/&gt;</code> tag used in master pages; it lets you provide default content for that area of the page, but this can be overridden.</p>

<p>To fill the Facelets template in another page, you start with a <code>&lt;ui:composition/&gt;</code> element that points to the template file.  This is roughly equivalent to declaring the MasterPageFile attribute in an ASP.NET page.</p>

<p>Inside the <code>&lt;ui:composition/&gt;</code> element, you use <code>&lt;ui:define/&gt;</code> elements to override the template defaults, similar to the way an <code>&lt;asp:Content/&gt;</code> tag is used.  These elements can contain any kind of content - from simple strings to JSF elements.</p>

<p>So, to bring it all together...</p>

<p>In <em>master.xhtml</em>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- HTML header content here --&gt;
&lt;ui:insert name=""AreaOne""&gt;Default content for AreaOne&lt;/ui:insert&gt;
&lt;ui:insert name=""AreaTwo""&gt;Default content for AreaTwo&lt;/ui:insert&gt;
&lt;!-- HTML footer content here --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In <em>page.xhtml</em>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ui:composition template=""/WEB-INF/templates/master.xhtml""&gt;
  &lt;ui:define name=""AreaOne""&gt;Here is some new content&lt;/ui:define&gt;
  &lt;ui:define name=""AreaTwo""&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some new content here too&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/ui:define&gt;
&lt;/ui:composition&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And this will render as:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- HTML header content here --&gt;
Here is some new content
&lt;p&gt;Some new content here too&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- HTML footer content here --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You also get some other benefits with Facelets, such as the ability to reuse page components with different data.</p>

<p>InPUT is probably more powerful than most use cases require, as it allows for the <strong>programming language independent formulation</strong> of experimental data (input - output), with features such as the definition of <strong>complex descriptor to class mappings</strong>, or randomized configuration spawning and validation based on predefined value ranges (for test and research, e.g. Monte Carlo simulations). You can <strong>define parameters with sub parameters, relative restrictions on parameter values (numerical param a > param b)</strong> etc. .</p>

<p>Its still in beta, but rather stable, I use it for my research, for the <strong>configuration and documentation of experiments, and for teaching purposes</strong>. Once it is available for other languages (C++ adapter in the pipe), other researchers/practitioners can reuse the descriptors running their implementations of the same algorithms in C++ (using the code mapping concept). That way, <strong>experimental results can be validated/programs can be migrated more easily</strong>. The documentation is still in working process, but a couple of <strong>examples are available</strong> on the page. InPUT is <strong>open source</strong> software.</p>

</ul>

<p>Personally I've used Netbeans' and IDEA's visual editors. Both are nice but I thought Netbeans had a leg up because it doesn't use any proprietary way of saving the GUI structure and instead does something similar to what Visual Studio does - auto-generating the code that you can then add to. IDEA stores the information in a separate file which means you have to use IDEA to edit the layout visually later.</p>

<p>I have not used Eclipse's Visual Editor.</p>

<p>My vote is for Netbeans' visual editor. I think it satisfies what most people are looking for in a visual editor and leaves it flexible enough to plug the holes manually through code without affecting the visual editor (so you can switch back and forth between code and design views without breaking either).</p>

Unlike almost every other Java GUI builder, Abeille does not generate code by default. In the project I used it on, it was wonderful to avoid reading or scrolling through the layout code (because that code no longer existed). Most of our hand-written code concerned itself with connecting events to actions, simply asking the layout for the relevant controls.</p>

<p>It's a crime that code generation is the default way to layout code in Java because better ways of doing GUIs have been around for decades. I have used Matisse, the NetBeans GUI code generator. While Matisse (now known as ""<a href=""http://netbeans.org/features/java/swing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Swing GUI Builder</a>"") makes it pleasant to layout components, it is similar to all other code generation tools because when you use Matisse you must live in constant fear that someone else edited the ""you cannot edit this in NetBeans"" GUI sections outside of NetBeans. As soon as you touch the layout builder again it could destroy their work and then you have a broken GUI. There might be some simple task like re-ordering a variable initialization and its use or re-naming a variable (this was especially a problem when using Matisse's database feature). You know how to do this by editing the un-editable source code but may waste time trying to figure out how to do the same thing in the GUI builder. Like most code generation tools, it might get you started, but eventually you will have to maintain the generated code yourself.</p>

Somebody created an [sic] InvalidArguementException that parallels java.lang.IllegalArgumentException, and we now use it in (literally) hundreds of classes. Both indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument. Talk about a waste...</p>

<p>Joshua Bloch covers this in <em>Effective Java Programming Language Guide</em> [my bible of first resort on Best Practices] <strong>Chapter 8. Exceptions</strong> <em>Item 42: Favor the use of standard exceptions</em>. Here's a bit of what he says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reusing preexisting exceptions has several benefits. Chief among these, it makes your API easier to learn and use because <strong>it matches established conventions with which programmers are already familiar</strong> [<em>my emphasis, not Bloch's</em>]. A close second is that programs using your API are easier to read because they aren't cluttered with unfamiliar exceptions. Finally, fewer exception classes mean a smaller memory footprint and less time spent loading classes.</p>
  
  <p>The most commonly reused exception is IllegalArgumentException. This is generally the exception to throw when the caller passes in an argument whose value is inappropriate. For example, this would be the exception to throw if the caller passed a negative number in a parameter representing the number of times some action were to be repeated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That said, you should <strong>never</strong> throw Exception itself. Java has a well-chosen, diverse and well-targeted bunch of built-in exceptions that cover most situations <strong>AND</strong> describe the exception that occurred well enough so that you can remedy the cause.</p>

73355,2,,27578,9/16/2008 15:06,13,,"<p>Here is my 'final rule of thumb'.<br />
I use:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>unchecked exception</strong> within the code of my method for a <strong>failure due to the caller</strong> (that involves an <strong><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/61604/api-documentation-and-value-limits-do-they-match"">explicit and complete documentation</a></strong>)</li>
<li><strong>checked exception</strong> for a <strong>failure due to the <a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/callee"">callee</a></strong> that I need to make explicit to anyone wanting to use my code</li>
</ul>

<p>Compare to the previous answer, this is a clear rationale (upon which one can agree or disagree) for the use of one or the other (or both) kind of exceptions.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>For both of those exceptions, I will create my own unchecked and checked Exception for my application (a good practice, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33497/how-do-i-recover-from-an-unchecked-exception#33564"">as mentionned here</a>), except for very common unchecked exception (like NullPointerException)</p>

<p>So for instance, the goal of this particular function below is to make (or get if already exist) an object,<br />
meaning:</p>

<ul>
<li>the container of the object to make/get MUST exist (responsibility of the CALLER<br />
=> unchecked exception, AND clear javadoc comment for this called function)</li>
<li>the other parameters can not be null<br />
(choice of the coder to put that on the CALLER: the coder will not check for null parameter but the coder DOES DOCUMENT IT)</li>
<li>the result CAN NOT BE NULL<br />
(responsibility and choice of the code of the callee, choice which will be of great interest for the caller<br />
=> checked exception because every callers MUST take a decision if the object can not be created/found, and that decision must be enforced at the compilation time: they can not use this function without having to deal with this possibility, meaning with this <em>checked</em> exception).  </li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the time you don't know if an error is ""recoverable"" because you don't know in what layer the caller of your API is located.</p>

<p>In this case the caller of the API does not want to catch the exception. He only wants to let the exception ""bubble up"". If I chose a checked exception, this caller will have plenty of useless catch block only to artificially rethrow the exception.</p>

<p><strong>Unchecked exceptions</strong> are used to let the system <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast"">fail fast</a> which is a good thing. You should clearly state what is your method expecting in order to work properly.  This way you can validate the input only once.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @params operation - The operation to execute.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the operation is ""exit""
 */
 public final void execute( String operation ) {
     if( ""exit"".equals(operation)){

     }
     this.operation = operation; 
     .....  
 }
 private void secretCode(){
      // we perform the operation.
      // at this point the opreation was validated already.
      // so we don't worry that operation is ""exit""
      .....  
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Just to put an example. The point is, if the system fails fast, then you'll know where and why it did fail.  You'll get an stacktrace like:</p>

<pre><code> IllegalArgumentException: I told you not to use ""exit"" 
 at some.package.AClass.execute(Aclass.java:5)
 at otherPackage.Otherlass.delegateTheWork(OtherClass.java:4569)
 ar ......
</code></pre>

<p>And you'll know what happened. The OtherClass in the ""delegateTheWork"" method ( at line 4569 ) called your class with the ""exit"" value, even when it shouldn't  etc.</p>

<p>Otherwise you would have to sprinkle validations all over your code and that's error prone. Plus, sometimes it is hard to track what went wrong and you may expect hours of frustrating  debugging </p>

<p>Same thing happens with NullPointerExceptions. If you have a 700 lines class with some 15 methods, that uses 30 attributes and none of them can be null, instead of validating in each of those methods for nullability you could make all those attributes read-only and validate them in the constructor or factory method.</p>

<pre><code> public static MyClass createInstane( Object data1, Object data2 /* etc */ ){ 
      if( data1 == null ){ throw NullPointerException( ""data1 cannot be null""); }

  }


  // the rest of the methods don't validate data1 anymore.
  public void method1(){ // don't worry, nothing is null 
      ....
  }
  public void method2(){ // don't worry, nothing is null 
      ....
  }
  public void method3(){ // don't worry, nothing is null 
      ....
  }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Checked exceptions</strong> Are useful when the programmer ( you or your co-workers ) did everything right, validated the input, ran tests, and all the code is perfect, but the code connects to a third party webservice that may be down ( or a file you were using  was deleted by another external process etc ) . The webservice may even be validate before the connection is attempted, but during the data transfer something went wrong.</p>

<p>In that scenario there is nothing that you or your co-workers can do to help it. But still you have to do something and not let the application just die and disappear in the eyes of the user.  You use a checked exception for that and handle the exception, what can you do when that happens?, most of the time , just to attempt to log the error, probably save your work ( the app work ) and present a message to the user. ( The site blabla is down, please retry later etc. ) </p>

<p>If the checked exception are overused ( by  adding the ""throw Exception"" in the all the methods signatures ) , then your code will become very fragile, because everyone will ignore that exception ( because is too general ) and the quality of code will be seriously compromised.</p>

<p>If you overuse unchecked exception something similar will happen. The users of that code don't know if something may go wrong an a lot of try{...}catch( Throwable t ) will appear.</p>

<p><strong>Checked Exceptions</strong> should be used to declare for <strong>expected</strong>, but <strong>unpreventable</strong> errors that are <strong>reasonable to recover</strong> from.</p>

<p><strong>Unchecked Exceptions</strong> should be used for everything else.</p>

<p>I'll break this down for you, because most people misunderstand what this means.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Expected but unpreventable</strong>: The caller did everything within their power to validate the input parameters, but some condition outside their control has caused the operation to fail. For example, you try reading a file but someone deletes it between the time you check if it exists and the time the read operation begins. By declaring a checked exception, you are telling the caller to anticipate this failure.</li>
<li><strong>Reasonable to handle</strong>: There is no point telling callers to anticipate exceptions that they cannot recover from. If a user attempts to read from an non-existing file, the caller can prompt him for a new filename. On the other hand, if the method fails due to a programming bug (invalid input parameters or buggy method implementation) there is nothing the application can do to fix the problem in mid-execution. The best it can do is log the problem and wait for the developer to fix it at a later time.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unless the exception you are throwing meets <strong>all</strong> of the above conditions it should use an Unchecked Exception.</p>

<p><strong>Reevaluate at every level</strong>: Sometimes the method catching the checked exception isn't the right place to handle the error. In that case, consider what is reasonable for your own callers. If the exception is expected, unpreventable and reasonable for them to recover then you should throw a checked exception yourself. If not, you should wrap the exception in an unchecked exception. If you follow this rule you will find yourself converting checked exceptions to unchecked exceptions and vice versa depending on what layer you are in.</p>

<p>For both checked and unchecked exceptions, <strong>use the right abstraction level</strong>. For example, a code repository with two different implementations (database and filesystem) should avoid exposing implementation-specific details by throwing <code>SQLException</code> or <code>IOException</code>. Instead, it should wrap the exception in an abstraction that spans all implementations (e.g. <code>RepositoryException</code>).</p>

23439719,2,,27578,5/3/2014 2:58,1,,"<p>Here is a very simple solution to your Checked/Unchecked dilemma.</p>

<p>Rule 1: Think of a Unchecked Exception as a testable condition before code executes.
for example…</p>

<pre><code>x.doSomething(); // the code throws a NullPointerException
</code></pre>

<p>where x is null...
…the code should possibly have the following…</p>

<pre><code>if (x==null)
{
    //do something below to make sure when x.doSomething() is executed, it won’t throw a NullPointerException.
    x = new X();
}
x.doSomething();
</code></pre>

<p>Rule 2: Think of a Checked Exception as an un-testable condition that may occur while the code executes.</p>

<pre><code>Socket s = new Socket(“google.com”, 80);
InputStream in = s.getInputStream();
OutputStream out = s.getOutputStream();
</code></pre>

<p>…in the example above, the URL (google.com) may be unavailable to due the DNS server being down. Even at the instant the DNS server was working and resolved the ‘google.com’ name to an IP address, if the connection is made to google.com, at anytime afterword, the network could go down. You simply can not test the network all the time before reading and writing to streams.</p>

<p>There are times where the code simply must execute before we can know if there is a problem. By forcing developers to write their code in such a way to force them to handle these situations via Checked Exception, I have to tip my hat to the creator of Java that invented this concept.</p>

<p>In general, almost all the APIs in Java follow the 2 rules above. If you try to write to a file, the disk could fill up before completing the write. It is possible that other processes had caused the disk to become full. There is simply no way to test for this situation. For those who interact with hardware where at any time, using the hardware can fail, Checked Exceptions seem to be an elegant solution to this problem.</p>

<p>There is a gray area to this. In the event that many tests are needed (a mind blowing if statement with lots of &amp;&amp; and ||), the exception thrown will be a CheckedException simply because it’s too much of a pain to get right — you simply can’t say this problem is a programming error. If there are much less than 10 tests (e.g. ‘if (x == null)’), then the programmer error should be a UncheckedException.</p>

<p>Things get interesting when dealing with language interpreters. According to the rules above, should a Syntax Error be considered a Checked or Unchecked Exception? I would argue that if the syntax of the language can be tested before it gets executed, it should be an UncheckedException. If the language can not be tested — similar to how assembly code runs on a personal computer, then the Syntax Error should be a Checked Exception.</p>

<p>The 2 rules above will probably remove 90% of your concern over which to choose from. To summarize the rules, follow this pattern…
1) if the code to be execute can be tested before it’s executed for it to run correctly and if an Exception occurs — a.k.a. a programmer error, the Exception should be an UncheckedException (a subclass of RuntimeException).
2) if the code to be executed can not be tested before it’s executed for it to run correctly, the Exception should be a Checked Exception (a subclass of Exception).</p>

<p><code>equals()</code> (<a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals(java.lang.Object)"">javadoc</a>) must define an equality relation (it must be <em>reflexive</em>, <em>symmetric</em>, and <em>transitive</em>). In addition, it must be <em>consistent</em> (if the objects are not modified, then it must keep returning the same value). Furthermore, <code>o.equals(null)</code> must always return false.</p>

<p><code>hashCode()</code> (<a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode()"">javadoc</a>) must also be <em>consistent</em> (if the object is not modified in terms of <code>equals()</code>, it must keep returning the same value).</p>

<p>The relation between the two methods is:</p>

<p><em>Whenever <code>a.equals(b)</code>, then <code>a.hashCode()</code> must be same as <code>b.hashCode()</code>.</em></p>

<h3>In practice:</h3>

<p>If you override one, then you should override the other.</p>

    // ...

    public int hashCode() {
        return new HashCodeBuilder(17, 31). // two randomly chosen prime numbers
            // if deriving: appendSuper(super.hashCode()).
            append(name).
            append(age).
            toHashCode();
    }

    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (obj == null)
            return false;
        if (obj == this)
            return true;
        if (!(obj instanceof Person))
            return false;

        Person rhs = (Person) obj;
        return new EqualsBuilder().
            // if deriving: appendSuper(super.equals(obj)).

<p>This statement is the result of equals() being inheritance unfriendly. The JLS (Java language specification) specifies that if A.equals(B)==true then B.equals(A) must also return true. If you omit that statement inheriting classes that override equals() (and change it's behavior) will break this specification.</p>

<p>Consider the following example of what happens when the statement is omitted:</p>

<pre><code>    class A {
      int field1;

      A(int field1) {
        this.field1 = field1;

<pre><code>A a = new A(1);
B b = new B(1,1);
a.equals(b) == true;
b.equals(a) == false;
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, this is wrong.</p>

<p>If you want to ensure the symmetric condition. a=b if b=a and the Liskov substitution principle call <code>super.equals(other)</code> not only in the case of B instance, but check after for A instance.............</p>

<pre><code>if (other instanceof B )
   return (other != null &amp;&amp; ((B)other).field2 == field2 &amp;&amp; super.equals(other)); 
if (other instanceof A) return super.equals(other);

<p>Summary:</p>

<p>In his book <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0201310058"">Effective Java Programming Language Guide</a> (Addison-Wesley, 2001), Joshua Bloch claims that ""There is simply no way to extend an instantiable class and add an aspect while preserving the equals contract.""  Tal disagrees.</p>

<p>His solution is to implement equals() by calling another nonsymmetric blindlyEquals() both ways.  blindlyEquals() is overridden by subclasses, equals() is inherited, and never overridden.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>class Point {
    private int x;
    private int y;
    protected boolean blindlyEquals(Object o) {
        if (!(o instanceof Point))
            return false;
        Point p = (Point)o;
        return (p.x == this.x &amp;&amp; p.y == this.y);
    }
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        return (this.blindlyEquals(o) &amp;&amp; o.blindlyEquals(this));
    }
}

class ColorPoint extends Point {
    private Color c;
    protected boolean blindlyEquals(Object o) {
        if (!(o instanceof ColorPoint))
            return false;
        ColorPoint cp = (ColorPoint)o;
        return (super.blindlyEquals(cp) &amp;&amp; 
        cp.color == this.color);
    }
}

256447,2,,27581,11/2/2008 2:58,163,,"<p>There are some issues worth noticing if you're dealing with classes that are persisted using an Object-Relationship Mapper (ORM) like Hibernate. If you didn't think this was unreasonably complicated already!</p>

<p><strong>Lazy loaded objects are subclasses</strong></p>

<p>If your objects are persisted using an ORM, in many cases you will be dealing with dynamic proxies to avoid loading object too early from the data store. These proxies are implemented as subclasses of your own class. This means that<code>this.getClass() == o.getClass()</code> will return false. For example:</p>

<pre><code>Person saved = new Person(""John Doe"");
Long key = dao.save(saved);
dao.flush();
Person retrieved = dao.retrieve(key);
saved.getClass().equals(retrieved.getClass()); // Will return false if Person is loaded lazy
</code></pre>

<p><em>If you're dealing with an ORM using <code>o instanceof Person</code> is the only thing that will behave correctly.</em></p>

<p><strong>Lazy loaded objects have null-fields</strong></p>

<p>ORMs usually use the getters to force loading of lazy loaded objects. This means that <code>person.name</code> will be null if <code>person</code> is lazy loaded, even if <code>person.getName()</code> forces loading and returns ""John Doe"". In my experience, this crops up more often in <code>hashCode</code> and <code>equals</code>.</p>

<p><em>If you're dealing with an ORM, make sure to always use getters, and never field references in <code>hashCode</code> and <code>equals</code>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Saving an object will change it's state</strong></p>

<p>Persistent objects often use a <code>id</code> field to hold the key of the object. This field will be automatically updated when an object is first saved. Don't use an id field in <code>hashCode</code>. But you can use it in <code>equals</code>.</p>

<p>A pattern I often use is</p>

<pre><code>if (this.getId() == null) {
    return this == other;
} else {
    return this.getId() == other.getId();
}
</code></pre>

<p>But: You cannot include <code>getId()</code> in <code>hashCode()</code>. If you do, when an object is persisted, it's <code>hashCode</code> changes. If the object is in a <code>HashSet</code>, you'll ""never"" find it again.</p>

<p>In my <code>Person</code> example, I probably would use <code>getName()</code> for <code>hashCode</code> and <code>getId</code> plus <code>getName()</code> (just for paranoia) for <code>equals</code>. It's okay if there are some risk of ""collisions"" for <code>hashCode</code>, but never okay for <code>equals</code>.</p>

<p><em><code>hashCode</code> should use the non-changing subset of properties from <code>equals</code></em></p>

<p>as int value of 10 is always equal to 10. But this equals() method is about equality of two objects. When we say object, it will have properties.

It is not necessary that all properties must be taken into account to determine the equality and with respect to the class definition and context it can be decided. Then the equals() method can be overridden.</p>

<p>we should always override hashCode() method whenever we override equals() method. If not, what will happen? If we use hashtables in our application, it will not behave as expected.

<p>One feature I really like is how easy it is to version your jars - easily keeping previous versions available for legacy users of your library.  This also works to your benefit when you want to upgrade a library you use - like junit.

   &lt;target name=""jar""&gt;
      ...
      &lt;jar jarfile=""${ant.project.name}.jar"" ...

<p>Structure your source directory structure so that you can package your build by copying whole directories, rather than naming individual files. For example, if you are copying JAR files to a web application archive, do something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;copy todir=""${war}/WEB-INF/lib"" flatten=""true""&gt;
   &lt;fileset dir=""lib"" includes=""**/*.jar""&gt;
&lt;/copy&gt;

<p>Use properties files for machine-specific and project-specific build file properties.</p>

&lt;property file=""/etc/ant/build.properties"" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Project-specific property over-rides --&gt;

&lt;!-- Default property values, used if not specified in properties files --&gt;
&lt;property name=""jboss.home"" value=""/usr/share/jboss"" /&gt;

<p>Java's heap is divided into different generations, each of which is collected using a different strategy.

You think you're saving resources, but you're actually wasting them for no good reason, forcing Java to recheck all your live objects “just in case”.</p>

<p>If you are having problems with GC pauses during critical moments, you're better off configuring the JVM to use the concurrent mark/sweep collector, which was designed specifically to minimise time spent paused, than trying to take a sledgehammer to the problem and just breaking it further.</p>

<p>(Another thing you might not know: implementing a finalize() method on your object makes garbage collection slower. Firstly, it will take <em>two</em> GC runs to collect the object: one to run finalize() and the next to ensure that the object wasn't resurrected during finalization. Secondly, objects with finalize() methods have to be treated as special cases by the GC because they have to be collected individually, they can't just be thrown away in bulk.)</p>

But if you have handles to the things that block (think e.g. sockets) potentially your code can get into deadlock situation (not trivial at all).</p>

<pre><code>SomeStream s = null;
...
try{
   s = openStream();
   ....
   s.io();

<p>It gets even more complicated if you write your own classes that work via JNI and open handles. You need to make sure handles are closed (released) and that it will happen only once. Frequently overlooked OS handle in Desktop J2SE is <code>Graphics[2D]</code>. Even <code>BufferedImage.getGrpahics()</code> can potentially return you the handle that points into a video driver (actually holding the resource on GPU). If you won't release it yourself and leave it  garbage collector to do the work - you may find strange OutOfMemory and alike situation when you ran out of video card mapped bitmaps but still have plenty of memory. In my experience it happens rather frequently in tight loops working with graphics objects (extracting thumbnails, scaling, sharpening you name it).</p>

<p>Basically GC does not take care of programmers responsibility of correct resource management. It only takes care of memory and nothing else. The Stream.finalize calling close() IMHO would be better implemented throwing exception new RuntimeError(""garbage collecting the stream that is still open""). It will save hours and days of debugging and cleaning code after the sloppy amateurs left the ends lose.</p>

<p>I think the primary consideration is how to ensure that a given voter votes only once. At a paper poll, each registered voter is restricted to a particular booth/location and verification is done by name+SSN and a signature.</p>

<p>You might need a high resolution digital signature capture and therefore a touchscreen capture peripheral or a touch screen terminal.  A more sophisticated approach would be a biometric scanner, but that would require government records of thumb/finger prints or retinal scan - I can already see the privacy advocates lining up at the lawyer's offices.</p>

<p>Another approach would be for the voter ""registrar office"" to issue digital keys to each voter prior to the election - a (relatively) short (cryptographically strong) random alpha/numeric key that is entered with the voter's name and/or SSN into the application. Knowledge of that key is required for that particular voter in that particular election.  These keys would be issued by post in tamper-evident envelopes, like those used by banks for postal confirmation of wire transfers and delivery of PIN numbers.  The key must include checksum data so that the user can have the entry of it immediately validated and it should be in groups of 4, so something like XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-CCCC.</p>

<p>Any other ""secret"" knowledge, such as SSN, is likely too easily discovered for a large percentage of the population (though we don't seem to be able to make credit-granting organizations understand this), and therefore is unsuitable for authentication.</p>

<p>Vote counting can be done by generating a public key encrypted data file which is transferred (by sneaker net?) to the central system.  This must include the ""voting booth"" identity information and a record for each voter including their SSN and the digital key (or signature, or biometric data).  Votes with invalid keys are eliminated.  Multiple votes with the same key and same votes are treated as a single vote for that candidate.  Multiple votes with the same key and different votes are flagged for fraud investigation (with the constituent contacted by phone, issued a new key, and directed to revote).</p>

<ol>
<li>Client computer has a cryptography package.  </li>
<li>Dirty serwer that stores <em>encrypted</em> user input and output</li>
<li>Clean serwer that is not accesible from outside that stores keys and decrypted data. </li>
</ol>

<p>Users are issued cryptography cards (you may want to use something less safe - eg. pgp), and are required by jsp pages to encrypt with them all input. Page contains component that connects to cryctography app, asks user for key passphrase, encrypts it with server public key and signs it with user private key, then submits. </p>

<p>Data is stored in external server then transferred to internal server, where it is decrypted and signature is verified, then data is processed and reencrypted, then it is sent to dirty server, and then user may get it. </p>

<p>So even if someone cracked the dirty server (even get hold of database) he would get mostly useless data. </p>

<p>Can't you just simply reference Java log4j libraries in your own java process?

29564,2,,29505,8/27/2008 5:05,1,,"<p><em>Theoretically</em>, it's possible. The Java Serialization, like pretty much everything in Javaland, is standardized. So, you <em>could</em> implement a deserializer according to that standard in Python. However, the Java Serialization format is not designed for cross-language use, the serialization format is closely tied to the way objects are represented inside the JVM. While implementing a JVM in Python is surely a fun exercise, it's probably not what you're looking for (-:</p>

<p>There are other (data) serialization formats that are specifically designed to be language agnostic. They usually work by stripping the data formats down to the bare minimum (number, string, sequence, dictionary and that's it) and thus requiring a bit of work on both ends to represent a rich object as a graph of dumb data structures (and vice versa).</p>

<p>Two examples are <a href=""http://JSON.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)"">JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</a> and <a href=""http://YAML.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)"">YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""http://ASN1.Elibel.Tm.Fr/en/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One)"">ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One)</a> is another data serialization format. Instead of dumbing the format down to a point where it can be easily understood, ASN.1 is self-describing, meaning all the information needed to decode a stream is encoded within the stream itself.</p>

<p>And, of course, <a href=""http://W3.Org/XML/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""XML (eXtensible Markup Language)"">XML (eXtensible Markup Language)</a>, will work too, provided that it is not just used to provide textual representation of a ""memory dump"" of a Java object, but an actual abstract, language-agnostic encoding.</p>

<p>So, to make a long story short: your best bet is to either try to coerce log4j into logging in one of the above-mentioned formats, replace log4j with something that does that or try to somehow intercept the objects before they are sent over the wire and convert them before leaving Javaland.</p>

<p>Either of these template languages is a great improvement over JSP/JSTL, if you ask me.</p>

1983480,2,,30281,12/31/2009 1:19,6,,"<p>I have used JBoss Seam now for about a year and like it very much over Spring.  Unfortunately, I don't use this at work, more for side projects and personal projects.  For me, it saves me a lot of time developing new projects for clients.  And, one big reason I use it primarily is, the tight integration with each layer and I never get any lazy load errors that I used to get with Spring (even after the filter and other hacks).</p>

<p>An equivalent Spring application would have much more boilerplate code within it to get stuff working.  Spring does not integrate each layer very well, it more or less is a wrapper for a lot of different things, but doesn't glue itself together very well.</p>

<p>The other nice thing I like with Seam is they practice what they preach.  Take a look at their website.  Take a guess what it is running, hmm, a live example of their code.  Seam Wiki, Seam Forums, etc.  If you truly believe in your code, stand behind it.  I would be happy to have their pager 24x7x365, I bet it rarely goes off.</p>

<p>While you write a lot less code, the learning curve is about twice as steep.  The further I get in, the more I understand how to write good code.  I would like to see more comments, but as far as coding style, it is well written.</p>

<p>On the negative side, just as any product you try to market, Seam was years after Spring had already become popular so Spring is by far still more popular.  Search on Indeed and Seam only has a few hits.  If you look on Spring, there are roughly 40k registered users, while Seam has about 7k.</p>

<p>Depends on what is important to you, as a Java developer/engineer/programmer, you should be able to work with both technologies and chances are, you will most likely encounter a Spring application before a Seam one.  Learn both and how to leverage both.  If you use both properly and know the nuances and quirks of each, development becomes much easier whether you're using Spring or Seam.</p>

<p>I don't agree with the statement, ""Seam is the next Struts"".  Struts was a view technology whereas Seam integrates all layers.  I will agree that it is a new concept like Struts and will bring the same impact to the Java community that Struts did.  I don't think we'll see that until Java EE 6 and CDI become more popular, and of course Seam 3 is released.</p>

1172371,2,,30571,7/23/2009 14:58,229,,"<p>If you  always want to use the newest version, Maven has two keywords you can use as an alternative to version ranges. You should use these options with care as you are no longer in control of the plugins/dependencies you are using.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you depend on a plugin or a dependency, you can use the a version value of LATEST or RELEASE. LATEST refers to the latest released or snapshot version of a particular artifact, the most recently deployed artifact in a particular repository. RELEASE refers to the last non-snapshot release in the repository. In general, it is not a best practice to design software which depends on a non-specific version of an artifact. If you are developing software, you might want to use RELEASE or LATEST as a convenience so that you don't have to update version numbers when a new release of a third-party library is released. When you release software, you should always make sure that your project depends on specific versions to reduce the chances of your build or your project being affected by a software release not under your control. Use LATEST and RELEASE with caution, if at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See the <a href=""http://www.sonatype.com/books/maven-book/reference/pom-relationships-sect-pom-syntax.html#pom-relationships-sect-latest-release"">POM Syntax section of the Maven book</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Here's an example illustrating the various options. In the Maven repository, com.foo:my-foo has the following metadata:</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;&lt;metadata&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.foo&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;my-foo&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;2.0.0&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;versioning&gt;
    &lt;release&gt;1.1.1&lt;/release&gt;
    &lt;versions&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;1.0.1&lt;/version&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;1.1&lt;/version&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;1.1.1&lt;/version&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;2.0.0&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/versions&gt;
    &lt;lastUpdated&gt;20090722140000&lt;/lastUpdated&gt;
  &lt;/versioning&gt;
&lt;/metadata&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If a dependency on that artifact is required, you have the following options (other <a href=""http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVEN/Dependency+Mediation+and+Conflict+Resolution#DependencyMediationandConflictResolution-DependencyVersionRanges"">version ranges</a> can be specified of course, just showing the relevant ones here):</p>

<p>Declare an exact version (will always resolve to 1.0.1):</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;version&gt;[1.0.1]&lt;/version&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Declare an explicit version (will always resolve to 1.0.1 unless a collision occurs, when Maven will select a matching version):</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;version&gt;1.0.1&lt;/version&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Declare a version range for all 1.x (will currently resolve to 1.1.1):</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;version&gt;[1.0.0,2.0.0)&lt;/version&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Declare an open-ended version range (will resolve to 2.0.0):</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;version&gt;[1.0.0,)&lt;/version&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Declare the version as LATEST (will resolve to 2.0.0):</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;version&gt;LATEST&lt;/version&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Declare the version as RELEASE (will resolve to 1.1.1):</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;version&gt;RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that by default your own deployments will update the ""latest"" entry in the Maven metadata, but to update the ""release"" entry, you need to activate the ""release-profile"" from the <a href=""http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html"">Maven super POM</a>. You can do this with either ""-Prelease-profile"" or ""-DperformRelease=true""</p>

<hr>

<p>It's worth emphasising that any approach that allows Maven to pick the dependency versions (LATEST, RELEASE, and version ranges) can leave you open to build time issues, as later versions can have different behaviour (for example the dependency plugin has previously switched a default value from true to false, with confusing results).</p>

<p>It is therefore generally a good idea to define exact versions in releases. As <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30571/how-do-i-tell-maven-to-use-the-latest-version-of-a-dependency/1172805#1172805"">Tim's answer</a> points out, the <a href=""http://mojo.codehaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/"">maven-versions-plugin</a> is a handy tool for updating dependency versions, particularly the <a href=""http://mojo.codehaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/use-latest-versions-mojo.html"">versions:use-latest-versions</a> and <a href=""http://mojo.codehaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/use-latest-releases-mojo.html"">versions:use-latest-releases</a> goals.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Versions Plugin has the following goals:
<ul>
<li><strong>versions:display-dependency-updates</strong> scans a project's dependencies and
produces a report of those
dependencies which have newer
versions available.</li>
<li><strong>versions:display-plugin-updates</strong> scans a project's plugins and
produces a report of those plugins
which have newer versions available.</li>
<li><strong>versions:update-parent</strong> updates the parent section of a project so
that it references the newest
available version. For example, if
you use a corporate root POM, this
goal can be helpful if you need to
ensure you are using the latest
version of the corporate root POM.</li>
<li><strong>versions:update-properties</strong> updates properties defined in a
project so that they correspond to
the latest available version of
specific dependencies. This can be
useful if a suite of dependencies
must all be locked to one version.</li>
<li><strong>versions:update-child-modules</strong> updates the parent section of the
child modules of a project so the
version matches the version of the

<p>That is I use the versions plugin and scm plugin to update the dependencies and then check it in to source control. Yes I let my CI do SCM checkins (which you have to do anyway for the maven release plugin).</p>

<p>You'll want to setup the versions plugin to only update what you want:</p>

<p>One more thing: as good as XOM is (wrt alternatives), often Tree Model is not the right thing to use if  you are not dealing with ""document-centric"" xml  (~= xhtml pages, docbook, open office docs).

30720,2,,30696,8/27/2008 17:51,5,,"<p>The literal answer is no - there is never anything ""inherently wrong"" with code, it's a matter of whether it meets the requirements - which may or may not include being maintainable, secure, robust or fast.</p>

<p>The code you are running is actually a JET query purely within Access - the Java code is doing nothing except telling Access to run the query.</p>

<p>On the one hand, if it ain't broke don't fix it. On the other hand, there's a good chance it will break in the near future so you could try fixing it in advance.</p>

<p>The two likely reasons it might break are:</p>

<ol>
<li>SQL injection risk. Depending on where csvDirPath and csvFileName come from (e.g. csvFileName might come from the name of the file uploaded by a user?), and on how clever the Access JDBC driver is, you could be open to someone breaking or deleting your data by inserting a semicolon (or some brackets to make a subquery) and some additional SQL commands into the query.</li>
<li>You are relying on the columns of the CSV file being compatible with the columns of the Access table. If you have unchecked CSV being uploaded, or if the CSV generator has a particular way of handling nulls, or if you one day get an unusual date or number format, you may get an error on inserting into the Access table.</li>
</ol>

<p>Having said all that, we are all about pragmatism here. If the above code is from a utility class which you are going to use by hand a few times a week/month/year/ever, then it isn't really a problem.</p>

<p>If it is a class which forms part of a web application, then the 'official' Java way to do it would be to read records out of the CSV file (either using a CSV parser or a CSV/text JDBC driver), get the columns out of the recordset, do some validation or sanity checking on them, and then use a new PreparedStatement to insert them into the Access database. Much more trouble but much more robust.</p>

<p>You can probably find a combination of tools (e.g. object-relational layers or other data access tools) which will do a lot of that for you, but setting up the tools is going to be as much hassle as writing the code. Then again, you'll learn a lot from either one.</p>

This use to be what I considered object oriented, but really this leads us just to exposing the guts and implementation of the object and not really taking advantage of encapsulation.  There are times you can't get away from this (OR/M comes to mind), but in general the object should be set up and then perform its function.  My dream objects tend to have one or two constructors, and maybe a half dozen functions that do work.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that once I started developing API's there is a real need to keep things simple.

This allows for Template Meta-Programming and makes the C++ compiler equivalent to a Turing machine (i.e. during the compilation process you can compute anything that is computable with a Turing machine).</p>

31758,2,,31693,8/28/2008 7:11,61,,"<p>C++ rarely uses the “generics” terminology. Instead, the word “templates” is used and is more accurate. Templates describes one <em>technique</em> to achieve a generic design.</p>

<p>C++ templates is very different from what both C# and Java implement for two main reasons. The first reason is that C++ templates don't only allow compile-time type arguments but also compile-time const-value arguments: templates can be given as integers or even function signatures. This means that you can do some quite funky stuff at compile time, e.g. calculations:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;unsigned int N&gt;
struct product {
    static unsigned int const VALUE = N * product&lt;N - 1&gt;::VALUE;
};

template &lt;&gt;
struct product&lt;1&gt; {
    static unsigned int const VALUE = 1;
};

// Usage:
unsigned int const p5 = product&lt;5&gt;::VALUE;
</code></pre>

<p>This code also uses the other distinguished feature of C++ templates, namely template specialization. The code defines one class template, <code>product</code> that has one value argument. It also defines a specialization for that template that is used whenever the argument evaluates to 1. This allows me to define a recursion over template definitions. I believe that this was first discovered by <a href=""http://erdani.org/"">Andrei Alexandrescu</a>.</p>

<p>Template specialization is important for C++ because it allows for structural differences in data structures. Templates as a whole is a means of unifying an interface across types. However, although this is desirable, all types cannot be treated equally inside the implementation. C++ templates takes this into account. This is very much the same difference that OOP makes between interface and implementation with the overriding of virtual methods.</p>

<p>C++ templates are essential for its algorithmic programming paradigm. For example, almost all algorithms for containers are defined as functions that accept the container type as a template type and treat them uniformly. Actually, that's not quite right: C++ doesn't work on containers but rather on <em>ranges</em> that are defined by two iterators, pointing to the beginning and behind the end of the container. Thus, the whole content is circumscribed by the iterators: begin &lt;= elements &lt; end.</p>

<p>Using iterators instead of containers is useful because it allows to operate on parts of a container instead of on the whole.</p>

<p>Another distinguishing feature of C++ is the possibility of <em>partial specialization</em> for class templates. This is somewhat related to pattern matching on arguments in Haskell and other functional languages. For example, let's consider a class that stores elements:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;
class Store { … }; // (1)
</code></pre>

<p>This works for any element type. But let's say that we can store pointers more effciently than other types by applying some special trick. We can do this by <em>partially</em> specializing for all pointer types:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;
class Store&lt;T*&gt; { … }; // (2)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, whenever we instance a container template for one type, the appropriate definition is used:</p>

<pre><code>Store&lt;int&gt; x; // Uses (1)
Store&lt;int*&gt; y; // Uses (2)
Store&lt;string**&gt; z; // Uses (2), with T = string*.

<p>Templates are one of the main reasons why C++ fails so abysmally at intellisense, regardless of the IDE used. Because of template specialization, the IDE can never be really sure if a given member exists or not. Consider:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;
struct X {
    void foo() { }
};

template &lt;&gt;
struct X&lt;int&gt; { };

typedef int my_int_type;

X&lt;my_int_type&gt; a;
a.|
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the cursor is at the indicated position and it's damn hard for the IDE to say at that point if, and what, members <code>a</code> has. For other languages the parsing would be straightforward but for C++, quite a bit of evaluation is needed beforehand.</p>

<p>It gets worse. What if <code>my_int_type</code> were defined inside a class template as well? Now its type would depend on another type argument. And here, even compilers fail.</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;
struct Y {
    typedef T my_type;
};

X&lt;Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type&gt; b;
</code></pre>

<p>After a bit of thinking, a programmer would conclude that this code is the same as the above: <code>Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type</code> resolves to <code>int</code>, therefore <code>b</code> should be the same type as <code>a</code>, right?</p>

<p>Wrong. At the point where the compiler tries to resolve this statement, it doesn't actually know <code>Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type</code> yet! Therefore, it doesn't know that this is a type. It could be something else, e.g. a member function or a field. This might give rise to ambiguities (though not in the present case), therefore the compiler fails. We have to tell it explicitly that we refer to a type name:</p>

<pre><code>X&lt;typename Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type&gt; b;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the code compiles. To see how ambiguities arise from this situation, consider the following code:</p>

<pre><code>Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type(123);
</code></pre>

<p>This code statement is perfectly valid and tells C++ to execute the function call to <code>Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type</code>. However, if <code>my_type</code> is not a function but rather a type, this statement would still be valid and perform a special cast (the function-style cast) which is often a constructor invocation. The compiler can't tell which we mean so we have to disambiguate here.</p>

31866,2,,31693,8/28/2008 8:52,6,,"<p>Both Java and C# introduced generics after their first language release.  However, there are differences in how the core libraries changed when generics was introduced.  <strong>C#'s generics are not just compiler magic</strong> and so it was not possible to <em>generify</em> existing library classes without breaking backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>For example, in Java the existing <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/collections/index.html"">Collections Framework</a> was <em>completely genericised</em>.  <strong>Java does not have both a generic and legacy non-generic version of the collections classes.</strong>  In some ways this is much cleaner - if you need to use a collection in C# there is really very little reason to go with the non-generic version, but those legacy classes remain in place, cluttering up the landscape. </p>

<p><strong>Another notable difference is the Enum classes in Java and C#.</strong>  Java's Enum has this somewhat tortuous looking definition:</p>

<pre><code>//  Parsing String to Enum in Java
Colour colour = Colour.valueOf(""RED"");

<p>Compare this to C#'s version:</p>

31929,2,,31693,8/28/2008 9:50,365,,"<p>I'll add my voice to the noise and take a stab at making things clear:</p>

<h2>C# Generics allow you to declare something like this.</h2>

<pre><code>List&lt;Person&gt; foo = new List&lt;Person&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>and then the compiler will prevent you from putting things that aren't <code>Person</code> into the list.<br>
Behind the scenes the C# compiler is just putting <code>List&lt;Person&gt;</code> into the .NET dll file, but at runtime the JIT compiler  goes and builds a new set of code, as if you had written a special list class just for containing people - something like <code>ListOfPerson</code>.</p>

<p>The benefit of this is that it makes it really fast. There's no casting or any other stuff, and because the dll contains the information that this is a List of <code>Person</code>, other code that looks at it later on using reflection can tell that it contains <code>Person</code> objects (so you get intellisense and so on).</p>

<p>The downside of this is that old C# 1.0 and 1.1 code (before they added generics) doesn't understand these new <code>List&lt;something&gt;</code>, so you have to manually convert things back to plain old <code>List</code> to interoperate with them. This is not that big of a problem, because C# 2.0 binary code is not backwards compatible. The only time this will ever happen is if you're upgrading some old C# 1.0/1.1 code to C# 2.0</p>

<h2>Java Generics allow you to declare something like this.</h2>

<pre><code>ArrayList&lt;Person&gt; foo = new ArrayList&lt;Person&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>On the surface it looks the same, and it sort-of is. The compiler will also prevent you from putting things that aren't <code>Person</code> into the list.</p>

<p>The difference is what happens behind the scenes. Unlike C#, Java does not go and build a special <code>ListOfPerson</code> - it just uses the plain old <code>ArrayList</code> which has always been in Java. When you get things out of the array, the usual <code>Person p = (Person)foo.get(1);</code> casting-dance still has to be done. The compiler is saving you the key-presses, but the speed hit/casting is still incurred just like it always was.<br>
When people mention ""Type Erasure"" this is what they're talking about. The compiler inserts the casts for you, and then 'erases' the fact that it's meant to be a list of <code>Person</code> not just <code>Object</code></p>

<p>The benefit of this approach is that old code which doesn't understand generics doesn't have to care. It's still dealing with the same old <code>ArrayList</code> as it always has. This is more important in the java world because they wanted to support compiling code using Java 5 with generics, and having it run on old 1.4 or previous JVM's, which microsoft deliberately decided not to bother with.</p>

<p>The downside is the speed hit I mentioned previously, and also because there is no <code>ListOfPerson</code> pseudo-class or anything like that going into the .class files, code that looks at it later on (with reflection, or if you pull it out of another collection where it's been converted into <code>Object</code> or so on) can't tell in any way that it's meant to be a list containing only <code>Person</code> and not just any other array list.</p>

<h2>C++ Templates allow you to declare something like this</h2>

<pre><code>std::list&lt;Person&gt;* foo = new std::list&lt;Person&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like C# and Java generics, and it will do what you think it should do, but behind the scenes different things are happening.</p>

<p>It has the most in common with C# generics in that it builds special <code>pseudo-classes</code> rather than just throwing the type information away like java does, but it's a whole different kettle of fish.</p>

<p>Both C# and Java produce output which is designed for virtual machines. If you write some code which has a <code>Person</code> class in it, in both cases some information about a <code>Person</code> class will go into the .dll or .class file, and the JVM/CLR will do stuff with this.</p>

<p>C++ produces raw x86 binary code. Everything is <em>not</em> an object, and there's no underlying virtual machine which needs to know about a <code>Person</code> class. There's no boxing or unboxing, and functions don't have to belong to classes, or indeed anything. </p>

<p>Because of this, the C++ compiler places no restrictions on what you can do with templates - basically any code you could write manually, you can get templates to write for you.<br>
The most obvious example is adding things:</p>

<p>In C# and Java, the generics system needs to know what methods are available for a class, and it needs to pass this down to the virtual machine. The only way to tell it this is by either hard-coding the actual class in, or using interfaces. For example:</p>

<pre><code>string addNames&lt;T&gt;( T first, T second ) { return first.Name() + second.Name(); }
</code></pre>

<p>That code won't compile in C# or Java, because it doesn't know that the type <code>T</code> actually provides a method called Name(). You have to tell it - in C# like this:</p>

<pre><code>interface IHasName{ string Name(); };
string addNames&lt;T&gt;( T first, T second ) where T : IHasName { .... }
</code></pre>

<p>And then you have to make sure the things you pass to addNames implement the IHasName interface and so on. The java syntax is different (<code>&lt;T extends IHasName&gt;</code>), but it suffers from the same problems.</p>

<p>The 'classic' case for this problem is trying to write a function which does this</p>

<pre><code>string addNames&lt;T&gt;( T first, T second ) { return first + second; }
</code></pre>

<p>You can't actually write this code because there are no ways to declare an interface with the <code>+</code> method in it. You fail.</p>

<p>C++ suffers from none of these problems. The compiler doesn't care about passing types down to any VM's - if both your objects have a .Name() function, it will compile. If they don't, it won't. Simple.</p>

<p>So, there you have it :-)</p>

33729,2,,31693,8/29/2008 0:57,18,,"<p>There are already a lot of good answers on <em>what</em> the differences are, so let me give a slightly different perspective and add the <em>why</em>.</p>

<p>As was already explained, the main difference is <em>type erasure</em>, i.e. the fact that the Java compiler erases the generic types and they don't end up in the generated bytecode. However, the question is: why would anyone do that? It doesn't make sense! Or does it?</p>

<p>Well, what's the alternative? If you don't implement generics in the language, where <em>do</em> you implement them? And the answer is: in the Virtual Machine. Which breaks backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>Type erasure, on the other hand, allows you to mix generic clients with non-generic libraries. In other words: code that was compiled on Java 5 can still be deployed to Java 1.4.</p>

<p>Microsoft, however, decided to break backwards compatibility for generics. <em>That's</em> why .NET Generics are ""better"" than Java Generics.</p>

<p>Of course, Sun aren't idiots or cowards. The reason why they ""chickened out"", was that Java was significantly older and more widespread than .NET when they introduced generics. (They were introduced roughly at the same time in both worlds.) Breaking backwards compatibility would have been a huge pain.</p>

<p>Put yet another way: in Java, Generics are a part of the <em>Language</em> (which means they apply <em>only</em> to Java, not to other languages), in .NET they are part of the <em>Virtual Machine</em> (which means they apply to <em>all</em> languages, not just C# and Visual Basic.NET).</p>

<p>Compare this with .NET features like LINQ, lambda expressions, local variable type inference, anonymous types and expression trees: these are all <em>language</em> features. That's why there are subtle differences between VB.NET and C#: if those features were part of the VM, they would be the same in <em>all</em> languages. But the CLR hasn't changed: it's still the same in .NET 3.5 SP1 as it was in .NET 2.0. You can compile a C# program that uses LINQ with the .NET 3.5 compiler and still run it on .NET 2.0, provided that you don't use any .NET 3.5 libraries. That would <em>not</em> work with generics and .NET 1.1, but it <em>would</em> work with Java and Java 1.4.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular believe, which I never understand where it came from, .net implemented true generics without breaking backward compatibility, and they spent explicit effort for that.
You don't have to change your non-generic .net 1.0 code into generics just to be used in .net 2.0. Both the generic and non-generic lists are still available in .Net framework 2.0 even until 4.0, exactly for nothing else but backward compatibility reason. Therefore old codes that still used non-generic ArrayList will still work, and use the same ArrayList class as before.
Backward code compatibility is always maintained since 1.0 till now... So even in .net 4.0, you still have to option to use any non-generics class from 1.0 BCL if you choose to do so.</p>

The Model will be stored on a few session level controllers which will handle talking to the back-end (EJBs, or persistence layer) these session controllers should be implementing the business logic and have no knowledge of JSF,HTML or any presentation technology.</p>

Also the integration with WebSphere is pretty good. Unless your employer plays golf with IBM, I think it is better to stay as vanilla as possible.</p>

(You may like to create this executor using <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html""><code>Executors</code></a><code>.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor()</code> for ease of use; it creates something much like a <code>Timer</code>.)</p>

You can use this to cancel the scheduled task. You're then free to submit a new task with a different triggering time.</p>

<p>ETA: The <code>Timer</code> documentation linked to doesn't say anything about <code>ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor</code>, however the <a href=""http://openjdk.java.net/"">OpenJDK</a> version had this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Java 5.0 introduced the <code>java.util.concurrent</code> package and
  one of the concurrency utilities therein is the 
  <code>ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor</code> which is a thread pool for repeatedly
  executing tasks at a given rate or delay.  It is effectively a more
  versatile replacement for the <code>Timer</code>/<code>TimerTask</code>
  combination, as it allows multiple service threads, accepts various
  time units, and doesn't require subclassing <code>TimerTask</code> (just
  implement <code>Runnable</code>).  Configuring
  <code>ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor</code> with one thread makes it equivalent to
  <code>Timer</code>.</p>

<p>But here is another solution to your problem:
In my mind, there are two statements that collide with each other here: ""debug statements"" and ""production code"". </p>

<p>What is the purpose of debug statements? Help to get rid of bugs while (unit) testing. If a piece of software is properly tested and works according to the requirements, debug statements are nothing else but OBSOLETE.</p>

<p>I strongly disagree with leaving any debug statements in production code. I bet nobody bothers testing side-effects of debug code in production code. The code probably does what it's supposed to do, but does it do more than that? Do all your #defines work correctly and really take ALL of the debug code out? Who analyzes 100000 lines of pre-processed code to see if all the debug stuff is gone?</p>

<p>Unless we have a different definition of production code, you should consider taking out the debug statements after the code is tested and be done with it.</p>

32122,2,,32041,8/28/2008 12:46,16,,"<p>Two recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>First:</strong>
for real logging, use a modern logging package like log4j or java's own built in logging. Don't worry about performance so much, the logging level check is on the order of nanoseconds. (it's an integer comparison).</p>

<p>And if you have more than a single log statement, guard the whole block:</p>

<p>(log4j, for example:)</p>

<pre><code>if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {

  // perform expensive operations
  // build string to log

  logger.debug(""...."");
}
</code></pre>

<p>This gives you the added ability control logging at runtime. Having to restart and run a debug build can be very inconvenient.</p>

<p><strong>Second:</strong></p>

<p>You may find <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/lang/assert.html"">assertions</a> are more what you need. An assertion is a statement which evaluates to a boolean result, with an optional message:</p>

<pre><code> assert (sky.state != FALLING) : ""The sky is falling!"";
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever the assertion results in a false, the assertion fails and an AssertionError is thrown containing your message (this is an unchecked exception, intended to exit the application). </p>

<p>The neat thing is, these are treated special by the JVM and can toggled at runtime down to the class level, using a VM parameter (no recompile needed). If not enabled, there is zero overhead.</p>

32342,2,,32041,8/28/2008 14:11,0,,"<p>I would also highly recommend using a logging framework.</p>

<p>The <code>logger.IsDebugEnabled()</code> is not mandatory, it is just that it can be faster to check whether the system is in the debug level before logging.</p>

<p>Using a logging framework means you can configure logging levels on the fly without restarting the application.</p>

logger.debug(""Something bad happend with loads more detail"")

<p>When something like that isn't available, I generally test non-private methods with a run-time null-check, and assertions for internal methods.  Rather than code the null check explicitly in each method, I delegate that to a utilities class with a check null method:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Checks to see if an object is null, and if so 
 * generates an IllegalArgumentException with a fitting message.
 * 
 * @param o The object to check against null.
 * @param name The name of the object, used to format the exception message
 *
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if o is null.
 */
public static void checkNull(Object o, String name) 
    throws IllegalArgumentException {
   if (null == o)
      throw new IllegalArgumentException(name + "" must not be null"");
}

public static void checkNull(Object o) throws IllegalArgumentException {
   checkNull(o, ""object"");
} 

// untested:
public static void checkNull(Object... os) throws IllegalArgumentException {
   for(Object o in os) checkNull(o);  
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then checking turns into:</p>

<pre><code>public void someFun(String val1, String val2) throws IllegalArgumentException {
   ExceptionUtilities.checkNull(val1, ""val1"");
   ExceptionUtilities.checkNull(val2, ""val2"");

   /** alternatively:
   ExceptionUtilities.checkNull(val1, val2);
   **/

   /** ... **/
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>That</em> can be added with editor macros, or a code-processing script.
<strong>Edit:</strong> The verbose check could be added this way as well, but I think it's significantly easier to automate the addition of a single line.</p>

<p>One should always be careful with Runtime Exceptions - exceptions that are not declared on the method signature. Since the compiler doesn't enforce you to catch these it's really easy to forget about them. Make sure you have some kind of a ""catch all"" exception handling to prevent the software to halt abruptly. That's the most important part of your user experience.</p>

Ultimately, the asserts are going to end up giving a <em>similar</em> experience to the end user but provide no way for the developer calling your code to handle the situation before showing an exception to the end user.

33552,2,,32280,8/28/2008 22:26,2,,"<p>Both the use of assertions and the throwing of exceptions are valid approaches here.  Either mechanism can be used to indicate a programming error, not a runtime error, as is the case here.</p>

<ul>
<li>Assertions have the advantage of performance as they are typically disabled on production systems.  </li>
<li>Exceptions have the advantage of safety, as the check is always performed.  </li>
</ul>

<p>The choice really depends on the development practices of the project.  The project as a whole needs to decide on an assertion policy: if the choice is to enable assertions during all development, then I'd say to use assertions to check this kind of invalid parameter - in a production system, a NullPointerException thrown due to a programming error is unlikely to be able to be caught and handled in a meaningful way anyway and so will act just like an assertion.</p>

<p>Practically though, I know a lot of developers that don't trust that assertions will be enabled when appropriate and so opt for the safety of throwing a NullPointerException.</p>

<p>Of course if you can't enforce a policy for your code (if you're creating a library, for example, and so are dependent on how other developers run your code), you should opt for the safe approach of throwing NullPointerException for those methods that are part of the library's API.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>then you should throw System.ArgumentNullException</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't see how throwing a .net framework exception is going to help him :)</p>

<p>Otherwise, in a Java way, assuming the null comes from a programming error (ie. should never go outside the testing phase), then leave the system throw it, or if there are side-effects reaching that point, check for null at the beginning and throw either IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException.</p>

<p>If the null could come from an actual <em>exception</em>al case but you don't want to use a checked exception for that, then you definitely want to go the IllegalArgumentException route at the beginning of the method.</p>

One reason is that calling System.exit makes your code difficult to use if you want other code to be able to use it.  For example, if you find out that your class would be useful from a web app, or some kind of message consuming app, it would be nice to allow those containers the opportunity to deal with the failure somehow.  A container may want to retry the operation, decide to log and ignore the problem, send an email to an administrator, etc.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>When setting cookies in your app, use</p>

<pre><code>response.setHeader( ""Set-Cookie"", ""name=value; HttpOnly"");
</code></pre>

<p>However, in many webapps, the most important cookie is the session identifier, which is automatically set by the container as the JSESSIONID cookie.</p>

<p>If you only use this cookie, you can write a ServletFilter to re-set the cookies on the way out, forcing JSESSIONID to HttpOnly. The page at <strike>http://keepitlocked.net/archive/2007/11/05/java-and-httponly.aspx</strike> <a href=""http://alexsmolen.com/blog/?p=16"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alexsmolen.com/blog/?p=16</a> suggests adding the following in a filter.</p>

<pre><code>if (response.containsHeader( ""SET-COOKIE"" )) {
  String sessionid = request.getSession().getId();
  response.setHeader( ""SET-COOKIE"", ""JSESSIONID="" + sessionid 
                      + "";Path=/&lt;whatever&gt;; Secure; HttpOnly"" );
} 
</code></pre>

<p>but note that this will overwrite all cookies and only set what you state here in this filter. </p>

<p>If you use additional cookies to the JSESSIONID cookie, then you'll need to extend this code to set all the cookies in the filter. This is not a great solution in the case of multiple-cookies, but is a perhaps an acceptable quick-fix for the JSESSIONID-only setup. </p>

<p>Please note that as your code evolves over time, there's a nasty hidden bug waiting for you when you forget about this filter and try and set another cookie somewhere else in your code. Of course, it won't get set.</p>

<p>This really is a hack though. If you do use Tomcat and can compile it, then take a look at Shabaz's excellent suggestion to patch HttpOnly support into Tomcat.</p>

<p>For most of the applications I work on, I would not consider this approach; I would use an import/export mechanism to convert from a real database (even if it's an in-process database like Berkeley DB or Derby) to the text files. Yes, it's an extra step, but it could be automated, and the performance isn't likely to be much worse than trying to use the text files directly (it will likely be much better, overall), and it will be more robust and easy to develop.</p>

<p>The steps are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Restore View</strong>. The UIComponent tree is rebuilt.</li>
<li><strong>Apply Request Values</strong>. Editable components should implement EditableValueHolder. This phase walks the component tree and calls the <em>processDecodes</em> methods. If the component isn't something complex like a UIData, it won't do much except call its own <em>decode</em> method. The <em>decode</em> method doesn't do much except find its renderer and invokes its <em>decode</em> method, passing itself as an argument. It is the renderer's job to get any submitted value and set it via <em>setSubmittedValue</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Process Validations</strong>. This phase calls <em>processValidators</em> which will call <em>validate</em>. The <em>validate</em> method takes the submitted value, converts it with any converters, validates it with any validators and (assuming the data passes those tests) calls <em>setValue</em>. This will store the value as a local variable. While this local variable is not null, it will be returned and not the value from the value binding for any calls to <em>getValue</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Update Model Values</strong>. This phase calls <em>processUpdates</em>. In an input component, this will call <em>updateModel</em> which will get the <em>ValueExpression</em> and invoke it to set the value on the model.</li>
<li><strong>Invoke Application</strong>. Button event listeners and so on will be invoked here (as will navigation if memory serves).</li>
<li><strong>Render Response</strong>. The tree is rendered via the renderers and the state saved.</li>
<li>If any of these phases fail (e.g. a value is invalid), the lifecycle skips to Render Response.</li>
<li>Various events can be fired after most of these phases, invoking listeners as appropriate (like value change listeners after Process Validations).</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a somewhat simplified version of events. Refer to the specification for more details.</p>

<p>I would question why you are writing your own UIComponent. This is a non-trivial task and a deep understanding of the JSF architecture is required to get it right. If you need a custom control, it is better to create a concrete control that extends an exisiting UIComponent (like HtmlInputText does) with an equivalent renderer.</p>

<p>Some of the design decisions behind JSF start to make a little more sense when you consider the goals. JSF was designed to be tooled - it exposes lots of metadata for IDEs.

<p>Of that, I think the only part that I agree with is the ""a little more sense"".  The metadata could have been exposed in other ways in JSF 1.2, and frankly, I have yet to see an IDE make decent use of it.  Why can't an IDE give me a simple way to build a component?</p>

33564,2,,33497,8/28/2008 22:32,15,,"<p>IMO, wrapping exceptions (checked or otherwise) has several benefits that are worth the cost:</p>

<p>1) It encourages you to think about the failure modes for the code you write. Basically, you have to consider the exceptions that the code you call may throw, and in turn you'll consider the exceptions you'll throw for the code that calls yours.</p>

<p>2) It gives you the opportunity to add additional debugging information into the exception chain. For instance, if you have a method that throws an exception on a duplicate username, you might wrap that exception with one that includes additional information about the circumstances of the failure (for example, the IP of the request that provided the dupe username) that wasn't available to the lower-level code. The cookie trail of exceptions may help you debug a complex problem (it certainly has for me).</p>

<p>3) It lets you become implementation-independent from the lower level code. If you're wrapping exceptions and need to swap out Hibernate for some other ORM, you only have to change your Hibernate-handling code. All the other layers of code will still be successfully using the wrapped exceptions and will interpret them in the same way, even though the underlying circumstances have changed. Note that this applies even if Hibernate changes in some way (ex: they switch exceptions in a new version); it's not just for wholesale technology replacement.</p>

<p>4) It encourages you use different classes of exceptions to represent different situations. For example, you may have a DuplicateUsernameException when the user tries to reuse a username, and a DatabaseFailureException when you can't check for dupe usernames due to a broken DB connection. This, in turn, lets you answer your question (""how do I recover?"") in flexible and powerful ways. If you get a DuplicateUsernameException, you may decide to suggest a different username to the user. If you get a DatabaseFailureException, you may let it bubble up to the point where it displays a ""down for maintenance"" page to the user and send off a notification email to you. Once you have custom exceptions, you have customizeable responses -- and that's a good thing.</p>

Management of Errors</a></p>

<p>From the Split Domain and Technical Errors pattern</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A technical error should never cause a
  domain error to be generated (never
  the twain should meet). When a
  technical error must cause business
  processing to fail, it should be
  wrapped as a SystemError. </p>
  
  <p>Domain errors should always start from a
  domain problem and be handled by
  domain code. </p>
  
  <p>Domain errors should
  pass ""seamlessly"" through technical
  boundaries. It may be that such errors
  must be serialized and re-constituted
  for this to happen. Proxies and
  facades should take responsibility for
  doing this. </p>
  
  <p>Technical errors should
  be handled in particular points in the
  application, such as boundaries (see
  Log at Distribution Boundary). </p>
  
  <p>The
  amount of context information passed
  back with the error will depend on how
  useful this will be for subsequent
  diagnosis and handling (figuring out
  an alternative strategy). You need to
  question whether the stack trace from
  a remote machine is wholly useful to
  the processing of a domain error
  (although the code location of the
  error and variable values at that time
  may be useful)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, wrap the hibernate exception at the boundary to hibernate with an unchecked domain exception such as a ""UniqueUsernameException"", and let that bubble up all the way to the handler of it.  Make sure to javadoc the thrown exception even though it isn't a checked exception!</p>

When you've got all of the hits, divide the size of the set into the number of ranges you want (five to seven is a good number according the user interface guys), and rather than a single-valued constraint, your facets will be a range query with the lower and upper bounds of each of those subsets.</p>

<p>Here are some discussions on the topic:</p>

11329853,2,,33956,7/4/2012 13:14,2,,"<p>I have worked out how to calculate sensible dynamic facets for product price ranges.  The solution involves some pre-processing of documents and some post-processing of the query results, but it requires only one query to Solr, and should even work on old version of Solr like 1.4.</p>

<h1>Round up prices before submission</h1>

<p>First, before submitting the document, <strong>round up</strong> the the price to the nearest ""nice round facet boundary"" and store it in a ""rounded_price"" field.  Users like their facets to look like ""250-500"" not ""247-483"", and rounding also means you get back hundreds of price facets not millions of them.  With some effort the following code can be generalised to round nicely at any price scale:</p>

<pre><code>    public static decimal RoundPrice(decimal price)
    {
        if (price &lt; 25)
            return Math.Ceiling(price);
        else if (price &lt; 100)
            return Math.Ceiling(price / 5) * 5;
        else if (price &lt; 250)
            return Math.Ceiling(price / 10) * 10;
        else if (price &lt; 1000)
            return Math.Ceiling(price / 25) * 25;
        else if (price &lt; 2500)
            return Math.Ceiling(price / 100) * 100;
        else if (price &lt; 10000)
            return Math.Ceiling(price / 250) * 250;
        else if (price &lt; 25000)
            return Math.Ceiling(price / 1000) * 1000;
        else if (price &lt; 100000)
            return Math.Ceiling(price / 2500) * 2500;
        else
            return Math.Ceiling(price / 5000) * 5000;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Permissible prices go 1,2,3,...,24,25,30,35,...,95,100,110,...,240,250,275,300,325,...,975,1000 and so forth.  </p>

<h1>Get all facets on rounded prices</h1>

<p>Second, when submitting the query, request all facets on rounded prices sorted by price: <code>facet.field=rounded_price</code>.  Thanks to the rounding, you'll get at most a few hundred facets back.</p>

<h1>Combine adjacent facets into larger facets</h1>

<p>Third, after you have the results, the user wants see only 3 to 7 facets, not hundreds of facets.  So, combine adjacent facets into a few large facets (called ""segments"") trying to get a roughly equal number of documents in each segment. The following rather more complicated code does this, returning tuples of (start, end, count) suitable for performing range queries.  The counts returned will be correct provided prices were been rounded <em>up</em> to the nearest boundary:</p>

<pre><code>    public static List&lt;Tuple&lt;string, string, int&gt;&gt; CombinePriceFacets(int nSegments, ICollection&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;string, int&gt;&gt; prices)
    {
        var ranges = new List&lt;Tuple&lt;string, string, int&gt;&gt;();
        int productCount = prices.Sum(p =&gt; p.Value);
        int productsRemaining = productCount;
        if (nSegments &lt; 2)
            return ranges;
        int segmentSize = productCount / nSegments;
        string start = ""*"";
        string end = ""0"";
        int count = 0;
        int totalCount = 0;
        int segmentIdx = 1;
        foreach (KeyValuePair&lt;string, int&gt; price in prices)
        {
            end = price.Key;
            count += price.Value;
            totalCount += price.Value;
            productsRemaining -= price.Value;
            if (totalCount &gt;= segmentSize * segmentIdx)
            {
                ranges.Add(new Tuple&lt;string, string, int&gt;(start, end, count));
                start = end;
                count = 0;
                segmentIdx += 1;
            }
            if (segmentIdx == nSegments)
            {
                ranges.Add(new Tuple&lt;string, string, int&gt;(start, ""*"", count + productsRemaining));
                break;
            }
        }
        return ranges;
    }
</code></pre>

<h1>Filter results by selected facet</h1> 

<p>Fourth, suppose (""250"",""500"",38) was one of the resulting segments.  If the user selects ""$250 to $500"" as a filter, simply do a filter query <code>fq=price:[250 TO 500]</code></p>

However, if you're looking for an alternative to using reflection, and have access to the source you're testing, this will still be an option.</p>

<p>There is possible merit in testing private methods of a class, particularly with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"">test driven development</a>, where you would like to design small tests before you write any code. </p>

<p>Creating a test with access to private members and methods can test areas of code which are difficult to target specifically with access only to public methods. If a public method has several steps involved, it can consist of several private methods, which can then be tested individually. </p>

<p>Advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>can test to a finer granularity</li>
</ul>

<p>Disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>test code must reside in the same
file as source code, which can be
more difficult to maintain</li>
<li>similarly with .class output files, they must remain within the same package as declared in source code</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if continuous testing requires this method, it may be a signal that the private methods should be extracted, which could be tested in the traditional, public way.</p>

<p>Here is a convoluted example of how this would work:</p>

<pre><code>// import statements and package declarations

public class ClassToTest 
{
    private int decrement(int toDecrement) {
    	toDecrement--;
    	return toDecrement;
    }

    // constructor and rest of class

    public static class StaticInnerTest extends TestCase
    {
    	public StaticInnerTest(){
    		super();
    	}

    	public void testDecrement(){
    		int number = 10;
    		ClassToTest toTest= new ClassToTest();
    		int decremented = toTest.decrement(number);
    		assertEquals(9, decremented);
    	}

    	public static void main(String[] args) {
    		junit.textui.TestRunner.run(StaticInnerTest.class);
    	}

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Inner class would be compiled to <code>ClassToTest$StaticInnerTest</code>.</p>

This doesn't have to change the public interface of the original class, it can internally create an instance of the helper class and call the helper method.</p>

<p>If you want to test difficult error conditions coming from the helper method, you can go a step further. Extract an interface from the helper class, add a public getter and setter to the original class to inject the helper class (used through its interface), and then inject a mock version of the helper class into the original class to test how the original class responds to exceptions from the helper. This approach is also helpful if you want to test the original class without also testing the helper class.</p>

What you <em>should</em> be testing is the public contract that the class has with other objects; you should never directly test an object's internals. If another developer wants to make a small internal change to the class, which doesn't affect the classes public contract, he/she then has to modify your reflection based test to ensure that it works.

<p>Today, I pushed a library to help testing private methods and fields.It has been designed with Android in mind but can really be used for any Java project.</p>

<p>If you got some code with private methods or fields or constructors, you can use <a href=""https://github.com/stephanenicolas/boundbox"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>BoundBox</strong></a>. It does exactly what you are looking for.
Here below is an example of a test that accesses 2 private fields of an Android activity to test it : </p>

<pre><code>@UiThreadTest
public void testCompute() {
    // given
    boundBoxOfMainActivity = new BoundBoxOfMainActivity(getActivity());

    // when
    boundBoxOfMainActivity.boundBox_getButtonMain().performClick();

    // then
    assertEquals(""42"", boundBoxOfMainActivity.boundBox_getTextViewMain().getText());
}

<p><strong>BoundBox</strong> makes it easy to test private/protected fields, methods and constructors. You can even access stuff that is hidden by inheritance. Indeed, BoundBox breaks encapsulation. It will give you access to all that through reflection, <strong>BUT</strong> every thing is checked at compile time.</p>

<p>I personally believe it is better to create classes using TDD; creating the public method stubs, then generating unit tests with <strong>all</strong> the assertions defined in advance, so the expected outcome of the method is determined before you code it. This way, you don't go down the wrong path of making the unit test assertions fit the results. Your class is then robust and meets requirements when all your unit tests pass.</p>

<p>In listening for size changes, note that we ignore any resize events where the width stays the same.  This is because changes in the height of the content do not affect the <i>minimum</i> height of the content, as long as the width is the same.</p>

<p>@travis - interesting idea.  Not sure if it will work for what I need but I'll keep it in mind.  I'm hoping to find something to integrate with the existing site instead of having to go out to a third party.  It would also require me to setup a bittorrent tracker which wouldn't be as easy as it sounds for this application because different users will have different access to different files.</p>

<p>Another tip: You can boost download times even more if you increase the size of the TCP Window on the client's NIC configuration.  Set it as high as the OS allows and you should see up to 2x improvement depending on your physical network.  This worked for me on Windows 2000 and 2003 when FTPing over a WAN.  The down side is it may increase overhead for all other network traffic that wants only a few KB for a network packet, but is now forced to send/recv in 64KB packets.  Your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>Edit: What exactly is this you're trying to accomplish?  Who is the audience?  I'm assumed for a bit that you're looking to do this over your own network; but you seem to imply the client side is someone on the internet.  I think we need clearer requirements.</p>

<li>encoding and decoding work regardless if your class implements Serializable or not</li>
<li>transient modifiers are not taken into account</li>
<li>works only for public classes, that have public constructors</li>

  public int getNumber1() { return number1; }

  public int getNumber2() {return number2;}

fe.setNumber2(13);

<li>You cannot get <code>tool.jar</code> from Maven repo; configure it with Maven is a bit tricky</li>
<li>The <code>tool.jar</code> probably contains platform dependent (native?) code so it is not easily

<li>It runs under assumption that all (local) running JVM apps are ""monitorable"". It looks like
 that from Java 6 all apps generally are (unless you actively configure opposite)</li>

498329,2,,36347,1/31/2009 5:22,55,,"<p>Java Generics are <strong>massively</strong> different to C++ templates.</p>

<p>Basically in C++ templates are basically a glorified preprocessor/macro set (<strong>Note:</strong> since some people seem unable to comprehend an analogy, I'm not saying template processing is a macro).  In Java they are basically syntactic sugar to minimize boilerplate casting of Objects.  Here is a pretty decent <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20090323084529/http://www.mindview.net/WebLog/log-0061"">introduction to C++ templates vs Java generics</a>.</p>

<p>To elaborate on this point: when you use a C++ template, you're basically creating another copy of the code, just as if you used a <code>#define</code> macro.  This allows you to do things like have <code>int</code> parameters in template definitions that determine sizes of arrays and such.</p>

<p>Java doesn't work like that.  In Java all objects extent from <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html"">java.lang.Object</a> so, pre-Generics, you'd write code like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class PhoneNumbers {
  private Map phoneNumbers = new HashMap();

  public String getPhoneNumber(String name) {
    return (String)phoneNumbers.get(name);
  }

  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>because all the Java collection types used Object as their base type so you could put anything in them.  Java 5 rolls around and adds generics so you can do things like:</p>

<pre><code>public class PhoneNumbers {
  private Map&lt;String, String&gt; phoneNumbers = new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;();

  public String getPhoneNumber(String name) {
    return phoneNumbers.get(name);
  }

  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>And that's all Java Generics are: wrappers for casting objects.  That's because Java Generics aren't reified.  They use type erasure.  This decision was made because Java Generics came along so late in the piece that they didn't want to break backward compatibility (a <code>Map&lt;String, String&gt;</code> is usable whenever a <code>Map</code> is called for).  Compare this to .Net/C# where type erasure isn't used, which leads to all sorts of differences (eg you can use primitive types and <code>IEnumerable</code> and <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> bear no relation to each other).</p>

<p>And a class using generics compiled with a Java 5+ compiler is usable no JDK 1.4 (assuming it doesn't use any ohter features or classes that require Java 5+).</p>

<p>That's why Java Generics are called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar"">syntactic sugar</a>.</p>

<p>But this decision on how to do generics has profound effects so much so that the (superb) <a href=""http://www.angelikalanger.com/GenericsFAQ/JavaGenericsFAQ.html"">Java Generics FAQ</a> has sprung up to answer the many, many questions people have about Java Generics.</p>

<p>C++ templates have a number of features that Java Generics don't:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use of primitive type arguments.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;class T, int i&gt;
class Matrix {
  int T[i][i];
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Use of <a href=""http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc/language/ref/default_args_for_templ_params.htm"">default type arguments</a>, which is one feature I miss in Java but there are backwards compatibility reasons for this;</li>
<li>C++ allows the use of primitive type arguments, Java doesn't; and</li>
<li>Java allows bounding of arguments.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>public class ObservableList&lt;T extends List&gt; {
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>It really does need to be stressed that template invocations with different arguments really are different types.  They don't even share static members.  In Java this is not the case.</p>

<p>Aside from the differences with generics, for completeness, here is a <a href=""http://www.javacoffeebreak.com/articles/thinkinginjava/comparingc++andjava.html"">basic comparison of C++ and Java</a> (and <a href=""http://triton.towson.edu/~mzimand/os/Lect2-java-tutorial.html"">another one</a>).</p>

<p>And I can also suggest <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0131872486"">Thinking in Java</a>.  As a C++ programmer a lot of the concepts like objects will be second nature already but there are subtle differences so it can be worthwhile to have an introductory text even if you skim parts.</p>

<p>A lot of what you'll learn when laerning Java is all the libraries (both standard--what comes in the JDK--and nonstandard, which includes commonly used things like Spring).  Java syntax is more verbose than C++ syntax and doesn't have a lot of C++ features (eg operator overloading, mutliple inheritance, the destructor mechanism, etc) but that doesn't strictly make it a subset of C++ either.</p>

<p>It gets bad when that object is an important part of the internal state of another, you've just exposed internal implementation. To prevent this, a copy of the object must be returned instead. This works, but can cause massive GC pressure from tons of single-use copies created.</p>

<p>If you have public fields, consider making the class read-only. Add the fields as parameters to the constructor, and mark the fields final. Otherwise make sure you're not exposing internal state, and if you need to construct new instances for a return value, make sure it won't be called excessively.</p>

<p>See: ""<a href=""http://java.sun.com/docs/books/effective/"">Effective Java</a>"" by Joshua Bloch -- Item #13: Favor Immutability.</p>

<p>PS: Also keep in mind, all JVMs these days will optimize away the getMethod if possible, resulting in just a single field-read instruction. </p>

<li>Just about any automated tool in the java world relies on the getter/setter convention. Ditto for, as noted by others, jsp tags, spring configuration, eclipse tools, etc. etc... 
Fighting against what your tools expect to see is a recipe for long sessions trolling through google trying to find that non-standard way of initiating spring beans. Really not worth the trouble.</li>
<li>Once you have your elegantly coded application with hundreds of public variables you will likely find at least one situation where they're insufficient- where you absolutely need immutability, or you need to trigger some event when the variable gets set, or you want to throw an exception on a variable change because it sets an object state to something unpleasant. You're then stuck with the unenviable choices between  cluttering up your code with some special method everywhere the variable is directly referenced, having some special access form for 3 out of the 1000 variables in your application. </li>

<p>In C++ the object life time only begins when the constructor finishes (although member variables and base classes are fully constructed before it starts). This explains the behaviour when virtual functions are called and also why the destructor isn't run if there's an exception in the constructor's body.</p>

<p>The problem with the Java/.Net definition of object lifetime is that it's harder to make sure the object always meets its invariant without having to put in special cases for when the object is initialized but the constructor hasn't run.

<p>Another point against C++ is that the behavior is much less efficient. Although the constructor knows directly what it calls, the vtab pointer has to be changed for every single class from base to final, because the constructor might call other methods that will call virtual functions. From my experience this wastes far more time than is saved by making virtual functions calls in the constructor more efficient.</p>

  <p>The notify() method is generally used
  for <strong>resource pools</strong>, where there
  are an arbitrary number of ""consumers""
  or ""workers"" that take resources, but
  when a resource is added to the pool,
  only one of the waiting consumers or
  workers can deal with it. The
  notifyAll() method is actually used in
  most other cases. Strictly, it is
  required to notify waiters of a
  condition that could allow multiple
  waiters to proceed. But this is often
  difficult to know. So as a general
  rule, <strong>if you have no particular
  logic for using notify(), then you
  should probably use notifyAll()</strong>,
  because it is often difficult to know
  exactly what threads will be waiting
  on a particular object and why.</p>

37046,2,,37026,8/31/2008 19:25,87,,"<p>Simply put, it depends on why your threads are waiting to be notified. Do you want to tell one of the waiting threads that something happened, or do you want to tell all of them at the same time?</p>

<p>In some cases, all waiting threads can take useful action once the wait finishes. An example would be a set of threads waiting for a certain task to finish; once the task has finished, all waiting threads can continue with their business. In such a case you would use <b>notifyAll()</b> to wake up all waiting threads at the same time.</p>

<p>Another case, for example mutually exclusive locking, only one of the waiting threads can do something useful after being notified (in this case acquire the lock). In such a case, you would rather use <b>notify()</b>. Properly implemented, you <i>could</i> use <b>notifyAll()</b> in this situation as well, but you would unnecessarily wake threads that can't do anything anyway.</p>

3186336,2,,37026,7/6/2010 12:58,115,,"<p>Clearly, <code>notify</code> wakes (any) one thread in the wait set, <code>notifyAll</code> wakes all threads in the waiting set. The following discussion should clear up any doubts. <code>notifyAll</code> should be used most of the time. If you are not sure which to use, then use <code>notifyAll</code>.Please see explanation that follows.</p>

<p>Read very carefully and understand. Please send me an email if you have any questions.</p>

<p>Look at producer/consumer (assumption is a ProducerConsumer class with two methods). IT IS BROKEN (because it uses <code>notify</code>) - yes it MAY work - even most of the time, but it may also cause deadlock - we will see why:</p>

<pre><code>public synchronized void put(Object o) {
    while (buf.size()==MAX_SIZE) {
        wait(); // called if the buffer is full (try/catch removed for brevity)
    }
    buf.add(o);
    notify(); // called in case there are any getters or putters waiting
}

public synchronized Object get() {
    // Y: this is where C2 tries to acquire the lock (i.e. at the beginning of the method)
    while (buf.size()==0) {
        wait(); // called if the buffer is empty (try/catch removed for brevity)
        // X: this is where C1 tries to re-acquire the lock (see below)
    }
    Object o = buf.remove(0);
    notify(); // called if there are any getters or putters waiting
    return o;
}
</code></pre>

<p>FIRSTLY,</p>

<p><strong>Why do we need a while loop surrounding the wait?</strong></p>

<p>We need a <code>while</code> loop in case we get this situation:</p>

<p>Consumer 1 (C1) enter the synchronized block and the buffer is empty, so C1 is put in the wait set (via the <code>wait</code> call). Consumer 2 (C2) is about to enter the synchronized method (at point Y above), but Producer P1 puts an object in the buffer, and subsequently calls <code>notify</code>. The only waiting thread is C1, so it is woken and now attempts to re-acquire the object lock at point X (above).</p>

<p>Now C1 and C2 are attempting to acquire the synchronization lock. One of them (nondeterministically) is chosen and enters the method, the other is blocked (not waiting - but blocked, trying to acquire the lock on the method). Let's say C2 gets the lock first. C1 is still blocking (trying to acquire the lock at X). C2 completes the method and releases the lock. Now, C1 acquires the lock. Guess what, lucky we have a <code>while</code> loop, because, C1 performs the loop check (guard) and is prevented from removing a non-existent element from the buffer (C2 already got it!). If we didn't have a <code>while</code>, we would get an <code>IndexArrayOutOfBoundsException</code> as C1 tries to remove the first element from the buffer!</p>

<p>NOW,</p>

<p><strong>Ok, now why do we need notifyAll?</strong></p>

<p>In the producer/consumer example above it looks like we can get away with <code>notify</code>. It seems this way, because we can prove that the guards on the <em>wait</em> loops for producer and consumer are mutually exclusive. That is, it looks like we cannot have a thread waiting in the <code>put</code> method as well as the <code>get</code> method, because, for that to be true, then the following would have to be true:</p>

<p><code>buf.size() == 0 AND buf.size() == MAX_SIZE</code> (assume MAX_SIZE is not 0)</p>

<p>HOWEVER, this is not good enough, we NEED to use <code>notifyAll</code>. Let's see why ...</p>

<p>Assume we have a buffer of size 1 (to make the example easy to follow). The following steps lead us to deadlock. Note that ANYTIME a thread is woken with notify, it can be non-deterministically selected by the JVM - that is any waiting thread can be woken. Also note that when multiple threads are blocking on entry to a method (i.e. trying to acquire a lock), the order of acquisition can be non-deterministic. Remember also that a thread can only be in one of the methods at any one time - the synchronized methods allow only one thread to be executing (i.e. holding the lock of) any (synchronized) methods in the class. If the following sequence of events occurs - deadlock results:</p>

<p><strong>STEP 1:</strong><BR>
- P1 puts 1 char into the buffer</p>

<p><strong>STEP 2:</strong><BR>
- P2 attempts <code>put</code> - checks wait loop - already a char - waits</p>

<p><strong>STEP 3:</strong><BR>
- P3 attempts <code>put</code> - checks wait loop - already a char - waits</p>

<p><strong>STEP 4:</strong><BR>
- C1 attempts to get 1 char <BR>
- C2 attempts to get 1 char - blocks on entry to the <code>get</code> method<BR>
- C3 attempts to get 1 char - blocks on entry to the <code>get</code> method</p>

<p><strong>STEP 5:</strong><BR>
- C1 is executing the <code>get</code> method - gets the char, calls <code>notify</code>, exits method<BR>
- The <code>notify</code> wakes up P2<BR>
- BUT, C2 enters method before P2 can (P2 must reacquire the lock), so P2 blocks on entry to the <code>put</code> method<BR>
- C2 checks wait loop, no more chars in buffer, so waits<BR>
- C3 enters method after C2, but before P2, checks wait loop, no more chars in buffer, so waits</p>

<p><strong>STEP 6:</strong><BR>
- NOW: there is P3, C2, and C3 waiting!<BR>
- Finally P2 acquires the lock, puts a char in the buffer, calls notify, exits method</p>

<p><strong>STEP 7:</strong><BR>
- P2's notification wakes P3 (remember any thread can be woken)<BR>
- P3 checks the wait loop condition, there is already a char in the buffer, so waits.<BR>
- NO MORE THREADS TO CALL NOTIFY and THREE THREADS PERMANENTLY SUSPENDED!</p>

<p>SOLUTION: Replace <code>notify</code> with <code>notifyAll</code> in the producer/consumer code (above).</p>

multiple dequeuers (2. above) can wait for the condition ""the queue is not empty""

<p>You can easily write an interleaving of operations in which, starting from an empty queue, 2 enqueuers and 2 dequeuers interact and 1 enqueuer will remain sleeping.</p>

17158435,2,,37026,6/17/2013 23:23,1,,"<p><code>notify()</code> lets you write more efficient code than <code>notifyAll()</code>.</p>

<p>Consider the following piece of code that's executed from multiple parallel threads:
</p>

<pre><code>synchronized(this) {
    while(busy) // a loop is necessary here
        wait();
    busy = true;
}
...
synchronized(this) {
    busy = false;
    notifyAll();
}
</code></pre>

<p>It can be made more efficient by using <code>notify()</code>:
</p>

<pre><code>synchronized(this) {
    if(busy)   // replaced the loop with a condition which is evaluated only once
        wait();
    busy = true;
}
...
synchronized(this) {
    busy = false;
    notify();
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the case if you have a large number of threads, or if the wait loop condition is costly to evaluate, <code>notify()</code> will be significantly faster than <code>notifyAll()</code>. For example, if you have 1000 threads then 999 threads will be awakened and evaluated after the first <code>notifyAll()</code>, then 998, then 997, and so on. On the contrary, with the <code>notify()</code> solution, only one thread will be awakened. </p>

<p>Use <code>notifyAll()</code> when you need to choose which thread will do the work next:
</p>

<pre><code>synchronized(this) {
    while(idx != last+1)  // wait until it's my turn
        wait();
}
...
synchronized(this) {
    last = idx;
    notifyAll();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, it's important to understand that in case of <code>notifyAll()</code>, the code inside <code>synchronized</code> blocks that have been awakened will be executed sequentially, not all at once. Let's say there are three threads waiting in the above example, and the fourth thread calls <code>notifyAll()</code>. All three threads will be awakened but only one will start execution and check the condition of the <code>while</code> loop. If the condition is <code>true</code>, it will call <code>wait()</code> again, and only then the second thread will start executing and will check its <code>while</code> loop condition, and so on.</p>

<p>You're correct that whether you use notify() or notifyAll(), the immediate result is that exactly one other thread will acquire the monitor and begin executing.

<p>Suppose thread A, B, and C were waiting on this object, and thread A gets the monitor. The difference lies in what happens once A releases the monitor.

When A releases the monitor, B and C will still be sitting there, waiting for a notify().</p>

<p>If you used notifyAll(), then B and C have both advanced past the ""wait for notification"" state and are both waiting to acquire the monitor. When A releases the monitor, either B or C will acquire it (assuming no other threads are competing for that monitor) and begin executing.</p>

18650599,2,,37026,9/6/2013 5:34,-1,,"<p>I would like to mention what is explained in Java Concurrency in Practice:</p>

<p><strong>First point, whether Notify or NotifyAll?</strong></p>

<pre><code>It will be NotifyAll, and reason is that it will save from signall hijacking.

<blockquote>
  <p>If two threads A and B are waiting on different condition predicates
  of same condition queue and notify is called, then it is upto JVM to
  which thread JVM will notify.</p>
  
  <p>Now if notify was meant for thread A and JVM notified thread B, then
  thread B will wake up and see that this notification is not useful so
  it will wait again. And Thread A will never come to know about this
  missed signal and someone hijacked it's notification.</p>
  
  <p>So, calling notifyAll will resolve this issue, but again it will have
  performance impact as it will notify all threads and all threads will
  compete for same lock and it will involve context switch and hence
  load on CPU. But we should care about performance only if it is
  behaving correctly, if it's behavior itself is not correct then
  performance is of no use.</p>

<p><strong>This problem can be solved with using Condition object of explicit locking Lock, provided in jdk 5, as it provides different wait for each condition predicate.

37093,2,,37041,8/31/2008 20:52,2,,"<p>For the asynchronous bit, I would suggest checking into java.util.concurrent, and especially the Future interface. The future interface is used to represent objects which are not ready yet, but are beeing created in a seperate thread. You say that objects can be modified at any time by a third party, but I would still suggest you use immutable return objects here, and instead have a seperate thread/event log you can subscribe to to get noticed when objects expire. I have little programming with UIs, but I believe using Futures for asynchronus calls would let you have a responsive gui, rather than one that was waiting for a server reply.</p>

<p>For the queries I would suggest using method chaining to build the query object, and each object returned by method chaining should be Iterable. Similar to how Djangos model is. Say you have QuerySet which implements Iterable. You can then call allSongs() which would return a result iterating over all Songs. Or allSongs().artist(""Beatles""), and you would have an iterable over all Betles songs. Or even allSongs().artist(""Beatles"").years(1965,1967) and so on. </p>

<p>Using Future for the async operations is interesting. The only drawback being that it is doesn't provide callbacks. But then again, I tried that approach, and look where that got me :)</p>

<p>I'm currently solving a similar problem using a worker thread and a blocking queue for dispatching the incoming command replies, but that approach doesn't translate very well.</p>

<p>The remote objects can be modified, but since I do use threads, I try to keep the objects immutable. My current hypothesis is that I will send notification events on track updates on the form</p>

<p>I'll definitely look into Djangos method chaining. I've been looking at some similar constructs but haven't been able to come up with a good variant.

<p>I am torn on whether to use getters for the Track objects or just expose the members since the object is immutable.</p>

<pre><code>class Track {
    public final String album;
    public final String artist;
    public final String title;
    public final String genre;
    public final String comment;

    public final String cover_id;

    public final long duration;
    public final long bitrate;
    public final long samplerate;
    public final long id;
    public final Date date;

    /* Some more stuff here */
}
</code></pre>

<p>Anybody who wants to know when something happened to a track in the library would implement this...</p>

<pre><code>interface TrackUpdateListener {
    void trackUpdate(Track oldTrack, Track newTrack);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is how querys are built. Chain calls to your hearts content. the jury is still out on the get() though. There are some details missing, such as how I should handle wildcards and more advanced queries with disjunctions. I might just need some completion callback functionality, perhaps similar to the <a href=""http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~schmidt/PDF/ACT.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Asynchronous Completion Token</a>, but we'll see about that. Perhaps that will happen in an additional layer.</p>

<pre><code>interface TrackQuery extends Iterable&lt;Track&gt; {
    TrackQuery years(int from, int to);
    TrackQuery artist(String name);
    TrackQuery album(String name);
    TrackQuery id(long id);
    TrackQuery ids(long id[]);

    Future&lt;Track[]&gt; get();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<pre><code>tracks.allTracks();
tracks.allTracks().artist(""Front 242"").album(""Tyranny (For You)"");
</code></pre>

<p>The tracks interface is mostly just the glue between the connection and the individual tracks. It will be the one implementing or managing meta-data caching, if any (as today, but I think I'll just remove it during the refactoring and see if I actually need it). Also, this provides medialib track updates as it would just be too much work to implement it by track.</p>

<pre><code>interface Tracks {
    TrackQuery allTracks();

    void addUpdateListener(TrackUpdateListener listener);
    void removeUpdateListener(TrackUpdateListener listener);
}

<p>You can use the task manager to tell windows what CPU(s) your program should be allowed to run on. Normally this is only useful for troubleshooting legacy programs which have broken implementations of multi-threading. To do this, </p>

<ul>
<li>Run task manager</li>
<li>Find your process in the <code>Processes</code> window.</li>
<li>Right click and choose <code>Set Affinity...</code></li>
<li>Tick the checkboxes next to the CPU's you want to allow your application to run on. Windows will then only schedule threads from that process onto those particular CPU's</li>
</ul>

<p>If I recall correctly, windows will 'remember' these settings for subsequent times your process is run, but please don't quote me on that - run some tests yourself :-)</p>

<p>You can also do this programatically in .NET after your program has launched using using the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.process.processoraffinity.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">System.Diagnostics.Process.ProcessorAffinity</a> property, but I don't think it will 'remember' the settings, so there will always be a short period in which your app is run on whichever CPU windows sees fit. I don't know how to do this in java sorry.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>This applies at the entire process level. If you set affinity for CPU0 only, and then launch 50 threads, all 50 of those threads will run on CPU0, and CPU1, 2, 3, etc will sit around doing nothing.</p>

<p>Just to reiterate the point, this is primarily useful for troubleshooting broken legacy software. If your software is not broken, you really shouldn't mess with any of these settings, and let windows decide the best CPU(s) to run your program on, so it can take the rest of the system's performance into account.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>As for the 'shared memory' model, it works the same, but there are more things that can go subtly wrong when your app is running on multiple CPU's as opposed to just timeslices on a single one.</p>

37349,2,,37335,9/1/2008 1:29,78,,"<p>Ultimately you always have a finite max of heap to use no matter what platform you are running on. In Windows 32 bit this is around 2gb (not specifically heap but total amount of memory per process). It just happens that Java happens to make the default smaller (presumably so that the programmer can't create programs that have runaway memory allocation without running into this problem and having to examine exactly what they are doing).</p>

<p>So this given there are several approaches you could take to either determine what amount of memory you need or to reduce the amount of memory you are using. One common mistake with garbage collected languages such as Java or C# is to keep around references to objects that you no longer are using, or allocating many objects when you could reuse them instead. As long as objects have a reference to them they will continue to use heap space as the garbage collector will not delete them.</p>

<p>In this case you can use a Java memory profiler to determine what methods in your program are allocating large number of objects and then determine if there is a way to make sure they are no longer referenced, or to not allocate them in the first place. One option which I have used in the past is ""JMP"" <a href=""http://www.khelekore.org/jmp/"">http://www.khelekore.org/jmp/</a>.</p>

<p>If you determine that you are allocating these objects for a reason and you need to keep around references (depending on what you are doing this might be the case), you will just need to increase the max heap size when you start the program. However, once you do the memory profiling and understand how your objects are getting allocated you should have a better idea about how much memory you need. </p>

<p>In general if you can't guarantee that your program will run in some finite amount of memory (perhaps depending on input size) you will always run into this problem. Only after exhausting all of this will you need to look into caching objects out to disk etc. At this point you should have a very good reason to say ""I need Xgb of memory"" for something and you can't work around it by improving your algorithms or memory allocation patterns. Generally this will only usually be the case for algorithms operating on large datasets (like a database or some scientific analysis program) and then techniques like caching and memory mapped IO become useful.</p>

37632,2,,37628,9/1/2008 8:44,332,,"<p>The name reflection is used to describe code which is able to inspect other code in the same system (or itself).</p>

<p>For example, say you have an object of an unknown type in Java, and you would like to call a 'doSomething' method on it if one exists. Java's static typing system isn't really designed to support this unless the object conforms to a known interface, but using reflection, your code can look at the object and find out if it has a method called 'doSomething' and then call it if you want to.</p>

<p>So, to give you a code example of this in Java (imagine the object in question is foo) :</p>

<pre><code>Method method = foo.getClass().getMethod(""doSomething"", null);
method.invoke(foo, null);
</code></pre>

<p>One very common use case in Java is the usage with annotations. JUnit 4, for example, will use reflection to look through your classes for methods tagged with the @Test annotation, and will then call them when running the unit test.</p>

<p>There are some good reflection examples to get you started at <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/index.html"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/index.html</a></p>

<p>And finally, yes, the concepts are pretty much similar in other statically types languages which support reflection (like C#). In dynamically typed languages, the use case described above is less necessary (since the compiler will allow any method to be called on any object, failing at runtime if it does not exist), but the second case of looking for methods which are marked or work in a certain way is still common.</p>

For example, all objects in Java has the method <b>getClass</b>, which lets you determine its class even if you don't know it at compile time (like if you declared it as <b>Object</b>) - this might seem trivial, but such reflection is not by default possible in less dynamic languages such as C++.</p>

<p>Reflection is important since it lets you write programs that does not have to ""know"" everything at compile time, making them more dynamic, since they can be tied together at runtime.

Also see the <a href=""http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/api/org/springframework/ejb/support/AbstractEnterpriseBean.html?is-external=true"" rel=""nofollow"">AbstractEnterpriseBean Javadoc</a> for some additional information about how the Spring context is retrieved.  </p>

92867,2,,37912,9/18/2008 14:11,0,,"<p>Using the WebServiceMessageDrivenBean is very similar to the Spring support for Message Driven Beans (MDBS).</p>

<p>First you create a MDB:</p>

<p><code>
public class HelloWorldMessageDrivenBean extends WebServiceMessageDrivenBean {<br />
    private static final long serialVersionUID = -2905491432314736668L;<br />
}<br />
</code></p>

<p>That is it as far as the MDB goes!</p>

<p>Next you configure the MDB by adding the following following to the MDB definition in the  ejb-jar.xml:</p>

<p><code>
<br />
    <br />
    ejb/BeanFactoryPath<br />
    java.lang.String<br />
    <br />
        application-context.xml<br />
    <br />
<br />
</code></p>

<p>This tells the Spring MDB support classes where to pick up your Spring configuration file.</p>

<p>You can now configure your endpoints either in the application-context.xml file or in addition using the annotation support.</p>

I ran up against this too. My solution was to represent the desired inheritance through interfaces rather than the entity beans themselves.</p>

<p>In your case, you could define the following:</p>

<pre><code>public interface Problem {
    public Person getPerson();
}

public interface UglyProblem extends Problem {
}

<p>Then implement these interfaces using an abstract superclass and two entity subclasses:</p>

public abstract class AbstractProblemImpl implements Problem {

    private Person person;

    public Person getPerson() {

@Entity
public class ProblemImpl extends AbstractProblemImpl implements Problem {
}

@Entity
public class UglyProblemImpl extends AbstractProblemImpl implements UglyProblem {

53448,2,,38057,9/10/2008 5:06,4,,"<p>I think it's a wise decision made by the Hibernate team. They could be less arrogante and make it clear why it was implemented this way, but that's just how Emmanuel, Chris and Gavin works. :)</p>

<p>Let's try to understand the problem. I think your concepts are ""lying"". Firts you say that many <strong>Problem</strong>s are associated to <strong>People</strong>. But, then you say that one <strong>Person</strong> have many <strong>UglyProblem</strong>s (and does not relate to other <strong>Problem</strong>s). Something is wrong with that design.</p>

<p>Imagine how it's going to be mapped to the database. You have a single table inheritance, so:</p>

<pre><code>          _____________
          |__PROBLEMS__|          |__PEOPLE__|
          |id &lt;PK&gt;     |          |          |
          |person &lt;FK&gt; | --------&gt;|          |
          |problemType |          |_________ |
          --------------
</code></pre>

<p>How is hibernate going to enforce the database to make <strong>Problem</strong> only relate to <strong>People</strong> if its <strong>problemType</strong> is equal UP? That's a very difficult problem to solve. So, if you want this kind of relation, every subclass must be in it's own table. That's what <em>@MappedSuperclass</em> does.</p>

<p>An example of why branch coverage is important is code that uses the ternary operator (a ? b : c).

With branch coverage it will be only 50% covered unless both branches have been executed.</p>

<p>Code coverage doesn't directly help you write better code, but it does help you write better tests, which in turn help you write better code.  Code coverage will uncover execution paths that are not being exercised by your tests.

39449,2,,39391,9/2/2008 13:06,13,,"<p>If you retrieve the URLConnection object using openConnection() it doesn't actually start communicating with the server.  That doesn't happen until you get the stream from the URLConnection().  When you first get the connection you can add/change headers and other connection properties before actually opening it.</p>

<p>URLConnection's lifecycle is a bit odd.  It doesn't send the headers to the server until you've gotten one of the streams.  If you just get the input stream then I believe it does a GET, sends the headers, then lets you read the output.  If you get the output stream then I believe it sends it as a POST, as it assumes you'll be writing data to it (You may need to call setDoOutput(true) for the output stream to work).  As soon as you get the input stream the output stream is closed and it waits for the response from the server.</p>

<p>For example, this should do a POST:</p>

<pre><code>URL myURL = new URL(""http://example.com/my/path"");
URLConnection conn = myURL.openConnection();
conn.setDoOutput(true);
conn.setDoInput(true);

OutputStream os = conn.getOutputStream();
os.write(""Hi there!"");
os.close();

InputStream is = conn.getInputStream();
// read stuff here
</code></pre>

<p>While this would do a GET:</p>

<pre><code>URL myURL = new URL(""http://example.com/my/path"");
URLConnection conn = myURL.openConnection();
conn.setDoOutput(false);
conn.setDoInput(true);

InputStream is = conn.getInputStream();
// read stuff here
</code></pre>

<p>URLConnection will also do other weird things.  If the server specifies a content length then URLConnection will keep the underlying input stream open until it receives that much data, <em>even if you explicitly close it</em>.  This caused a lot of problems for us as it made shutting our client down cleanly a bit hard, as the URLConnection would keep the network connection open.  This probably probably exists even if you just use getStream() though.</p>

<p>However, there are times when you can't use a tool: the heap dump is so huge it crashes the tool, you are trying to troubleshoot a machine in some production environment to which you only have shell access, etc.</p>

<p>In that case, it helps to know your way around the hprof dump file.</p>

<p>Look for SITES BEGIN. This shows you what objects are using the most memory. But the objects aren't lumped together solely by type: each entry also includes a ""trace"" ID. You can then search for that ""TRACE nnnn"" to see the top few frames of the stack where the object was allocated. Often, once I see where the object is allocated, I find a bug and I'm done. Also, note that you can control how many frames are recorded in the stack with the options to -Xrunhprof.</p>

<p>If you check out the allocation site, and don't see anything wrong, you have to start backward chaining from some of those live objects to root objects, to find the unexpected reference chain. This is where a tool really helps, but you can do the same thing by hand (well, with grep). There is not just one root object (i.e., object not subject to garbage collection). Threads, classes, and stack frames act as root objects, and anything they reference strongly is not collectible.</p>

<p>To do the chaining, look in the HEAP DUMP section for entries with the bad trace id. This will take you to an OBJ or ARR entry, which shows a unique object identifier in hexadecimal. Search for all occurrences of that id to find who's got a strong reference to the object. Follow each of those paths backward as they branch until you figure out where the leak is. See why a tool is so handy?</p>

<p>Static members are a repeat offender for memory leaks. In fact, even without a tool, it'd be worth spending a few minutes looking through your code for static Map members. Can a map grow large? Does anything ever clean up its entries?</p>

<li>Start the application and wait until it get to ""stable"" state, when all the initialization is complete and the application is idle.</li>
<li>Run the operation suspected of producing a memory leak several times to allow any cache, DB-related initialization to take place.</li>
<li>Run GC and take memory snapshot.</li>
<li>Run the operation again. Depending on the complexity of operation and sizes of data that is processed operation may need to be run several to many times.</li>
<li>Run GC and take memory snapshot.</li>
<li>Run a diff for 2 snapshots and analyze it.</li>

Treat each JSP imported as a black box, and refactor these pages around them (iteratively, testing each change and making sure it works before continuing).  Once these are cleaned up, you can continue finding pages with more and more imports, until finally you have refactored the imports.</p>

<p>When refactoring, note the parts that try to access resources not given to the page and try to take this out to a controller.  For instance, anything that accesses the database should be inside a controller, let the JSP handle the display of the information the controller gives to it via a forward.  In this way you will develop several servlets, or things like servlets, for each page.  I would suggest using a front-controller based framework for this refactoring (from personal experience I recommend Spring and its Controller interface), so that each controller isn't a separate Servlet but is rather delegated to from a single servlet that is mapped appropriately.</p>

<p>For the controller, it is better to do database hits all at once rather than attempt them piecemeal.  Users can and generally do tolerate a page load, but the page output will be much faster if all the database data is given to the rendering code rather than the rendering code hanging and not giving data to the client while it is trying to read yet another piece of data from the database.</p>

</ol>

<p>Note on Some Important Terms    </p>

<ol>
<li>Synchronized means only one thread can modify a hash table at one point of time. Basically, it means that any thread before performing an update on a hashtable will have to acquire a lock on the object while others will wait for lock to be released.</li>
<li>Fail-safe is relevant from the context of iterators. If an iterator has been created on a collection object and some other thread tries to modify the collection object ""structurally"", a concurrent modification exception will be thrown. It is possible for other threads though to invoke ""set"" method since it doesn't modify the collection ""structurally"". However, if prior to calling ""set"", the collection has been modified structurally, ""IllegalArgumentException"" will be thrown.</li>
<li>Structurally modification means deleting or inserting element which could effectively change the structure of map.</li>
</ol>

<p>HashMap can be synchronized by</p>

<p><code>Map m = Collections.synchronizeMap(hashMap);</code></p>

<p>Map provides Collection views instead of direct support for iteration
 via Enumeration objects. Collection views greatly enhance the
 expressiveness of the interface, as discussed later in this section.
 Map allows you to iterate over keys, values, or key-value pairs;
 Hashtable does not provide the third option. Map provides a safe way
 to remove entries in the midst of iteration; Hashtable did not.
 Finally, Map fixes a minor deficiency in the Hashtable interface.
 Hashtable has a method called contains, which returns true if the
 Hashtable contains a given value. Given its name, you'd expect this
 method to return true if the Hashtable contained a given key, because
 the key is the primary access mechanism for a Hashtable. The Map
 interface eliminates this source of confusion by renaming the method
 containsValue. Also, this improves the interface's consistency —
 containsValue parallels containsKey.</p>

The key point is that Java <strong>never</strong> provides direct access to the values of <em>objects themselves</em>, in <em>any</em> circumstances. The only access to objects is through a <em>reference</em> to that object. Because Java objects are <em>always</em> accessed through a reference, rather than directly, it is common to talk about fields and variables <em>and method arguments</em> as being <em>objects</em>, when pedantically they are only <em>references to objects</em>. <strong>The confusion stems from this (strictly speaking, incorrect) change in nomenclature.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>For primitive arguments (<code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, etc.), the pass by value is <em>the actual value</em> of the primitive (for example, 3).</li>
<li>For objects, the pass by value is the value of <em>the reference to the object</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So if you have <code>doSomething(foo)</code> and <code>public void doSomething(Foo foo) { .. }</code> the two Foos have copied <em>references</em> that point to the same objects.</p>

40630,2,,40480,9/2/2008 20:53,5,,"<p>To make a long story short, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Java</a> objects have some very peculiar properties.</p>

<p>In general, Java has primitive types (<code>int</code>, <code>bool</code>, <code>char</code>, <code>double</code>, etc) that are passed directly by value. Then Java has objects (everything that derives from <code>java.lang.Object</code>). Objects are actually always handled through a reference (a reference being a pointer that you can't touch). That means that in effect, objects are passed by value, as the references are normally not interesting. It does however mean that you cannot change which object is pointed to as the reference itself is passed by value.</p>

<p>Does this sound strange and confusing? Let's consider how C implements pass by reference and pass by value. In C, the default convention is pass by value. <code>void foo(int x)</code> passes an int by value. <code>void foo(int *x)</code> is a function that does not want an <code>int a</code>, but a pointer to an int: <code>foo(&amp;a)</code>. One would use this with the <code>&amp;</code> operator to pass a variable address.</p>

<p>Take this to C++, and we have references. References are basically (in this context) syntactic sugar that hide the pointer part of the equation: <code>void foo(int &amp;x)</code> is called by <code>foo(a)</code>, where the compiler itself knows that it is a reference and the address of the non-reference <code>a</code> should be passed. In Java, all variables referring to objects are actually of reference type, in effect forcing call by reference for most intends and purposes without the fine grained control (and complexity) afforded by, for example, C++.</p>

<p>Here is another example that will help you understand the difference (<a href=""http://www.javaranch.com/campfire/StoryPassBy.jsp"">the classic swap example</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before: a = 2, b = 3<br />

<p>This happens because iA and iB are new local reference variables that have the same value of the passed references (they point to a and b respectively). So, trying to change the references of iA or iB will only change in the local scope and not outside of this method.</p>

<p>The Java Spec says that everything in Java is pass-by-value. There is no such thing as ""pass-by-reference"" in Java.</p>

<p>The key to understanding this is that something like</p>

<pre><code>Dog myDog;
</code></pre>

<p>is <em>not</em> a Dog; it's actually a <em>pointer</em> to a Dog.</p>

<p>What that means, is when you have</p>

<pre><code>Dog myDog = new Dog(""Rover"");
foo(myDog);
</code></pre>

<p>you're essentially passing the <em>address</em> of the created <code>Dog</code> object to the <code>foo</code> method.</p>

<p>(I say essentially because Java pointers aren't direct addresses, but it's easiest to think of them that way)</p>

<p>Suppose the <code>Dog</code> object resides at memory address 42. This means we pass 42 to the method.</p>

<p>if the Method were defined as</p>

<pre><code>public void foo(Dog someDog) {
    someDog.setName(""Max"");     // AAA
    someDog = new Dog(""Fifi"");  // BBB
    someDog.setName(""Rowlf"");   // CCC
}
</code></pre>

<p>let's look at what's happening.</p>

<ul>
<li>the parameter <code>someDog</code> is set to the value 42</li>
<li>at line ""AAA""
<ul>
<li><code>someDog</code> is followed to the <code>Dog</code> it points to (the <code>Dog</code> object at address 42)</li>
<li>that <code>Dog</code> (the one at address 42) is asked to change his name to Max</li>
</ul></li>
<li>at line ""BBB""
<ul>
<li>a new <code>Dog</code> is created. Let's say he's at address 74</li>
<li>we assign the parameter <code>someDog</code> to 74 </li>
</ul></li>
<li>at line ""CCC""
<ul>
<li>someDog is followed to the <code>Dog</code> it points to (the <code>Dog</code> object at address 74)</li>
<li>that <code>Dog</code> (the one at address 74) is asked to change his name to Rowlf</li>
</ul></li>
<li>then, we return</li>
</ul>

<p>Now let's think about what happens outside the method:</p>

<p><em>Did <code>myDog</code> change?</em></p>

<p>There's the key.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind that <code>myDog</code> is a <em>pointer</em>, and not an actual <code>Dog</code>, the answer is NO. <code>myDog</code> still has the value 42; it's still pointing to the original <code>Dog</code>.</p>

<p>It's perfectly valid to <em>follow</em> an address and change what's at the end of it; that does not change the variable, however.</p>

<p>Java works exactly like C. You can assign a pointer, pass the pointer to a method, follow the pointer in the method and change the data that was pointed to. However, you cannot change where that pointer points.</p>

<p>In C++, Ada, Pascal and other languages that support pass-by-reference, you can actually change the variable that was passed.</p>

<p>If Java had pass-by-reference semantics, the <code>foo</code> method we defined above would have changed where <code>myDog</code> was pointing when it assigned <code>someDog</code> on line BBB.</p>

<p>Think of reference parameters as being aliases for the variable passed in. When that alias is assigned, so is the variable that was passed in.</p>

<p>Does that help? (I'll have to add this as an addendum to my article...)<br>

623155,2,,40480,3/8/2009 6:28,10,,"<p>You can never pass by reference in Java, and one of the ways that is obvious is when you want to return more than one value from a method call. Consider the following bit of code in C++:</p>

<pre><code>void getValues(int&amp; arg1, int&amp; arg2) {
    arg1 = 1;
    arg2 = 2;
}
void caller() {
    int x;
    int y;
    getValues(x, y);
    cout &lt;&lt; ""Result: "" &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; "" "" &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; endl;

<p>Sometimes you want to use the same pattern in Java, but you can't; at least not directly. Instead you could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>void getValues(int[] arg1, int[] arg2) {
    arg1[0] = 1;
    arg2[0] = 2;
}
void caller() {

    int[] y = new int[1];
    getValues(x, y);
    System.out.println(""Result: "" + x[0] + "" "" + y[0]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>As was explained in previous answers, in Java you're passing a pointer to the array as a value into <code>getValues</code>. That is enough, because the method then modifies the array element, and by convention you're expecting element 0 to contain the return value. Obviously you can do this in other ways, such as structuring your code so this isn't necessary, or constructing a class that can contain the return value or allow it to be set. But the simple pattern available to you in C++ above is not available in Java.</p>

707416,2,,40480,4/1/2009 21:33,15,,"<p>As far as I know, Java only knows call by value. This means for primitive datatypes you will work with an copy and for objects you will work with an copy of the reference to the objects.

<pre><code>public static void swap(StringBuffer s1, StringBuffer s2) {
    StringBuffer temp = s1;
    s1 = s2;
    s2 = temp;
}

    StringBuffer s2 = new StringBuffer(""World"");
    swap(s1, s2);
    System.out.println(s1);
    System.out.println(s2);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will populate Hello World and not World Hello because in the swap function you use copys which have no impact on the references in the main. But if your objects are not immutable you can change it for example:</p>

<pre><code>public static void appendWorld(StringBuffer s1) {
    s1.append("" World"");
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    StringBuffer s = new StringBuffer(""Hello"");
    appendWorld(s);
    System.out.println(s);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will populate Hello World on the command line. If you change StringBuffer into String it will produce just Hello because String is immutable. For example:</p>

<pre><code>public static void appendWorld(String s){
    s = s+"" World"";
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    String s = new String(""Hello"");
    appendWorld(s);
    System.out.println(s);
}
</code></pre>

<p>However you could make a wrapper for String like this which would make it able to use it with Strings:</p>

<pre><code>class StringWrapper {
    public String value;

    public StringWrapper(String value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
}

public static void appendWorld(StringWrapper s){
    s.value = s.value +"" World"";
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    StringWrapper s = new StringWrapper(""Hello"");
    appendWorld(s);
    System.out.println(s.value);

<p>Passing Variables into Methods (Objective 7.3)
7.3 Determine the effect upon object references and primitive values when they are passed into methods that perform assignments or other modifying operations on the parameters.
Methods can be declared to take primitives and/or object references. You need to know how (or if) the caller's variable can be affected by the called method. The difference between object reference and primitive variables, when passed into methods, is huge and important. To understand this section, you'll need to be comfortable with the assignments section covered in the first part of this chapter.
Passing Object Reference Variables
When you pass an object variable into a method, you must keep in mind that you're passing the object reference, and not the actual object itself. Remember that a reference variable holds bits that represent (to the underlying VM) a way to get to a specific object in memory (on the heap). More importantly, you must remember that you aren't even passing the actual reference variable, but rather a copy of the reference variable. A copy of a variable means you get a copy of the bits in that variable, so when you pass a reference variable, you're passing a copy of the bits representing how to get to a specific object. In other words, both the caller and the called method will now have identical copies of the reference, and thus both will refer to the same exact (not a copy) object on the heap.
For this example, we'll use the Dimension class from the java.awt package:</p>

<pre><code>1. import java.awt.Dimension;
2. class ReferenceTest {
3.     public static void main (String [] args) {
4.         Dimension d = new Dimension(5,10);
5.         ReferenceTest rt = new ReferenceTest();
6.         System.out.println(""Before modify() d.height = "" + d.height);
7.         rt.modify(d);
8.         System.out.println(""After modify() d.height = ""
9.     }
10.
11.
12.
13.   }
14. }
</code></pre>

<p>When we run this class, we can see that the modify() method was indeed able to modify the original (and only) Dimension object created on line 4.</p>

<pre>
C:\Java Projects\Reference>java ReferenceTest
Before modify() d.height = 10
dim = 11
After modify() d.height = 11
</pre>

<p>Notice when the Dimension object on line 4 is passed to the modify() method, any changes to the object that occur inside the method are being made to the object whose reference was passed. In the preceding example, reference variables d and dim both point to the same object.
Does Java Use Pass-By-Value Semantics?
If Java passes objects by passing the reference variable instead, does that mean Java uses pass-by-reference for objects? Not exactly, although you'll often hear and read that it does. Java is actually pass-by-value for all variables running within a single VM. Pass-by-value means pass-by-variable-value. And that means, pass-by-copy-of- the-variable! (There's that word copy again!)
It makes no difference if you're passing primitive or reference variables, you are always passing a copy of the bits in the variable. So for a primitive variable, you're passing a copy of the bits representing the value. For example, if you pass an int variable with the value of 3, you're passing a copy of the bits representing 3. The called method then gets its own copy of the value, to do with it what it likes.</p>

<p>And if you're passing an object reference variable, you're passing a copy of the bits representing the reference to an object. The called method then gets its own copy of the reference variable, to do with it what it likes. But because two identical reference variables refer to the exact same object, if the called method modifies the object (by invoking setter methods, for example), the caller will see that the object the caller's original variable refers to has also been changed. In the next section, we'll look at how the picture changes when we're talking about primitives.
The bottom line on pass-by-value: the called method can't change the caller's variable, although for object reference variables, the called method can change the object the variable referred to. What's the difference between changing the variable and changing the object? For object references, it means the called method can't reassign the caller's original reference variable and make it refer to a different object, or null. For example, in the following code fragment,</p>

<pre><code>        void bar() {
           Foo f = new Foo();
           doStuff(f);
        }
        void doStuff(Foo g) {
           g.setName(""Boo"");
           g = new Foo();
        }
</code></pre>

<p>reassigning g does not reassign f! At the end of the bar() method, two Foo objects have been created, one referenced by the local variable f and one referenced by
the local (argument) variable g. Because the doStuff() method has a copy of the reference variable, it has a way to get to the original Foo object, for instance to call the setName() method. But, the doStuff() method does not have a way to get to the f reference variable. So doStuff() can change values within the object f refers to, but doStuff() can't change the actual contents (bit pattern) of f. In other words, doStuff() can change the state of the object that f refers to, but it can't make f refer to a different object!
Passing Primitive Variables
Let's look at what happens when a primitive variable is passed to a method:</p>

<pre><code>class ReferenceTest {
    public static void main (String [] args) {
      int a = 1;
      ReferenceTest rt = new ReferenceTest();
      System.out.println(""Before modify() a = "" + a);
      rt.modify(a);
      System.out.println(""After modify() a = "" + a);
    }
    void modify(int number) {
      number = number + 1;
      System.out.println(""number = "" + number);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this simple program, the variable a is passed to a method called modify(),
which increments the variable by 1. The resulting output looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>  Before modify() a = 1
  number = 2
  After modify() a = 1
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that a did not change after it was passed to the method. Remember, it was a copy of a that was passed to the method. When a primitive variable is passed to a method, it is passed by value, which means pass-by-copy-of-the-bits-in-the-variable.</p>

<p>Crash course on stack/heap before we get to the Java implementation:
Values go on and off the stack in a nice orderly fashion, like a stack of plates at a cafeteria.
Memory in the heap (also known as dynamic memory) is haphazard and disorganized. The JVM just finds space wherever it can, and frees it up as the variables that use it are no longer needed.</p>

<p>Okay. First off, primitives go on the stack. So this code:</p>

<pre><code>int x = 3;
float y = 101.1f;
boolean amIAwesome = true;
</code></pre>

<p>results in this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/7nGKU.png"" alt=""primitives on the stack""></p>

<p>When you declare and instantiate an object. The actual object goes on the heap. What goes on the stack? The address of the object on the heap. C++ programmers would call this a pointer, but some Java developers are racist against the word ""pointer"". Whatever. Just know that the address of the object goes in the stack.</p>

<p>Like so:</p>

<pre><code>int problems = 99;
String name = ""Jay-Z"";
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/yTIYp.png"" alt=""a b*7ch aint one!""></p>

<p>An array is an object, so it goes on the heap as well. And what about the objects in the array? They get their own heap space, and the address of each object goes inside the array.</p>

<pre><code>JButton[] marxBros = new JButton[3];
marxBros[0] = new JButton(""Groucho"");
marxBros[1] = new JButton(""Zeppo"");
marxBros[2] = new JButton(""Harpo"");
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/v2b33.png"" alt=""marx brothers""></p>

<p>So, what gets passed in when you call a method? If you pass in an object, what you're actually passing in is the address of the object. Some might say the ""value"" of the address, and some say it's just a reference to the object. This is the genesis of the holy war between ""reference"" and ""value"" proponents. What you call it isn't as important as that you understand that what's getting passed in is the address to the object.</p>

<p>One String gets created and space for it is allocated in the heap, and the address to the string is stored on the stack and given the identifier <code>hisName</code>, since the address of the second String is the same as the first, no new String is created and no new heap space is allocated, but a new identifier is created on the stack. Then we call <code>shout()</code>: a new stack frame is created and a new identifier, <code>name</code> is created and assigned the address of the already-existing String.</p>

19421107,2,,40480,10/17/2013 7:54,7,,"<p><strong>Java is always pass by values NOT pass by reference</strong> </p>

<p>first of we understand what is pass by value and pass by reference</p>

<p><strong>pass by value means you are making a copy in memory of the actual parameter's value that is passed in, a copy of the contents of the actual parameter</strong></p>

<p><strong>pass by reference (also called pass by address), a copy of the address of the actual parameter is stored</strong></p>

<p>Some time it gives illusion pass by reference.lets see how it works by example</p>

<pre><code>public class Passbyvalue {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        test t=new test();
        t.name=""initialvalue"";
        new Passbyvalue().changeValue(t);
        System.out.println(t.name);
    }

    public void changeValue(test f){
        f.name=""changevalue"";
    }
}

class test{
    String name;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output of this program is </p>

<p><strong>changevalue</strong></p>

<p>lets understand step by step</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>test t=new test();</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as we all know it will create object in heap and return return reference value back to t. suppose for example value of t is 0x100234(its JVM internal value as we don't about it i have just consider it for example) </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/AVrhI.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>new Passbyvalue().changeValue(t);</p>
</blockquote>

<p>when passing reference t to function it will not directly pass actual reference value of object test but it will create copy of t and then it pass to function ( as it <strong>pass by value</strong> it passes copy of variable not actual reference of it) . As we consider value of t will be0x100234 . so in this way both t and f will have same value and hence they will point to same object</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/WwdPh.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>so if you change any thing in function using reference f it will modify existing contain of object that why we were getting output ""changevalue"" which is updated in function</p>

<p>to understand this more clearly consider following example</p>

<pre><code>public class Passbyvalue {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        test t=new test();
        t.name=""initialvalue"";
        new Passbyvalue().changerefence(t);
        System.out.println(t.name);
    }

    public void changerefence(test f){
        f=null;
    }
}

class test{
    String name;
}

<blockquote>
  <p>Unsafe:</p>
  
  <p>Characters can be unsafe for a number of reasons.  The space
    character is unsafe because significant spaces may disappear and
    insignificant spaces may be introduced when URLs are transcribed or
    typeset or subjected to the treatment of word-processing programs.
    The characters ""&lt;"" and "">"" are unsafe because they are used as the
    delimiters around URLs in free text; the quote mark ("""""") is used to
    delimit URLs in some systems.  The character ""#"" is unsafe and should
    always be encoded because it is used in World Wide Web and in other
    systems to delimit a URL from a fragment/anchor identifier that might
    follow it.  The character ""%"" is unsafe because it is used for
    encodings of other characters.  Other characters are unsafe because
    gateways and other transport agents are known to sometimes modify
    such characters. These characters are ""{"", ""}"", ""|"", ""\"", ""^"", ""~"",
    ""["", ""]"", and ""`"".</p>
  
  <p>All unsafe characters must always be encoded within a URL. For
    example, the character ""#"" must be encoded within URLs even in
    systems that do not normally deal with fragment or anchor
    identifiers, so that if the URL is copied into another system that
    does use them, it will not be necessary to change the URL encoding.</p>

<p>Each node needn't be immutable internally to the package, only to the outward-facing interface. <code>node.addChild()</code> would be an immutable function with public visibility and return a Document, wheras <code>node.addChildInternal()</code> would be be a normal, mutable function with package visibility. But since it is internal to the package, it can only be called as a descendent of <code>addChild()</code> and the structure as a whole is guarenteed to be thread safe (provided I synchronize access to the object pool). Do you see a flaw in this...? If so, please tell me!</p>

<p>The tree as a whole will be immutable. Say I have Thread1 and Thread2, and tree dom1. Thread1 starts a read operation on dom1, while, concurrently, Thread2 starts a write operation on dom1. However, all the changes Thread2 makes will actually be made to a new object, dom2, and dom1 will be immutable. It is true that the values read by Thread1 will be (a few microseconds) out of date, but it won't crash on an IndexOutOfBounds or NullPointer exception or something like it would if it was reading a mutable object that was being written to. Then, Thread2 can fire an event containing dom2 to Thread1 so that it can do its read again and update its results, if necessary.</p>

<p>If you choose to implement the tree as a set of nodes pointing to the children, then you would have to create new nodes along the path of the changed node to the root.

<p>If you can cope with a less direct implementation, you should be able to get away with only creating parts of nodes, using techniques similar to those described in <a href=""http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SxPzSTcTalAC"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Purely Functional Data Structures"">Purely Functional Data Structures</a> to either reduce the average cost of the creation, or you can by-pass it using semi-functional approaches (such as creating an iterator which wraps an existing iterator, but returns the new node instead of the old, together with a mechanism to repair such patches in the structure as time goes on). An XPath style api might be better than a DOM api in that case - it might you decouple the nodes from the tree a bit more, and treat the mutated tree more intelligently. </p>

<p>You may be able to achieve the same effect by using reflection to get Method objects you can then invoke, and the other way is to create an interface with a single 'invoke' or 'execute' method, and then instantiate them to call the method your interested in (i.e. using an anonymous inner class).</p>

45035,2,,43842,9/5/2008 0:25,1,,"<p>It's worth knowing that the date format you have given is not an arbitrary one. It is the output of the built-in Date.toString() method (at least in the UK and US locales). Not coincidentally, it is also the format of the unix 'date' command (at least on linux, and I believe in other implementations too) - though to be pedantic, Date.toString() pads one-digit day numbers with a zero while unix date does not.</p>

<p>What this means is that you are likely to receive this input format when you output an unformatted date into a user-modifiable field (e.g. an HTML INPUT field) and receive it back unmodified. So just because input is coming in this format, doesn't mean the users will type in a thousand other arbitrary formats.</p>

<p>Of course, they still might. The way I handle date inputs in general is with a bunch of try/catch blocks, where I try it against one format, then another, then another. Our standard framework is now up to about 20 different formats by default. Of course it is still not perfect; I found someone the other day entering ""03 Sept"" as the date (a non-standard month abbreviation, and with no year) and we hadn't handled that scenario.</p>

<p>If you are using plain JSP views (as is most common), then simply add</p>

<p><strong>Detail</strong></p>

<p>In MVC, i would always set this in the view, and in most cases with Spring-MVC, use the <code>SimpleMappingExceptionResolver</code> to present the correct view in response to a thrown runtime Exception. </p>

<p>For example: create and throw a <code>PermissionDeniedException</code> in your controller or service layer and have the exception resolver point to a view file <code>permissionDenied.jsp</code>. This view file sets the 403 status and shows the user an appropriate message.</p>

<p>In your Spring bean XML file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id=""exceptionResolver""
      class=""org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.SimpleMappingExceptionResolver""&gt;
  &lt;property name=""exceptionMappings""&gt;
    &lt;props&gt;
      &lt;prop key=""PermissionDeniedException""&gt;          
        rescues/permissionDenied
      &lt;/prop&gt;
      ... set other exception/view mappings as &lt;prop&gt;s here ...
    &lt;/props&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;
  &lt;property name=""defaultErrorView"" value=""rescues/general"" /&gt;

I doubt that doing comparisons on big integers would be substantially faster than doing string comparisons in the first place.  I'll second what other's have said here, use some sort of hash, then in the event of a hash match check the original strings to weed out any collisions.</p>

<p>In any case, If your strings are around 10 characters, I doubt that comparing, say, a bunch of 32 bit hashes will be all that much faster than direct string comparisons.  I think you have to ask yourself if it's it really worth the additional complexity.</p>

46247,2,,46160,9/5/2008 16:36,2,,"<p>At the end of the day, a single alphanumeric character has at least 36 possible values.  If you include punctuation, lower case, etc then you can easily pass 72 possible values.</p>

<p>A non-colliding number that allows you to quickly compare strings would necessarily grow exponentially with the length of the string.</p>

<p>So you <em>first</em> must decide on the longest string you are expecting to compare.  Assuming it's N characters in length, and assuming you ONLY need uppercase letters and the numerals 0-9 then you need to have an integer representation that can be as high as
36^N</p>

<p>For a string of length 25 (common name field) then you end up needing a binary number with  130 bits.</p>

<p>If you compose that into 32 bit numbers, you'll need 4.  Then you can compare each number (four integer compares should take no time, compared to walking the string).  I would recommend a big number library, but for this specialized case I'm pretty sure you can write your own and get better performance.</p>

<p>If you want to handle 72 possible values per character (uppercase, lowercase, numerals, punctuation...) and you need 10 characters, then you'll need 62 bits - two 32 bit integers (or one 64 bit if you're on a system that supports 64 bit computing)</p>

<p>If, however, you are not able to restrict the numbers in the string (ie, could be any of the 256 letters/numbers/characters/etc) and you can't define the size of the string, then comparing the strings directly is the only way to go, but there's a shortcut.</p>

<p>Cast the pointer of the string to a 32 bit unsigned integer array, and compare the string 4 bytes at a time (or 64 bits/8bytes at a time on a 64 bit processor).  This means that a 100 character string only requires 25 compares maximum to find which is greater.</p>

<p>You may need to re-define the character set (and convert the strings) so that the characters with higher precedence are assigned values closer to 0, and lower precedence values closer to 255 (or vice versa, depending on how you are comparing them).</p>

However, the <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/SortedMap.html""><code>SortedMap</code></a> interface extends <code>Map</code> and provides exactly what you are looking for - implementations will aways give a consistent sort order.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/NavigableMap.html""><code>NavigableMap</code></a> is another useful extension</strong> - this is a <code>SortedMap</code> with additional methods for finding entries by their ordered position in the key set.  So potentially this can remove the need for iterating in the first place - you might be able to find the specific <code>entry</code> you are after using the <code>higherEntry</code>, <code>lowerEntry</code>, <code>ceilingEntry</code>, or <code>floorEntry</code> methods.  The <code>descendingMap</code> method even gives you an explicit method of <strong>reversing the traversal order</strong>.</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll want to do more in the <code>catch</code> blocks than print the stack trace as I did in the example code above.  Remove the <code>catch</code> blocks to see which method calls from the JavaMail API throw exceptions so you can better see how to properly handle them.</p>

47628,2,,47605,9/6/2008 16:25,131,,"<p>No, not quite.</p>

<p>Firstly, there's a slight difference in semantics. If a is null, then the <code>concat()</code> method NPEs but the former will treat the original value of a as if it were ""null"". Furthermore, the <code>concat()</code> method only accepts <code>String</code> values while the <code>+</code> operator will silently convert the argument to a String (using the <code>toString()</code> method for objects). So the <code>concat()</code> method is more strict in what it accepts.</p>

<p>To look under the hood, write a simple class with a += b;</p>

<pre><code>public class Concat {
    String cat(String a, String b) {
        a += b;
        return a;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now disassemble with javap -c (included in the Sun JDK). You should see a listing including:</p>

<pre><code>java.lang.String cat(java.lang.String, java.lang.String);
  Code:
   0:   new     #2; //class java/lang/StringBuilder
   3:   dup
   4:   invokespecial   #3; //Method java/lang/StringBuilder.""&lt;init&gt;"":()V
   7:   aload_1
   8:   invokevirtual   #4; //Method java/lang/StringBuilder.append:(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;
   11:  aload_2
   12:  invokevirtual   #4; //Method java/lang/StringBuilder.append:(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;
   15:  invokevirtual   #5; //Method java/lang/StringBuilder.toString:()Ljava/lang/    String;
   18:  astore_1
   19:  aload_1
   20:  areturn

<p>So, a += b is the equivalent of</p>

<pre><code>a = new StringBuilder()
    .append(a)
    .append(b)
    .toString();
</code></pre>

<p>The concat method should be faster. However, with more strings the StringBuilder method wins, at least in terms of performance.</p>

<p>The source code of String and StringBuilder (and its package-private base class) is available in src.zip of the Sun JDK. You can see that you are building up a char array (resizing as necessary) and then throwing it away when you create the final String. In practice memory allocation is surprisingly fast.</p>

<p>Finally, all of these methods are in fact incredibly fast.  This might be a case of premature optimization.  If you have code that concatenates strings a lot, the way to get maximum speed probably has nothing to do with which operators you choose and instead the algorithm you're using!</p>

48153,2,,48144,9/7/2008 4:46,27,,"<p>Hank Shiffman from SGI said (a long time ago, but it's till true):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are three advantages of Java
  using byte code instead of going to
  the native code of the system:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p><strong>Portability</strong>: Each kind of computer has its unique instruction
  set. While some processors include the
  instructions for their predecessors,
  it's generally true that a program
  that runs on one kind of computer
  won't run on any other. Add in the
  services provided by the operating
  system, which each system describes in
  its own unique way, and you have a
  compatibility problem. In general, you
  can't write and compile a program for
  one kind of system and run it on any
  other without a lot of work. Java gets
  around this limitation by inserting
  its virtual machine between the
  application and the real environment
  (computer + operating system). If an
  application is compiled to Java byte
  code and that byte code is interpreted
  the same way in every environment then
  you can write a single program which
  will work on all the different
  platforms where Java is supported.
  (That's the theory, anyway. In
  practice there are always small
  incompatibilities lying in wait for
  the programmer.)</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Security</strong>: One of Java's virtues is its integration into the Web. Load
  a web page that uses Java into your
  browser and the Java code is
  automatically downloaded and executed.
  But what if the code destroys files,
  whether through malice or sloppiness
  on the programmer's part? Java
  prevents downloaded applets from doing
  anything destructive by disallowing
  potentially dangerous operations.
  Before it allows the code to run it
  examines it for attempts to bypass
  security. It verifies that data is
  used consistently: code that
  manipulates a data item as an integer
  at one stage and then tries to use it
  as a pointer later will be caught and
  prevented from executing. (The Java
  language doesn't allow pointer
  arithmetic, so you can't write Java
  code to do what we just described.
  However, there is nothing to prevent
  someone from writing destructive byte
  code themselves using a hexadecimal
  editor or even building a Java byte
  code assembler.) It generally isn't
  possible to analyze a program's
  machine code before execution and
  determine whether it does anything
  bad. Tricks like writing
  self-modifying code mean that the evil
  operations may not even exist until
  later. But Java byte code was designed
  for this kind of validation: it
  doesn't have the instructions a
  malicious programmer would use to hide
  their assault.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Size</strong>: In the microprocessor world RISC is generally preferable
  over CISC. It's better to have a small
  instruction set and use many fast
  instructions to do a job than to have
  many complex operations implemented as
  single instructions. RISC designs
  require fewer gates on the chip to
  implement their instructions, allowing
  for more room for pipelines and other
  techniques to make each instruction
  faster. In an interpreter, however,
  none of this matters. If you want to
  implement a single instruction for the
  switch statement with a variable
  length depending on the number of case
  clauses, there's no reason not to do
  so. In fact, a complex instruction set
  is an advantage for a web-based
  language: it means that the same
  program will be smaller (fewer
  instructions of greater complexity),
  which means less time to transfer
  across our speed-limited network.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>So when considering byte code vs native, consider which trade-offs you want to make between portability, security, size, and execution speed. If speed is the only important factor, go native. If any of the others are more important, go with bytecode.</p>

<p>I'll also add that maintaining a series of OS and architecture-targeted compilations of the same code base for every release can become very tedious. It's a huge win to use the same Java bytecode on multiple platforms and have it ""just work.""</p>

48156,2,,48144,9/7/2008 4:50,1,,"<p>Ideally you would have portable bytecode that compiles Just In Time to native code.  I think the reason bytecode interpreters exist without JIT is due primarily to the practical fact that native code compilation adds complexity to a virtual machine.  It takes time to build, debug, and maintain that additional component.  Not everyone has the time or resources to make that commitment.</p>

<p>A secondary factor is safety.  It's much easier to verify an interpreter won't crash than to guarantee the same for native code.</p>

<p>Third is performance.  It can often take more time to generate machine code than to interpret bytecode for small pieces of code that only run once.</p>

48159,2,,48144,9/7/2008 4:56,14,,"<p>The performance of essentially any program will improve if it is compiled, executed with profiling, and the results fed back into the compiler for a second pass. The code paths which are actually used will be more aggressively optimized, loops unrolled to exactly the right degree, and the hot instruction paths arranged to maximize I$ hits.</p>

<p>All good stuff, yet it is almost never done because it is annoying to go through so many steps to build a binary.</p>

<p>This is the advantage of running the bytecode for a while before compiling it to native code: profiling information is automatically available. The result after Just-In-Time compilation is highly optimized native code for the specific data the program is processing.</p>

<p>Being able to run the bytecode also enables more aggressive native optimization than a static compiler could safely use. For example if one of the arguments to a function is noted to always be NULL, all handling for that argument can simply be omitted from the native code. There will be a brief validity check of the arguments in the function prologue, if that argument is not NULL the VM aborts back to the bytecode and starts profiling again.</p>

  <p>Atwood: Well, I originally asked on Twitter, because I just wanted something light weight.  I really didn't want to like write a windows service.  I felt like that was out of band code. Plus the code that actually does the work is a web page in fact, because to me that is a logical unit of work on a website is a web page.  So, it really is like we are calling back into the web site, it's just like another request in the website, so I viewed it as something that should stay inline, and the little approach that we came up that was recommended to me on Twitter was to essentially to add something to the application cache with a fixed expiration, then you have a call back so when that expires it calls a certain function which does the work then you add it back in to the cache with the same expiration.  So, it's a little bit, maybe ""ghetto"" is the right word.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My approach has always been to have to OS (i.e. Cron or the Windows task scheduler) load a specific URL at some interval, and then setup a page at that URL to check it's queue, and perform whatever tasks were required, but I'd be interested to hear if there's a better way.</p>

<p>From the transcript, it looks like FogBugz uses the windows service loading a URL approach also.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Spolsky: So we have this special page called heartbeat.asp.  And that page, whenever you hit it, and anybody can hit it at anytime: doesn't hurt.  But when that page runs it checks a queue of waiting tasks to see if there's anything that needs to be done.  And if there's anything that needs to be done, it does one thing and then looks in that queue again and if there's anything else to be done it returns a plus, and the entire web page that it returns is just a single character with a plus in it.  And if there's nothing else to be done, the queue is now empty, it returns a minus.  So, anybody can call this and hit it as many times, you can load up heartbeat.asp in your web browser you hit Ctrl-R Ctrl-R Ctrl-R Ctrl-R until you start getting minuses instead of pluses.  And when you've done that FogBugz will have completed all of its maintenance work that it needs to do.  So that's the first part, and the second part is a very, very simple Windows service which runs, and its whole job is to call heartbeat.asp and if it gets a plus, call it again soon, and if it gets a minus call it again, but not for a while.  So basically there's this Windows service that's always running, that has a very, very, very simple task of just hitting a URL, and looking to see if it gets a plus or a minus and, and then scheduling when it runs again based on whether it got a plus or a minus.  And obviously you can do any kind of variation you want on this theme, like for example, uh you could actually, instead of returning just a plus or minus you could say ""Okay call me back in 60 seconds"" or ""Call me back right away I have more work to be done.""  And that's how it works... so that maintenance service it just runs, you know, it's like, you know, a half page of code that runs that maintenance service, and it never has to change, and it doesn't have any of the logic in there, it just contains the tickling that causes these web pages to get called with a certain guaranteed frequency.  And inside that web page at heartbeat.asp there's code that maintains a queue of tasks that need to be done and looks at how much time has elapsed and does, you know, late-night maintenance and every seven days delete all the older messages that have been marked as spam and all kinds of just maintenance background tasks.  And uh, that's how that does that.</p>

<p>The main difference between Vector and ArrayList is that the former is synchronized, the latter is not synchronized. You can read more about synchronization in <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321349601"" rel=""nofollow"">Java Concurrency in Practice</a>.</p>

<p>The difference between Hashtable (note that the T is not a capital letter) and HashMap is similiar, the former is synchronized, the latter is not synchronized.</p>

<p>I would say that there are no rule of thumb for preferring one implementation or another, it really depends on your needs.</p>

<ul>

<li>Will it be accessed by multiple threads</li>
<li>Do I need a key/value pair</li>

<p>I'll use a Map whenever I'll need to perform a lookup.</p>

<p>For the specific implementations, there are order-preserving variations of Maps and Sets but largely it comes down to speed. I'll tend to use ArrayList for reasonably small Lists and HashSet for reasonably small sets, but there are many implementations (including any that you write yourself). HashMap is pretty common for Maps. Anything more than 'reasonably small' and you have to start worrying about memory so that'll be way more specific algorithmically.</p>

<p><strong>List</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>ArrayList</strong> is quick on retrieving, but slow on inserting. It's good for an implementation that reads a lot but doesn't insert/remove a lot. It keeps its data in one continuous block of memory, so every time it needs to expand, it copies the whole array.</li>
<li><strong>LinkedList</strong> is slow on retrieving, but quick on inserting. It's good for an implementation that inserts/removes a lot but doesn't read a lot. It doesn't keep the entire array in one continuous block of memory.</li>

<p><strong>Set:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>HashSet</strong> doesn't guarantee the order of iteration, and therefore is fastest of the sets. It has high overhead and is slower than ArrayList, so you shouldn't use it except for a large amount of data when its hashing speed becomes a factor.</li>
<li><strong>TreeSet</strong> keeps the data ordered, therefore is slower than HashSet.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Map:</strong> The performance and behavior of HashMap and TreeMap are parallel to the Set implementations.</p>

<p>Vector and Hashtable should not be used. They are synchronized implementations, before the release of the new Collection hierarchy, thus slow. If synchronization is needed, use Collections.synchronizedCollection().</p>

<p>Vector and Hashtable are synchronised and therefore might be a bit slower. It's rare that you would want synchronised implementations, and when you do their interfaces are not sufficiently rich for thier synchronisation to be useful. In the case of Map, ConcurrentMap adds extra operations to make the interface useful. ConcurrentHashMap is a good implementation of ConcurrentMap.</p>

<p>LinkedList is almost never a good idea. Even if you are doing a lot of insertions and removal, if you are using an index to indicate position then that requires iterating through the list to find the correct node. ArrayList is almost always faster.</p>

<p>Third (and possibly offering the strongest protection) is to use native ahead of time compilers like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection"">GCC</a> or <a href=""http://www.excelsior-usa.com/jet.html"">Excelsior JET</a>, for example, that compile your Java code directly to a platform specific native binary.</p>

<p>In any case You've got to remember that as the saying goes in Estonian ""Locks are for animals"". Meaning that every bit of code is available (loaded into memory) during the runtime and given enough skill, determination and motivation, people can and will decompile, unscramble and hack your code... Your job is simply to make the process as uncomfortable as you can and still keep the thing working...</p>

Some terminology -</p>

<pre><code>E(X) = Enctrypt message X
D(X) = Dectrypt X. (Note that D(E(X)) = X)
IV = Initialization vector. A random sequence to bootstrap the CBC algorithm
CBC = Cipher block chaining.

<p>A really simple CBC implementation can look like:
P1, P2, P3 = Plain text messages</p>

<pre><code>1. Generate an IV, just random bits.
2. Calculate E( P1 xor IV) call this C1
3. Calculate E( P2 xor C1) call this C2
4. Calculate E( P3 xor C2) call this C3.

It doesn't matter so much whether those games are Java or C++, so long as they demonstrate your ideas and abilities. However I think you should set your expectations that if you make it into in the industry, you probably won't be using Java.</p>

<p>Casual web-based games have moved away from Java to Flash, because a considerably higher percentage of casual web surfers have Flash installed than have a JRE.</p>

<p>Console and PC games do not use Java to any extent. They are primarily C++ right now.</p>

<p>High end smartphones (Symbian, Windows Mobile, iPhone, etc) have native SDKs, and if they support Java at all tend to discourage its use. Blackberry is Java based, but there are relatively few games for the Blackberry. I'd have to speculate there is not much demand for games on that device.</p>

<p>The one place where Java is commonly used for games is in low end mobile phones. This has not been a terribly successful category, only a few companies have made money. There are two problems with this space, so far as I can tell:<br />
* write-once-run-anywhere never worked out. The QA and testing load to support a reasonable selection of devices is demanding, and never-ending since new phones come out all the time.<br />
* To distribute your game you need a business relationship with the wireless carrier, and they demand a 50% (or more) cut.  </p>

<p>One last thing: the games industry is famous for programmer burnout. You should search Google for stories about developers at Electronic Arts. Games nowadays are extraordinarily large projects which <em>must</em> meet a particular deadline to have a chance at making their sales targets, and they ratchet up the hours as needed to meet that deadline. Developer burnout is handled via the never-ending supply of young developers enamored with developing games for a living, i.e. replace burned out engineers with fresh ones.</p>

<li><p>List comprehensions.  I often find myself filtering/mapping lists, and being able to say <code>[line.replace(""spam"",""eggs"") for line in open(""somefile.txt"") if line.startswith(""nee"")]</code> is really nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Functions are first class objects.  They can be passed as parameters to other functions, defined inside other function, and have lexical scope.  This makes it really easy to say things like <code>people.sort(key=lambda p: p.age)</code> and thus sort a bunch of people on their age without having to define a custom comparator class or something equally verbose.</p></li>
<li><p>Everything is an object.  Java has basic types which aren't objects, which is why many classes in the standard library define 9 different versions of functions (for boolean, byte, char, double, float, int, long, Object, short).  <code>Array.sort</code> is a good example.  Autoboxing helps, although it makes things awkward when something turns out to be null.</p></li>
<li><p>Properties.  Python lets you create classes with read-only fields, lazily-generated fields, as well as fields which are checked upon assignment to make sure they're never 0 or null or whatever you want to guard against, etc.'</p></li>
<li><p>Default and keyword arguments.  In Java if you want a constructor that can take up to 5 optional arguments, you must define 6 different versions of that constructor.  And there's no way at all to say <code>Student(name=""Eli"", age=25)</code></p></li>
<li><p>Functions can only return 1 thing.  In Python you have tuple assignment, so you can say <code>spam, eggs = nee()</code> but in Java you'd need to either resort to mutable out parameters or have a custom class with 2 fields and then have two additional lines of code to extract those fields.</p></li>
<li><p>Built-in syntax for lists and dictionaries.</p></li>
<li><p>Operator Overloading.</p></li>
<li><p>Generally better designed libraries.  For example, to parse an XML document in Java, you say<br />
<code>Document doc = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance().newDocumentBuilder().parse(""test.xml"");</code><br />

<code>doc = parse(""test.xml"")</code></p></li>

<p>Anyway, I could go on and on with further examples, but Python is just overall a much more flexible and expressive language.  It's also dynamically typed, which I really like, but which comes with some disadvantages.</p>

Sometimes those things matter a lot and Java is the better language than Python for a task; I continue to use Java for some new projects despite liking Python a lot more.

50509,2,,48733,9/8/2008 19:45,4,,"<p>A Hibernate session loads all data it reads from the DB into what they call the <i>first-level cache</i>. Once a row is loaded from the DB, any subsequent fetches for a row with the same PK will return the data from this cache. Furthermore, Hibernate gaurentees reference equality for objects with the same PK in a single Session. </p>

<p>From what I understand, your read-only server application never closes its Hibernate session. So when the DB gets updated by the read-write application, the Session on read-only server is unaware of the change. Effectively, your read-only application is loading an in-memory copy of the database and using that copy, which gets stale in due course.</p>

<p>The simplest and best course of action I can suggest is to close and open Sessions as needed. This sidesteps the whole problem. Hibernate Sessions are intended to be a window for a short-lived interaction with the DB. I agree that there is a performance gain by not reloading the object-graph again and again; but you need to measure it and convince yourself that it is worth the pains.</p>

<p>Another option is to close and reopen the Session periodically. This ensures that the read-only application works with data not older than a given time interval. But there definitely is a window where the read-only application works with stale data (although the design guarantees that it gets the up-to-date data eventually). This might be permissible in many applications - you need to evaluate your situation. </p>

<p>The third option is to use a <i>second level cache</i> implementation, and use short-lived Sessions. There are various caching packages that work with Hibernate with relative merits and demerits.</p>

<p>Even with the Sun JVM you could have problems.  I've had fun where I've had two 3rd-party Applets requiring different versions of Java which causes all sorts of problems.  Sun have tried to solve this problem by replacing Applets with <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/javawebstart/index.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">Java Web Start</a> which gives you a link in the browser that launches the application in it's own window instead of inside the browser.

<blockquote>
  <p>As part of another private antitrust lawsuit filed against Microsoft by Sun in March, Sun sought a preliminary injunction requiring Microsoft to include a current Java virtual machine (JVM) in the Windows XP operating system.

<p>There is some fixed overhead per object. It's JVM-specific, but I usually estimate 40 bytes. Then you have to look at the members of the class. Object references are 4 (8) bytes in a 32-bit (64-bit) JVM. Primitive types are: </p>

<ul>
<li>boolean and byte: 1 byte</li>
<li>char and short: 2 bytes</li>
<li>int and float: 4 bytes</li>
<li>long and double: 8 bytes</li>

<p>Arrays follow the same rules; that is, it's an object reference so that takes 4 (or 8) bytes in your object, and then its length multiplied by the size of its element.</p>

52401,2,,52353,9/9/2008 17:22,16,,"<p>Firstly ""the size of an object"" isn't a well-defined concept in Java. You could mean the object itself, with just its members, the Object and all objects it refers to (the reference graph). You could mean the size in memory or the size on disk. And the JVM is allowed to optimise things like Strings.</p>

<p>So the only correct way is to ask the JVM, which a good profiler (I use <a href=""http://www.yourkit.com"">YourKit</a>), which probably isn't what you want.</p>

<p>However, from the description above it sounds like each row will be self-contained, and not have a big dependency tree, so the serialization method will probably be a good approximation on most JVMs. The easiest way to do this is as follows:</p>

<pre><code> Serializable ser;
 ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
 ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(baos);
 oos.writeObject(ser);
 oos.close();
 return baos.size();
</code></pre>

<p>Remember that if you have objects with common references this <em>will not</em> give the correct result, and size of serialization will not always match size in memory, but it is a good approximation. The code will be a bit more efficient if you initialise the ByteArrayOutputStream size to a sensible value.</p>

54180,2,,50255,9/10/2008 14:23,8,,"<p>Java doesn't need closures, an Object oriented language can do everything a closure does using intermediate objects to store state or do actions (in Java's case inner classes). 
But closures are desirable as a feature because they greatly simplify the code and increase readability and as a consequence the maintainability of the code.</p>

<p>I'm no Java specialist but I'm using  C# 3.5 and closures are one of my favorite features of the language, for example take the following statement as an example:</p>

<pre><code>// Example #1 with closures
public IList&lt;Customer&gt; GetFilteredCustomerList(string filter) {
    //Here a closure is created around the filter parameter
    return Customers.Where( c =&gt; c.Name.Contains(filter)).ToList();
}
</code></pre>

<p>now take an equivalent example that doesn't use closures</p>

<pre><code>//Example #2 without closures, using just basic OO techniques
public IList&lt;Customer&gt; GetFilteredCustomerList(string filter) {
    return new Customers.Where( new CustomerNameFiltrator(filter));
}
... 
public class CustomerNameFiltrator : IFilter&lt;Customer&gt; {
    private string _filter;
    public  CustomerNameFiltrator(string filter) {
         _filter = filter;
    }
    public bool Filter(Customer customer) {
        return customer.Name.Contains( _filter);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I know this is C# and not Java but the idea is the same, closures are useful for conciseness, and make code shorter and more readable. Behind the scenes, the closures of C# 3.5 do something that's looks very similar to example #2 meaning the compiler creates a private class behind the scenes and passes the 'filter' parameter to it.</p>

<p>Java doesn't need closures to work, as a developer you don't need them either, but, they are useful and provide benefits so that means that they are desirable in a language that is a production language and one of it's goals is productivity.</p>

</ul>

<p>For example, if you got its <code>keySet</code> and tried to remove an element from it, an exception would be raised. So, don't allow instances of this subclass to escape! In the snippet above, you are never passing it to another object or returning it to a caller who has a legitimate expectation that it fulfills the contract of Properties, so it is safe.</p>

<ul>
<li>The implementation of
Properties.storeToXML could change,
causing it to ignore the keySet
method.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, a future release, or OpenJDK, could use the <code>keys()</code> method of <code>Hashtable</code> instead of <code>keySet</code>. This is one of the reasons why classes should always document their ""self-use"" (Effective Java Item 15). However, in this case, the worst that would happen is that your output would revert to unsorted.</p>

methods ignore any ""default""

<p>I do agree with toby, you should instead ""point them to the S3 url.""</p>

<p>As for the OOM exception, are you sure it has to do with serving the image data?  Let's say your JVM has 256MB of ""extra"" memory to use for serving image data.  With Google's help, ""256MB / 200KB"" = 1310.  For 2GB ""extra"" memory (these days a very reasonable amount) over 10,000 simultaneous clients could be supported.  Even so, 1300 simultaneous clients is a pretty large number.  Is this the type of load you experienced?  If not, you may need to look elsewhere for the cause of the OOM exception.</p>

<p>Edit - Regarding:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this use case the images can contain sensitive data...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I read through the S3 documentation a few weeks ago, I noticed that you can generate time-expiring keys that can be attached to S3 URLs.  So, you would not have to open up the files on S3 to the public.  My understanding of the technique is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Initial HTML page has download links to your webapp</li>
<li>User clicks on a download link</li>
<li>Your webapp generates an S3 URL that includes a key that expires in, lets say, 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Send an HTTP redirect to the client with the URL from step 3.</li>
<li>The user downloads the file from S3.  This works even if the download takes more than 5 minutes - once a download starts it can continue through completion.</li>

(An instance of own app does that for 10-1000MB FLVs and MP4s.)  E.g.: No partial requests (byte range header), though.  One has to handle that 'manually', occasional down time, etc..</p>

<p>If that is not an option, John's code looks good.  I have found that a byte buffer of 2k FILEBUFFERSIZE is the most efficient in microbench marks.  Another option might be a shared FileChannel.  (FileChannels are thread-safe.)</p>

<p>That said, I'd also add that guessing at what caused an out of memory error is a classic optimization mistake.  You would improve your chances of success by working with hard metrics.</p>

<ol>
<li>Place -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError into you JVM startup parameters, just in case</li>

<p>Another important aspect of iterators has already been mentioned by Frank. There are different concepts of iterators. Java iterators correspond to C++' input iterators, i.e. they are read-only iterators that can only be incremented one step at a time and can't go backwards.</p>

Now we're getting somewhere concrete. The sort of join you're trying to do isn't really possible through the Criteria API, but a sub-query should accomplish the same thing. First you create a <code>DetachedCriteria</code> for the bonus table, then use the <code>IN</code> operator for <code>someValue</code>.</p>

<pre><code>DetachedCriteria bonuses = DetachedCriteria.forClass(Bonus.class);
List stocks = session.createCriteria(Stock.class)
    .add(Property.forName(""someValue"").in(bonuses)).list();
</code></pre>

<p>This is equivalent to</p>

<pre><code>select stock
from com.something.Stock as stock
where stock.someValue in (select bonus.id from com.something.Bonus as bonus)
</code></pre>

<p>The only downside would be if you have references to different tables in <code>someValue</code> and your ID's are not unique across all tables. But your query would suffer from the same flaw.</p>

Instead, if your application logic works on a 2-D matrix of data, fetching those via direct JDBC works better. Although Hibernate is written on top of JDBC, it has capabilities which might be non-trivial to implement in JDBC. For eg:</p>

<ol>
<li>Say, the user views a row in the UI and changes some of the values and you want to fire an update query for only those columns that did indeed change.</li>

<li>To avoid getting into deadlocks you need to maintain a global order for SQLs in a transaction. Getting this right JDBC might not be easy</li>

<li>Easily setting up optimistic locking. When you use JDBC, you need to remember to have this in every update query.</li>

58304,2,,47555,9/12/2008 4:36,7,,"<p>We use stripes now on all our production sites, and have been for about a year now. It is an awesome product compared to struts, which we used to use before that. Just the fact that there are literally no XML config files and that you can set it all up with a minimal amount of classes and annotations is awesome.</p>

<p>In terms of scaling &amp; speed it actually seems to be better than struts, and my guess would be because there are less layers involved. The code you end up with is a lot cleaner as well, because you don't have to go off to seperate XML files to find out where redirects are going.</p>

<p>We use it with an EJB3 backend, and the two seem to work really well together, because you can use your EJB POJO inside your actionBean object, without needing a form object like in struts.</p>

<p>In our evaluation we considered an alpha version of struts (that supported annotations) and a lot of other frameworks, but stripes won because of it's superior documentation, stability and clean-ness.</p>

  (Microsoft IL versus Java ByteCode),
  core system libraries, and support for

  also have a number of sizable and
  small differences, and it's beyond the

  <p>I would suggest asking a more
  targetted question about any of the
  various runtime features and component
  areas (e.g. memory management,
  compilation, system libraries,
  security, etc.) and then we can
  provide a more targetted response
  (e.g. a blog, a technical article, or

A large interface can be unruly. Also, using a focused interface in a scenario makes the code more maintanable because you can see which facet of the object is being used (e.g., an IComparable interface lets you know that the object is only being used for comparisons in the given scenario). </p>

60306,2,,60269,9/13/2008 3:33,19,,"<p>Curses! Beaten to the punch by a Google search.  Unfortunately it's true there is no easy way to create draggable tab panes (or any other components) in Swing.  So whilst the example above is complete this one I've just written is a bit simpler. So it will hopefully demonstrate the more advanced techniques involved a bit clearer.  The steps are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Detect that a drag has occurred</li>
<li>Draw the dragged tab to an offscreen buffer</li>
<li>Track the mouse position whilst dragging occurs</li>
<li>Draw the tab in the buffer on top of the component.</li>
</ol>

<p>The above example will give you what you want but if you want to really understand the techniques applied here it might be a better exercise to round off the edges of this example and add the extra features demonstrated above to it.</p>

It sounds like you've already done a little refactoring with your <code>staticInit()</code> function, but maybe that function needs to be called from the constructor, not from a static initializer.  If you can do away with static initializers period, you will be better off.  Only you can make this decision (<em>I can't see your codebase</em>) but some refactoring will definitely help.</p>

<p>As for mocking, I use EasyMock, but I have run into the same issue.  Side effects of static initializers in legacy code make testing difficult.  Our answer was to refactor out the static initializer.</p>

AFAIK, there is still no support for WPF, WCF, or WF. Mono can run on iOS, but to my knowledge, the Java runtime still runs on far more platforms than Mono.  Also, Mono is starting to see some much improved tooling (Xamarin), and Microsoft seems to have a much more cross-platform kind of attitude and willingness to work with partners to make them complimentary, rather than competitive (for example, Mono will be a pretty important part of the upcoming OWIN/Helios ASP.NET landscape).

  <li>Ease to use: Random access combined with XPath makes application easy to write</li>
  <li>Better maintainability: App code is shorter and simpler to understand.</li>
  <li>Incremental update: Occasional, small changes become very efficient.</li>
  <li>Indexing: Pre-parsed form of XML will further boost processing performance.</li>
  <li>Other features: Cut, paste, split and assemble XML documents is only possible with VTD-XML.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>An alert is a screen that shows data to the user and waits for a certain period of time before proceeding to the next Displayable. An alert can contain a text string and an image. The intended use of Alert is to inform the user about errors and other exceptional conditions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If there are two or more Commands present on the Alert, it is automatically turned into a modal Alert, and the timeout value is always FOREVER. The Alert remains on the display until a Command is invoked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are built-in classes supported in MIDP 1.0 and higher. Also your code snippet will never work. Such an API would need to block the calling thread awaiting for the user to select and answer. This goes exactly in the opposite direction of the UI interaction model of MIDP, which is based in callbacks and delegation. You need to provide your own class, implementing <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/apis/jsr118/javax/microedition/lcdui/CommandListener.html"" rel=""nofollow"">CommandListener</a>, and prepare your code for asynchronous execution.</p>

<p>Here is an (untested!) example class based on Alert:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyPrompter implements CommandListener {

	private Alert yesNoAlert;

	private Command softKey1;
	private Command softKey2;

	private boolean status;

	public MyPrompter() {
		yesNoAlert = new Alert(""Attention"");
		yesNoAlert.setString(""Are you sure?"");
		softKey1 = new Command(""No"", Command.BACK, 1);
		softKey2 = new Command(""Yes"", Command.OK, 1);
		yesNoAlert.addCommand(softKey1);
		yesNoAlert.addCommand(softKey2);
		yesNoAlert.setCommandListener(this);
		status = false;
	}

	public Displayable getDisplayable() {
		return yesNoAlert;
	}

	public boolean getStatus() {
		return status;
	}

	public void commandAction(Command c, Displayable d) {
		status = c.getCommandType() == Command.OK;
		// maybe do other stuff here. remember this is asynchronous
	}

};
</code></pre>

<p>To use it (again, untested and on top of my head):</p>

<pre><code>MyPrompter prompt = new MyPrompter();
Display.getDisplay(YOUR_MIDLET_INSTANCE).setCurrent(prompt.getDisplayable());
</code></pre>

<p>This code will make the prompt the current displayed form in your app, but it <em>won't block your thread</em> like in the example you posted. You need to continue running and wait for a commandAction invocation.</p>

<p>E.g. it is a very common operation to apply some transformation to every element in a list. This higher order function is commonly called 'map' or 'collect'. (See the *. spread operator of <a href=""http://groovy.codehaus.org/Operators"">Groovy</a>).</p>

<p>For example to square each element in a list without closures you would probably write:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; squareInts(List&lt;Integer&gt; is){
   List&lt;Integer&gt; result = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(is.size());
   for (Integer i:is)

<p>Using closures and map and the proposed syntax, you could write it like that:</p>

<pre><code>is.map({Integer i =&gt; i*i})
</code></pre>

<p>(There is a possible performance problem here regarding boxing of primitive types.)</p>

<p>As explained by Pop Catalin there is another higher order function called 'select' or 'filter': It can be used to get all the elements in a list complying to some condition. For example:</p>

<p>Instead of:</p>

<pre><code>void onlyStringsWithMoreThan4Chars(List&lt;String&gt; strings){
   List&lt;String&gt; result = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(str.size()); // should be enough
   for (String str:strings)
      if (str.length() &gt; 4) result.add(str);
   return result;
}

<p>Instead you could write something like</p>

<pre><code>strings.select({String str =&gt; str.length() &gt; 4});

<p>You might look at the Groovy syntax, which is an extension of the Java language to support closures right now. See the chapter on collections of the <a href=""http://groovy.codehaus.org/Collections"">Groovy User Guide</a> for more examples what to do with closures.</p>

<p>A remark:</p>

<p>There is perhaps some clarification needed regarding the term 'closure'. What I've shown above are strictly spoken no closures. They are just 'function objects'. 
A closure is everything which can capture - or 'close over' - the (lexical) context of the code surrounding it. In that sense there are closures in Java right now, i.e. anonymous classes:</p>

    return new Runnable(){

64063,2,,45582,9/15/2008 15:42,2,,"<p>I am not sure about what you mean about declared classes not existing between evals, the following two scripts work as expected when evaled one after another:</p>

<pre><code>class C {{println 'hi'}}
new C()
</code></pre>

<p>... </p>

<pre><code>new C()
</code></pre>

<p>However methods become bound to the class that declared them, and GroovyShell creates a new class for each instance.  If you do not need the return value of any of the scripts and they are truly scripts (not classes with main methods) you can attach the following to the end of every evaluated scrips.</p>

<pre><code>Class klass = this.getClass()
this.getMetaClass().getMethods().each {
  if (it.declaringClass.cachedClass == klass) {
    binding[it.name] = this.&amp;""$it.name""
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you depend on the return value you can hand-manage the evaluation and run the script as part of your parsing (warning, untested code follows, for illustrative uses only)...</p>

<pre><code>String scriptText = ...
Script script = shell.parse(scriptText)
def returnValue = script.run()
Class klass = script.getClass()
script.getMetaClass().getMethods().each {
  if (it.declaringClass.cachedClass == klass) {
    shell.context[it.name] = this.&amp;""$it.name""
  }
}
// do whatever with returnValue...
</code></pre>

<p>There is one last caveat I am sure you are aware of.  Statically typed variables are not kept between evals as they are not stored in the binding.  So in the previous script the variable 'klass' will not be kept between script invocations and will disappear.  To rectify that simply remove the type declarations on the first use of all variables, that means they will be read and written to the binding.</p>

64535,2,,64454,9/15/2008 16:40,1,,"<p>I recommend the web service route. It offers a standard interface that can be consumed by other client platforms in the future.</p>

<p>.NET clients interact with Java web services pretty well, though there are some gotchas. The best two technologies available for you for the .NET client are Microsoft Web Service Enhancements (WSE) and Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). WSE is an older technology that is no longer being updated by Microsoft, but still works great in Visual Studio 2005 and older. I find WSE to be a bit easier to get started with in terms of how you interface with basic services, but WCF has much more support for WS-* protocols (security, trust, etc.). If your needs are basic and you're still using Visual Studio 2005 (.NET framework 2 or older), then go with WSE. If you like the cutting edge, or you anticipate more advanced security needs (doesn't sound like you will), then go with WCF. Please note that WSE will not work easily in Visual Studio 2008 and newer, and WCF will not work in Visual Studio 2005 and older.</p>

<p>Going the web service route will mean that you will design to an interface that can be reused and will result in a more loosely coupled system when you're done than most of the other routes. The downside is primarily performance: xml serialization will be slower than binary over the wire, and web services do not handle large amounts of data well.</p>

64847,2,,63748,9/15/2008 17:19,4,,"<p>I work with graph structures in Java a lot, and my advice would be to make any data member of the Node and Edge class that the Graph depends on for maintaining its structure final, with no setters. In fact, if you can, I would make Node and Edge completely immutable, which has <a href=""http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=29"" rel=""nofollow"">many benefits</a>.</p>

<p>So, for example:</p>

<pre><code>public final class Node {

    private final String name;

    public Node(String name) {
           this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() { return name; }
    // note: no setter for name
}
</code></pre>

<p>You would then do your uniqueness check in the Graph object:</p>

<pre><code>public class Graph {
    Set&lt;Node&gt; nodes = new HashSet&lt;Node&gt;();
    public void addNode(Node n) {
        // note: this assumes you've properly overridden 
        // equals and hashCode in Node to make Nodes with the 
        // same name .equal() and hash to the same value.
        if(nodes.contains(n)) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Already in graph: "" + node);
        }
        nodes.add(n);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to modify a name of a node, remove the old node and add a new one. This might sound like extra work, but it saves a lot of effort keeping everything straight.</p>

<p>Really, though, creating your own Graph structure from the ground up is probably unnecessary -- this issue is only the first of many you are likely to run into if you build your own.</p>

<p>I would recommend finding a good open source Java graph library, and using that instead. Depending on what you are doing, there are a few options out there. I have used <a href=""http://jung.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">JUNG</a> in the past, and would recommend it as a good starting point.</p>

<p>Do you really want to expose a setName() method on Node at all?  There's nothing in your example to suggest that you need that.  If you make both your Node and Edge classes immutable, most of the integrity-violation scenarios you're envisioning become impossible.  (If you need them to be mutable but only until they're added to a Graph, you could enforce this by having an isInGraph flag on your Node/Edge classes that is set to true by Graph.Add{Node, Edge}, and have your mutators throw an exception if called after this flag is set.)</p>

<p>I agree with jhkiley that passing Node objects to the Edge constructor (instead of Strings) sounds like a good idea.</p>

<p>If you want a more intrusive approach, you could have a pointer from the Node class back to the Graph it resides in, and update the Graph if any critical properties (e.g., the name) of the Node ever change.  But I wouldn't do that unless you're sure you need to be able to change the names of existing Nodes while preserving Edge relationships, which seems unlikely.</p>

65531,2,,65475,9/15/2008 18:41,7,,"<p>Every programming language has its own set of rules and conventions for the kinds of names that you're allowed to use, and the Java programming language is no different. The rules and conventions for naming your variables can be summarized as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Variable names are case-sensitive. A variable's name can be any legal identifier — an unlimited-length sequence of Unicode letters and digits, beginning with a letter, the dollar sign ""$"", or the underscore character ""_"". The convention, however, is to always begin your variable names with a letter, not ""$"" or ""_"". Additionally, the dollar sign character, by convention, is never used at all. You may find some situations where auto-generated names will contain the dollar sign, but your variable names should always avoid using it. A similar convention exists for the underscore character; while it's technically legal to begin your variable's name with ""_"", this practice is discouraged. White space is not permitted.</p></li>
<li><p>Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscore characters. Conventions (and common sense) apply to this rule as well. When choosing a name for your variables, use full words instead of cryptic abbreviations. Doing so will make your code easier to read and understand. In many cases it will also make your code self-documenting; fields named cadence, speed, and gear, for example, are much more intuitive than abbreviated versions, such as s, c, and g. Also keep in mind that the name you choose must not be a keyword or reserved word.</p></li>
<li><p>If the name you choose consists of only one word, spell that word in all lowercase letters. If it consists of more than one word, capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word. The names gearRatio and currentGear are prime examples of this convention. If your variable stores a constant value, such as <code>static final int NUM_GEARS = 6</code>, the convention changes slightly, capitalizing every letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore character. By convention, the underscore character is never used elsewhere. </p></li>

<p>As you can see, each iteration is having to copy one more character, resulting in us performing 1+2+3+4+5+...+N operations each loop.  This is an O(n^2) operation. If however we knew in advance that we only needed N characters, we could do it in a single allocation, with copy of just N characters from the strings we were using - a mere O(n) operation.</p>

<p>StringBuffer/StringBuilder avoid this because they are mutable, and so do not need to keep copying the same data over and over (so long as there is space to copy into in their internal buffer).  They avoid performing an allocation and copy proportional to the number of appends done by over-allocing their buffer by a proportion of its current size, giving amortized O(1) appending.</p>

Instead:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have access to Java 5+, use enums to define your specific constants for an application area.  All parts of the application area should refer to enums, not constant values, for these constants.  You may declare an enum similar to how you declare a class.  Enums are perhaps the most (and, arguably, only) useful feature of Java 5+.</li>
<li>If you have constants that are only valid to a particular class or one of its subclasses, declare them as either protected or public and place them on the top class in the hierarchy.  This way, the subclasses can access these constant values (and if other classes access them via public, the constants aren't only valid to a particular class...which means that the external classes using this constant may be too tightly coupled to the class containing the constant)</li>
<li>If you have an interface with behavior defined, but returned values or argument values should be particular, it is perfectly acceptible to define constants on that interface so that other implementors will have access to them.  However, avoid creating an interface just to hold constants: it can become just as bad as a class created just to hold constants.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the constants are strongly tied to
  an existing class or interface, you
  should add them to the class or
  interface. For example, all of the
  boxed numerical primitive classes,
  such as Integer and Double, export
  MIN_VALUE and MAX_VALUE constants. If
  the constants are best viewed as
  members of an enumerated type, you
  should export them with an <strong>enum</strong>
  type. Otherwise, you should export the
  constants with a noninstantiable
  utility class.</p>

<p>Other things to look for: your sequencing size. A lot of the time spent writing objects in TopLink is actually spent reading sequencing information from the database, especially with the small defaults (I would probably have several hundred or even more as my sequence size).</p>

71496,2,,62398,9/16/2008 11:48,2,,"<p>From using third party libraries on Windows I've learned the following two things:</p>

<p>Try to distribute your library as a DLL rather than a static library. This gives way better compatibility between different c compilers and linkers. Another problem with static libraries in visual c++ is that the choice of runtime library can make libraries incompatible with code using a different runtime library and you may end up needing to distribute one version of the library for each runtime library.</p>

<p>Avoid c++ if possible. The c++ name mangling differs alot between different compilers and it's unlikely that a library built for visual c++ will be possible to link from another build environment in windows. When it comes to C, things are much better, in particular if you use dll's.</p>

<p>If you really want to get the good parts of c++ (such as resource management through constructors and destructors), build a convenience layer in c++ that you distribute as source code that hides away your c functions. Since the user has the source and compiles it locally, it won't have any name mangiling or abi issues with the local environment.</p>

<p>Without knowing too much about calling c/c++ code from Java, I expect it to be way easier to work with c code than c++ code because of the name mangling issues.</p>

<ol>
<li>Use JNI and crash in the native code.</li>
<li>If no security manager is installed you can use reflection to crash the VM. This is VM specific, but normally a VM stores a bunch of pointers to native resources in private fields (e.g. a pointer to the native thread object is stored in a long field in <strong>java.lang.Thread</strong>). Just change them via reflection and the VM will crash sooner or later.</li>
<li>All VMs have bugs, so you just have to trigger one.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the last method I have a short example, which will crash a Sun Hotspot VM quiet nicely:</p>

<pre><code>public class Crash {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object[] o = null;

<p>Typical crashes in machine code happen by dereferencing pointers to wrong memory areas (null address or missaligned. Another source could be illegal machine instructions (opcodes) or unhandled signals from library or kernel calls.</p>

<p>JVMs (the native code) can have bugs. For example JITed (generated) code, native methods or system calls (graphics driver) can have problems leading to real crashes. In those cases the crash handler of the JVM kicks in and dumps the state. It could also generate a OS core file (Dr. Watson on Windows and core dump on *nix).</p>

<p>On Linux/Unix you can easyly make a JVM crash by sending it a Signal to the running process. Note: you should not use <code>SIGSEGV</code> for this, since Hotspot catches this signal and re-throws it as a NullPointerException in most places. So it is better to send a <code>SIGBUS</code> for example.</p>

<p>A warning about gSOAP linking though: you can never use more than one WSDL in a single link object (executable, dll, shared object).  This is because some of the generated WSDL-specific functions have general names (e.g. soap_getfault()).</p>

<p>Worse, with Unix ELF linking, these names will cause cross-linking between shared objects, so a FooService fault might be processed by the soap_getfault() for BarService, corrupting memory if the fault detail structures are different.</p>

<p>The workaround for that is to make sure that nothing gSOAP-related is exposed outside the SO they are linked into.  This can be solved by giving gcc these definitions _both when linking the gSOAP library itself and linking your code:</p>

<pre><code>#define SOAP_FMAC2  __attribute__ ((visibility (""hidden"")))
#define SOAP_FMAC4  __attribute__ ((visibility (""hidden"")))
#define SOAP_FMAC6  __attribute__ ((visibility (""hidden"")))
#define SOAP_NMAC   __attribute__ ((visibility (""hidden"")))

<p>Alternately, you might consider using Workspace Manager.

Essentially, you can create a workspace, which in your case would be roughly equivalent to a named transaction.

<p>As for Restlet, I can tell you that I've been very impressed with the developers and the community; they're very active, engaged, responsive, and committed to a stable, efficient, reliable, and effective framework. My single favorite aspect of the framework is that it is a ground-up implementation of the REST paradigm; therefore there is no impedance-mismatch between a Restlet app's external API and internal implementation. I also really like how flexible it is - it can run inside a Java application container/server such as JBoss, Tomcat, Jetty, etc, or standalone, with an embedded HTTP server library.</p>

<a href=""http://www.xquery.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xquery.com</a></p>

<p>XQuery is a query language that was designed as a native XML query language. Because most types of data can be represented as XML, XQuery can also be used to query other types of data. For example, XQuery can be used to query relational data using an XML view of a relational database. This is important because many Internet applications need to integrate information from multiple sources, including data found in web messages, relational data, and various XML sources. XQuery was specifically designed for this kind of data integration.</p>

<p>For example, suppose your company is a financial institution that needs to produce reports of stock holdings for each client. A client requests a report with a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) message, which is represented in XML. In most businesses, the stock holdings data is stored in multiple relational databases, such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, or DB2. XQuery can query both the SOAP message and the relational databases, creating a report in XML.</p>

<p>XQuery is based on the structure of XML and leverages that structure to make it possible to perform queries on any type of data that can be represented as XML, including relational data. In addition, XQuery API for Java (XQJ) lets your queries run in any environment that supports the J2EE platform.</p>

<p>This rather silly loop goes through a sequence (using forward iterator semantics only), printing each contiguous subsequence of 3 elements exactly once (and a couple shorter subsequences at the end).  But supposing N elements, and M elements per line instead of 3, this algorithm would still be O(N*M) iterator increments, and O(1) space.</p>

<p>The Java style iterators lack the ability to store position independently.  You will either</p>

<ul>
<li>lose O(1) space, using (for example) an array of size M to store history as you iterate</li>
<li>will need to traverse the list N times, making O(N^2+N*M) time</li>
<li>or use a concrete Array type with GetAt member function, losing genericism and the ability to use linked list container types.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since only forward iteration mechanics were used in this example, i was able to swap in a list with <a href=""http://codepad.org/aRsFuoA4"">no problems</a>.  This is critical to authoring generic algorithms, such as search, delayed initialization and evaluation, sorting, etc.</p>

177758,2,,53623,10/7/2008 9:34,1,,"<p>Thomas' answer will only work if you know <em>which</em> ""whois"" server to connect to.</p>

<p>There are many different ways of finding that out, but none (AFAIK) that works uniformly for every domain registry.</p>

<p>Some domain names support an <code>SRV</code> record for the <code>_nicname._tcp</code> service in the DNS, but there are issues with that because there's no accepted standard yet on how to prevent a subdomain from serving up <code>SRV</code> records which override those of the official registry (see <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sanz-whois-srv-00"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sanz-whois-srv-00</a>).</p>

<p>For many TLDs it's possible to send your query to <code>&lt;tld&gt;.whois-servers.net</code>.  This actually works quite well, but beware that it won't work in all cases where there are officially delegated second level domains.</p>

<p>For example in <code>.uk</code> there are several official sub-domains, but only some of them are run by the <code>.uk</code> registry and the others have their own WHOIS services and those aren't in the <code>whois-servers.net</code> database.</p>

<p>Confusingly there are also ""unofficial"" registries, such as <code>.uk.com</code>, which <em>are</em> in the <code>whois-servers.net</code> database.</p>

<p>p.s. the official End-Of-Line delimiter in WHOIS, as with most IETF protocols is <code>CRLF</code>, not just <code>LF</code>.</p>

I did not test your code, but you should never need to force the initialization of proxies, the property accessors do that for you. If you are using Hibernate explicitly, never mind using JPA, since you already have lost portability.</p>

<p>Hibernate should detect automatically whenever it needs to fetch or write to db. If you issue a getProperty() from a proxy, hibernate or any other jpa provider should fetch the correspondent row from the db.</p>

<p>Strings are immutable types. You cannot modify them, only return new string instances.</p>

<p>Because of that, ""foo"".format() makes little sense, as it would have to be called like</p>

<pre><code>string newString = ""foo"".format();
</code></pre>

<p>The original java authors (and .NET authors), decided that a static method made more sense in this situation, as you are not modifying ""foo"", but instead calling a format method and passing in an input string.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Heh, this site can be so amusing sometimes. I got downvoted for mentioning the fact that strings are immutable types.</p>

<p>Here is an example of why Format() would be dumb as an instance method. In .NET (and probably in Java), Replace() is an instance method.</p>

<p>You can do this:</p>

<pre><code> ""I Like Wine"".Replace(""Wine"",""Beer"");
</code></pre>

<p>However, nothing happens, because Strings are immutable. Replace tries to return a new string, but it is assigned to nothing.</p>

<p>This causes lots of common rookie mistakes like:</p>

<pre><code>// Contrived Example
inputText.Replace("" "",""%20"");
</code></pre>

<p>Again, nothing happens, instead you have to do :</p>

<pre><code>inputText = inputText.Replace("" "",""%20"");
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if you understand that strings are immutable, that makes perfect sense. If you don't, then you are just confused. The proper place for Replace, would be where Format is, as a static method of String:</p>

<pre><code> inputText = String.Replace(inputText,"" "", ""%20"");
</code></pre>

<p>Now there is no question as to whats going on.</p>

<p>The real question is, why did the authors of these frameworks decide that one should be an instance method, and the other static? In my opinion, both are more elegantly expressed as static methods, but erickson seems to think both belong as instance methods.</p>

<p>Regardless of your opinion, the truth is that you are less prone to make a mistake using the static version, and the code is easier to understand (No Hidden Gotchas).</p>

<p>Of course there are some methods that are perfect as instance methods, take String.Length()</p>

<pre><code>int length = ""123"".Length();
</code></pre>

<p>In this situation, its obvious we are not trying to modify ""123"", we just inspecting it, and returning its length...This is a perfect candidate for an instance method.</p>

<p>My simple rules for Instance Methods on Immutable Objects:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you need to return a new instance of the same type, use a static method.</li>
<li>Otherwise, use an instance method.</li>
</ul>

303081,2,,56687,11/19/2008 19:39,1,,"<p>Summary of the long answer below: to solve the problem that I had (restricting server and callback ports at either end of the RMI connection), I needed to create two pairs of client and server socket factories.</p>

<p>Longer answer ensues:</p>

<p>Our solution to the callback problem had essentially three parts.  The first was the object wrapping which needed the ability to specify that it was being used for a client to server connection vs. being used for a server to client callback.  Using an extension of <code>UnicastRemoteObject</code> gave us the ability to specify the client and server socket factories that we wanted to use.  However, the best place to lock down the socket factories is in the constructor of the remote object.  </p>

<pre><code>public class RemoteObjectWrapped extends UnicastRemoteObject {
// ....
private RemoteObjectWrapped(final boolean callback) throws RemoteException {
  super((callback ? RemoteConnectionParameters.getCallbackPort() : RemoteConnectionParameters.getServerSidePort()),
        (callback ? CALLBACK_CLIENT_SOCKET_FACTORY : CLIENT_SOCKET_FACTORY),
        (callback ? CALLBACK_SERVER_SOCKET_FACTORY : SERVER_SOCKET_FACTORY));
}
// ....
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, the first argument specifies the part on which the object is expecting requests, whereas the second and third specify the socket factories that will be used at either end of the connection driving this remote object.</p>

<p>Since we wanted to restrict the ports used by the connection, we needed to extend the RMI socket factories and lock down the ports.  Here are some sketches of our server and client factories:</p>

<pre><code>public class SpecifiedServerSocketFactory implements RMIServerSocketFactory {
/** Always use this port when specified. */
private int serverPort;
/**
 * @param ignoredPort This port is ignored.  
 * @return a {@link ServerSocket} if we managed to create one on the correct port.
 * @throws java.io.IOException
 */
@Override
public ServerSocket createServerSocket(final int ignoredPort) throws IOException {
    try {
        final ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(this.serverPort);
        return serverSocket;
    } catch (IOException ioe) {
        throw new IOException(""Failed to open server socket on port "" + serverPort, ioe);
    }
}
// ....
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the server socket factory above ensures that only the port that you previously specified will ever be used by this factory.  The client socket factory has to be paired with the appropriate socket factory (or you'll never connect).</p>

<pre><code>public class SpecifiedClientSocketFactory implements RMIClientSocketFactory, Serializable {
/** Serialization hint */
public static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
/** This is the remote port to which we will always connect. */
private int remotePort;
/** Storing the host just for reference. */
private String remoteHost = ""HOST NOT YET SET"";
// ....
/**
 * @param host The host to which we are trying to connect
 * @param ignoredPort This port is ignored.  
 * @return A new Socket if we managed to create one to the host.
 * @throws java.io.IOException
 */
@Override
public Socket createSocket(final String host, final int ignoredPort) throws IOException {
    try {
        final Socket socket = new Socket(host, remotePort);
        this.remoteHost = host;
        return socket;
    } catch (IOException ioe) {
        throw new IOException(""Failed to open a socket back to host "" + host + "" on port "" + remotePort, ioe);
    }
}
// ....
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, the only thing remaining to force your two way connection to stay on the same set of ports is some logic to recognize that you are calling back to the client-side.  In that situation, just make sure that your factory method for the remote object calls the RemoteObjectWrapper constructor up top with the callback parameter set to true.</p>

I have some experience with Eclipse (~4 months developing RCP) and now Netbeans (played around for a couple of days). IMHO these frameworks are too complicated. You just end up debugging into Eclipse-specific plugin loaders trying to figure out why you get a ClassNotFoundException or a NullPointer. The same story with NetBeans: somehow somewhere somewhat reads out xml config files and creates UI from that, cool, as long as you follow the tutorial. And of course you can't develop and Eclipse-based RCP using some other IDE, NB is also very jealous about its usage (unless you do some hacks like I did).
What I'm lacking is a clear way to debug my threads from main to action performed. Instead I'm always told what I have to do to avoid exceptions. And so I have to keep my fingers crossed each time I'm trying to pull something new. And it never works out the first time.
Now I thought about the features I need and I looked out for smaller projects that aim at specific functionality like plugin management eg. And there are plenty. Just compile a list of the functionality you need and start adding smaller frameworks by integrating them into your project. This also makes sense since your project should consume less RAM in the end.</p>

447845,2,,45424,1/15/2009 18:15,1,,"<p>My solution would involve one interface and one interceptor.  You implement the following interface for all actions <strong>to which</strong> you are likely to want to redirect:</p>

<pre><code>public interface TargetAware {
  public String getTarget();
  public void setTarget(String target);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The interceptor simply ensures that the target is set, if required:</p>

<pre><code>public class SetTargetInterceptor extends MethodFilterInterceptor implements Interceptor {
   public String doIntercept(ActionInvocation invocation) {
      Object action = invocation.getAction();
      HttpServletRequest request = (HttpServletRequest) invocation.getInvocationContext().get(StrutsStatics.HTTP_REQUEST);
      if (action instanceof TargetAware) {
         TargetAware targetAwareAction = (TargetAware) action;
         if (targetAwareAction.getTarget() == null)
            targetAwareAction.setTarget(getCurrentUri(request));
      } 	
      return invocation.invoke();
   }

   // I'm sure we can find a better implementation of this...
   private static String getCurrentUri(HttpServletRequest request) {
      String uri = request.getRequestURI();
      String queryString = request.getQueryString();
      if (queryString != null &amp;&amp; !queryString.equals(""""))
         uri += ""?"" + queryString;
      return uri;
   }

   public void init() { /* do nothing */ }
   public void destroy() { /* do nothing */ }
}
</code></pre>

<p>From then on, once these two bits are in place and your actions implement the <code>TargetAware</code> interface (if you expect to have to redirect to them), then you have access to a <code>target</code> parameter in your JSPs whenever you need it.  Pass that parameter on to your <code>VisualizationAction</code> (which might as well implement also the <code>TargetAware</code> interface!), and on <code>SUCCESS</code>, redirect as explained by Vincent Ramdhanie:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;action name=""Visual"" class=""it.___.web.actions.VisualizationAction""&gt;
   &lt;result type=""redirect""&gt;
      &lt;param name=""location""&gt;${target}&lt;/param&gt;
      &lt;param name=""parse""&gt;true&lt;/param&gt;
   &lt;/result&gt;
&lt;/action&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I did not try every single detail of this strategy.  In particular, beware of the notation surrounding the <code>redirect</code> result type (depending on your specific version of Struts2: 2.0.x and 2.1.x may differ on this...).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Performance. Java and .Net have similar performance level due to the virtual machine, but JVM normally has better performance because of years and years optimization.</p></li>
<li><p>Library. Although this depends on your task, Java has much more open source or third party libraries available there. For server App, J2EE, Spring, Struts, etc. For GUI, although .Net provides Win32 layer API but this causes compatibility issues. Java has Swing, SWT, AWT, etc. It works in most cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibility. This is the key issues that need to be considered when develop the cross-platform program. Two issue: first, platform compatibility. Java still wins since JDK is well maintained by single and original company Sun. Mono is not maintained by MS, so you have no guarantee yet for update compatibility. 2. Backward compatibility. Sun maintains a good reputation on their backward compatibility, although sometimes this seems too rigid and slows the pace.</p></li>
<li><p>Tools. Java has good cross-platform IDEs. Netbeans, Eclipse, etc. Most of them are free. VS Studio is good but only on Windows, and not cost a bit. Both of them provides good unit tests, debugs, profiles, etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hence I'd suggest that Java is a better choice. As a show case, there are some famous desktop cross-platforms apps developed by Java: Vuze, Limewire, BlogBridge, CrossFTP, not to mention those IDEs. As to .Net, I have limited knowledge on such success apps.</p>

628785,2,,54886,3/10/2009 3:01,120,,"<h1>Ctrl-2 something</h1>

<p>Seems that nobody mentioned Ctrl-2 L (assign to new local variable) and Ctrl-2 F (assign to a new field), these ones have changed how I write code.</p>

<p>Previously, I was typing, say (| is cursor location):</p>

<pre><code>Display display = new |
</code></pre>

<p>and then I pushed Ctrl-Space to complete the constructor call. Now I type:</p>

<pre><code>new Display()|
</code></pre>

<p>and press Ctrl-2 L, which results in:</p>

<pre><code>Display display = new Display()|
</code></pre>

<p>This really speeds things up. (Ctrl-2 F does the same, but assigns to a new field rather than a new variable.)</p>

<p>Another good shortcut is Ctrl-2 R: rename in file. It is much faster than rename refactoring (Alt-Shift-R) when renaming things like local variables.</p>

<p>Actually I went to Keys customization preference page and assigned all sorts of additional quick fixes to Ctrl-2-something. For example I now press Ctrl-2 J to split/join variable declaration, Ctrl-2 C to extract an inner class into top-level, Ctrl-2 T to add throws declaration to the function, etc. There are tons of assignable quick fixes, go pick your favourite ones and assign them to Ctrl-2 shortcuts.</p>

<h1>Templates</h1>

<p>Another favourite of mine in my “npe” template, defined as:</p>

<pre><code>if (${arg:localVar} == null)
    throw new ${exception:link(NullPointerException,IllegalArgumentException)}(""${arg:localVar} is null"");
</code></pre>

<p>This allows me to quickly add null argument checks at the start of every function (especially ones that merely save the argument into a field or add it into a collection, especially constructors), which is great for detecting bugs early.</p>

<p>See more useful templates at <a href=""http://www.tarantsov.com/eclipse/templates/"" rel=""nofollow"">www.tarantsov.com/eclipse/templates/</a>. I won't list them all here because there are many, and because I often add new ones.</p>

<h1>Completion</h1>

<p>A few code completion tricks:</p>

<ul>
<li>camel case support mentioned in another answer: type cTM, get currentTimeMillis</li>
<li>default constructor: in the class declaration with no default constructor push Ctrl-Space, the first choice will be to create one</li>
<li>overloading: in the class declaration start typing name of a method you can overload, Ctrl-Space, pick one</li>
<li>getter/setter creation: type “get”, Ctrl-Space, choose a getter to create; same with “is” and “set”</li>
</ul>

<h1>Assign To A New Field</h1>

<p>This is how I add fields.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you have no constructors yet, add one. (Ctrl-Space anywhere in a class declaration, pick the first proposal.)</p></li>
<li><p>Add an argument (| is cursor position):</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass {
    public MyClass(int something|) {
    }
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Press Ctrl-1, choose “assign to a new field”. You get:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass {
    private final Object something;
    public MyClass(Object something) {
        this.something = something;
    }
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Add a null-pointer check if appropriate (see “npe” template above):</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass {
    private final Object something;
    public MyClass(Object something) {
        npe|
        this.something = something;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hit Ctrl-Space, get:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass {
    private final Object something;
    public MyClass(Object something) {
        if (something == null)
            throw new NullPointerException(""something is null"");
        this.something = something;
    }
}
</code></pre></li>

  <p>I've been reading a lot lately about the next release of Java possibly supporting closures. I feel like I have a pretty firm grasp on what closures are, but I can't think of a solid example of how they would make an Object-Oriented language ""better.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, most people who use the term ""closure"" actually mean ""function object"", and in this sense, function objects make it possible to write simpler code in certain circumstances such as when you need custom comparators in a sort function.  </p>

<p>For example, in Python:</p>

<pre><code>def reversecmp(x, y):
   return y - x

a = [4, 2, 5, 9, 11]
a.sort(cmp=reversecmp)
</code></pre>

<p>This sorts the list a in reverse order by passing the custom comparison functoin reversecmp.  The addition of the lambda operator makes things even more compact:</p>

<pre><code>a = [4, 2, 5, 9, 11]
a.sort(cmp=lambda x, y : y - x)
</code></pre>

<p>Java does not have function objects, so it uses ""functor classes"" to simulate them.  In Java you do the equivalent operation by implementing a custom version of the Comparator class, and passing that to the sort function:</p>

<pre><code>class ReverseComparator implements Comparator {
   public compare(Object x, Object y) {
      return (Integer) y - (Integer) x;
   }

...

List&lt;Integer&gt; a = Arrays.asList(4, 2, 5, 9, 11);
Collections.sort(a, new ReverseComparator());
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, it gives the same effect as closures, but is clumsier and more verbose.  However, the addition of anonymous inner classes obviates most of the pain:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; a = Arrays.asList(4, 2, 5, 9, 11);
Comparator reverse = new Comparator() {
   public Compare(Object x, Object y) {
       return (Integer) y - (Integer) x;
   }
}
Collections.sort(a, reverse);
</code></pre>

<p>So I would say that the combination of functor classes + anonymous inner classes in Java is sufficient to compensate for the lack of true function objects, making their addition unnecessary.</p>
",42076,,,,,4/4/2009 7:28,,,,1,,,
716763,2,,50255,4/4/2009 8:23,61,,"<p>As a Lisp programmer I would wish that the Java community understands the following difference: <strong>functions as objects vs. closures</strong>.</p>

<p>a) <strong>functions can be named or anonymous</strong>. But they can also be objects of themselves. This allows functions to be passed around as arguments, returned from functions or stored in data structures. This means that functions are first class objects in a programming language.</p>

<p>Anonymous functions don't add much to the language, they just allow you to write functions in a shorter way.</p>

<p>b) <strong>A closure is a function plus a binding environment</strong>. closures can be passed <em>downwards</em> (as parameters) or returned <em>upwards</em> (as return values). This allows the function to refer to variables of its environment, even if the surrounding code is no longer active.</p>

<p>If you have a) in some language, then the question comes up what to do about b)? There are languages that have a), but not b). In the functional programming world a (functions) and b (functions as closures) is nowadays the norm. Smalltalk had a) (<em>blocks</em> are anonymous functions) for a long time, but then some dialects of Smalltalk added support for b) (blocks as closures).</p>

<p>You can imagine that you get a slightly different programming model if you add functions and closures to the language. </p>

<p>From a pragmatic view the anonymous function adds some short notation where you pass or invoke functions. That can be a good thing.</p>

<p>The closure (function plus binding) allows you for example to create a function that has access to some variables (for example to a counter value). Now you can store that function in an object, access it and invoke it. The context for the function object is now not only the objects it has access to, but also the variables it has access to via bindings. This is also useful, but you can see that variable bindings vs. access to object variables now is an issue: when should be something a <em>lexical</em> variable (that can be accessed in a closure) and when should it be a variable of some object (a <code>slot</code>). When should something be a closure or an object? You can use both in the similar ways. A usual programming exercise for students learning Scheme (a Lisp dialect) is to write a simple object system using closures.</p>

<p>The result is a more complicated programming language and a more complicated runtime model. Too complicated?</p>

716783,2,,50255,4/4/2009 8:44,2,,"<p>Closures in an imperative language (examples: JavaScript, C#, the forthcoming C++ refresh) are not the same as anonymous inner classes. They need to be able to capture modifiable references to local variables. Java's inner classes can only capture local <code>final</code> variables.</p>

<p>Almost any language feature can be criticised as non-essential:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>do</code> are all just syntactic sugar over <code>goto</code>/<code>if</code>.</li>
<li>Inner classes are syntactic sugar over classes with a field pointing to the outer class.</li>

716804,2,,50255,4/4/2009 9:07,3,,"<p>A few people have said, or implied, that closures are just syntactic sugar - doing what you could already do with anonymous inner classes and making it more convenient to pass parameters in.</p>

<p>They <em>are</em> syntactic sugar in the same sense that Java is syntactic sugar for assembler (that ""assembler"" could be bytecode, for sake of argument). In other words they raise they level of abstraction, and this is an important concept.</p>

<p>Closures promote the concept of the function-as-object to a first class entity - one that increases the expressiveness of code, rather than cluttering it with even more boilerplate.</p>

<p>An example that's close to my heart has already been mentioned by Tom Hawtin - implementing the Execute Around idiom, which is just about the only way to get RAII into Java. <a href=""http://www.levelofindirection.com/journal/2009/9/24/raii-and-closures-in-java.html"" rel=""nofollow"">I wrote a blog entry on exactly that subject</a> a couple of years ago when I first heard closures might be coming.</p>

<p>Ironically, I think the very reason that closures would be good for Java (more expressiveness with less code) may be what rattles many Java advocates. Java has a mindset of ""spell everything out the long way"". That and the fact that closures are a nod towards a more functional way of doing things - which I also see as a Good Thing, but may water down the pure OO message that many in the Java community hold dear.</p>

RCP is rock solid and consistent, modular and very flexible. Once you master it, you get huge benefits. Being a platform it give you the most commonly used things - preference, configurations, automatic updates, layout management, branding and things like that. You build a product, not an app. But learning curve is pretty steep in the beginning.</p>

<p>Swing on the other hand is not a platform, you will re-invent the wheel by writing your own things I mentioned above. But yes, swing is faster to learn and get started. I think it fits better for smaller applications with shorter life span.</p>

I've found that when using Gmail as an outbound SMTP server for my webapp, Gmail only lets me send ~10 or so messages before responding with an anti-spam response that I have to manually step through to re-enable SMTP access.  The emails I was sending were not spam, but were website ""welcome"" emails when users registered with my system.  So, YMMV, and I wouldn't rely on Gmail for a production webapp.  If you're sending email on a user's behalf, like an installed desktop app (where the user enters their own Gmail credentials), you may be okay.</p>

<p>Also, if you're using Spring, here's a working config to use Gmail for outbound SMTP:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id=""mailSender"" class=""org.springframework.mail.javamail.JavaMailSenderImpl""&gt;

Sun wanted too much money for what Jini brought to the table compared to other alternatives.  I would love to hear from folks that disagree!

1688974,2,,55375,11/6/2009 17:10,19,,"<p>You're going the wrong way: a subclass of an enum would have <em>fewer</em> entries.</p>

<p>In pseudocode, think:</p>

<pre><code>enum Animal { Mosquito, Dog, Cat };
enum Mammal : Animal { Dog, Cat };  // (not valid C#)
</code></pre>

<p>Any method that can accept an Animal should be able to accept a Mammal, but not the other way around.  Subclassing is for making something more specific, not more general.  That's why ""object"" is the root of the class hierarchy.  Likewise, if enums were inheritable, then a hypothetical root of the enum hierarchy would have every possible symbol.</p>

<p>But no, C#/Java don't allow sub-enums, AFAICT, though it would be really useful at times.  It's probably because they chose to implement Enums as ints (like C) instead of interned symbols (like Lisp).  (Above, what does (Animal)1 represent, and what does (Mammal)1 represent, and are they the same value?)</p>

<p>If you still want to create such solution manually you can just create JMS connection in your Ajax servlet (connection per request). Consider using Spring JMS template for that reason ( <a href=""http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jms.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jms.html</a> ). Then just receive the message in the Servlet doGet/doPost method. Consider low timeout value for receiving in that case. Such solution will work for the Queues and durable Topics.</p>

<p>For non-durable Topics consider external message listener. Spring <code>MessageListenerContainer</code> is an excellent tool for that purpose:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean class=""org.springframework.jms.listener.DefaultMessageListenerContainer
   &lt;property name=""connectionFactory"" ref=""jmsFactory""/&gt;
   &lt;property name=""destination"" ref=""myTopic"" /&gt;
   &lt;property name=""messageListener"" ref=""lastTenUpdatesCache"" /&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Bean <code>lastTenUpdatesCache</code> will be a singleton bean implementing <code>MesssageListener</code>. This bean would be responsible for caching last ten messages (just putting it into a java.util list). It will be injected into your Ajax servlet so in your doGet/doPost method you can ask it about last 10 messages sent to the topic.</p>

My opinion is that English is the language of the realm, and even if you name your variables in a different language, there is little to no point to use any non-ASCII characters in your programming. Leave it up to the language to deal with it if you are handling data that is UTF8: my iPhone program (which involves tons of user data going in between the phone and server) has full UTF8 support, but has no UTF8 in the source code.

In version 1.5 (which is supposd to be compatible with Sun's v1.5), I had problems compiling using generics, and finally gave up and moved to Sun's JDK.</p>

<p>I must say, any difference in performance was negligible (for my purposes, YMMV) and really the solution for installation issues is to create an installer for your app. Reverse engineering a binary isn't really all that harder than reverse engineering bytecode. Use an obfuscator if it is that important.</p>

<p>Overall, I think the compatibility problems involved in using GCJ greatly outweighs any gains (which I think questionable at best) you might possible derive from it. Try compiling parts of your app in gcj and see how it goes though. If it works out fine, otherwise you get something solid to pitch to your boss.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Delegates are a useful construct in event-based systems. Essentially
  Delegates are objects that encode a method dispatch on a specified
  object. This document shows how java inner classes provide a more
  generic solution to such problems.</p>
  
  <p>What is a Delegate? Really it is very similar to a pointer to member
  function as used in C++. But a delegate contains the target object
  alongwith the method to be invoked. Ideally it would be nice to be
  able to say:</p>
  
  <p>obj.registerHandler(ano.methodOne); </p>
  
  <p>..and that the method methodOne would be called on ano when some specific event was received.</p>
  
  <p>This is what the Delegate structure achieves.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Java Inner Classes</strong> </p>
  
  <p>It has been argued that Java provides this
  functionality via inner classes and thus does not need the additional
  Delegate construct.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>obj.registerHandler(new Handler() {
        public void handleIt(Event ev) {
            methodOne(ev);
        }
      } );
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>At first glance this seems correct but at the same time a nuisance.
  Because for many event processing examples the simplicity of the
  Delegates syntax is very attractive.</p>
  
  <p><strong>General Handler</strong> </p>
  
  <p>However, if event-based programming is used in a more
  pervasive manner, say, for example, as a part of a general
  asynchronous programming environment, there is more at stake.</p>
  
  <p>In such a general situation, it is not sufficient to include only the
  target method and target object instance. In general there may be
  other parameters required, that are determined within the context when
  the event handler is registered.</p>
  
  <p>In this more general situation, the java approach can provide a very
  elegant solution, particularly when combined with use of final
  variables:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>void processState(final T1 p1, final T2 dispatch) { 
  final int a1 = someCalculation();

  m_obj.registerHandler(new Handler() {
    public void handleIt(Event ev) {
     dispatch.methodOne(a1, ev, p1);
    }
  } );
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>final * final * final</strong> </p>
  
  <p>Got your attention?</p>
  
  <p>Note that the final variables are accessible from within the anonymous
  class method definitions. Be sure to study this code carefully to
  understand the ramifications. This is potentially a very powerful
  technique. For example, it can be used to good effect when registering
  handlers in MiniDOM and in more general situations.</p>
  
  <p>By contrast, the Delegate construct does not provide a solution for
  this more general requirement, and as such should be rejected as an
  idiom on which designs can be based.</p>

  <p>The issue us that the connection does not close properly and is stuck in the 'sleep' mode</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was actually only half right.</p>

<p>The problem I ran into was actually that each app was defining a new connection to the database sever. So each time I closed all the connections App A would make a bunch of new connections as per it's WEB.xml config file and run happily. App B would do the same. The problem is that they are <em>independent pools</em> which try to grab up to the server defined limit. It is a kind of race condition I guess. So when App A has finished with the connections it sits waiting to to use them again until the timeout has passed while App B who needs the connection now is denied the resources even though App A has finished with the and should be back in the pool. Once the timeout has passed, the connection is freed up and B (or C etc) can get at it again.</p>

<p>e.g. if the limit is 10 (mySQL profile limit) and each app has been configured to use a max of 10 the there will be 20 attempts at connections. Obviously this is a bad situation.</p>

<p>The solution is to RTFM and put the <a href=""http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/config/context.html"" rel=""nofollow"">connection details in the right place</a>. This does make shared posting a pain but there are ways around it (such as linking to other xml files from the context).</p>

<p>Just to be explicit: I put the connection details in the WEB.xml for each app and the had a fight about it.</p>

<p>For JOGL 2 with SWT specifically, I've got a series of tutorials starting at <a href=""http://wadeawalker.wordpress.com/2010/10/09/tutorial-a-cross-platform-workbench-program-using-java-opengl-and-eclipse/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wadeawalker.wordpress.com/2010/10/09/tutorial-a-cross-platform-workbench-program-using-java-opengl-and-eclipse/</a> that demonstrates exactly how to make cross-platform JOGL SWT applications, complete with installable native binaries.</p>

<p>Or if you don't want to use Eclipse RCP, here's an even simpler example that just draws one triangle with JOGL 2 and SWT. To build it, put it in a project with swt.jar (from <a href=""http://www.eclipse.org/swt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eclipse.org/swt/</a>) and the latest JOGL autobuild .jar and .dll files (from <a href=""http://jogamp.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jogamp.org/</a>). The only problem with this simple example is that it won't be cross-platform without some extra help -- you need the ability that Eclipse RCP gives you to bundle multiple sets of platform libraries together into one project.</p>

<p>I've struggled with this for a few months myself. The best solution is to make your application portable so you have the same JNDI name in both Tomcat and Weblogic.</p>

<p>In order to do that, you change your <code>web.xml</code> and <code>spring-beans.xml</code> to point to a single jndi name, and provide a mapping to each vendor specific jndi name.</p>

<p>I've placed each file below.</p>

<p>You need:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <code>&lt;resource-ref /&gt;</code> entry in web.xml for your app to use a single name</li>
<li>A file <code>WEB-INF/weblogic.xml</code> to map your jndi name to the resource managed by WebLogic</li>
<li>A file <code>META-INF/context.xml</code> to map your jndi name to the resource managed by Tomcat
<ul>
<li>This can be either in the Tomcat installation or in your app.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>As a general rule, prefer to have your jndi names in your app like <code>jdbc/MyDataSource</code> and <code>jms/ConnFactory</code> and avoid prefixing them with <code>java:comp/env/</code>.</p>

<p>Also, data sources and connection factories are best managed by the container and used with JNDI. It's a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3111992/difference-between-configuring-data-source-in-persistence-xml-and-in-spring-confi/4138327#4138327"">common mistake to instantiate database connection pools in your application</a>.</p>

</ul>

<p>If you spend any time with one of the open source tools, you'll notice that even though they include source-to-source migration as a feature, it's hard to find working examples. I imagine this is because there's no such thing as a one-size-fits-all migration. Each project/team makes unique use of a language and can vary by libraries used, type complexity, idioms, style, etc. It makes sense to define some transformations per migration. This means a project must reach some critical mass before automatic migration is worth the effort.</p>

<h2>Question:</h2>

<p>One interesting point for me was to see how Groovy deals with implicit returns. In Groovy it is possible to ""return"" from a method simply leaving a value at the end (without return). What do you think happens, if you uncomment the <em>runningThreads.remove(..)</em> line in the finally statement - will this overwrite the regular return value (""OK"") and cover the exception?!</p>

5212707,2,,47555,3/6/2011 19:03,8,,"<p>We've been using Stripes for about 4 years now. Our stack is Stripes/EJB3/JPA.</p>

<p>Many use Stripes plus Stripernate as a single, full stack solution. We don't because we want our business logic within the EJB tier, so we simply rely on JPA Entities as combined Model and DTO.</p>

<p>Stripes does the binding to our Entities/DTO and we shove them back in to the EJB tier for work. For most of our CRUD stuff this is very thing and straightforward, making our 80% use case trivial to work with. Yet we have the flexibility to do whatever we want for the edge cases that always come up with complicate applications.</p>

<p>We have a very large base Action Bean which encapsulates the bulk of our CRUD operations that makes call backs in to the individual subclasses specific to the entities and forms.</p>

<p>We also have a large internal tag file library to manage our pages, security, navigation, tasks, etc. A simple CRUD edit form is little more than a list of field names, and we get all of the chrome and menus and access controls ""for free"".</p>

<p>The beauty of this is that we get to keep the HTTP request based metaphor that we like and we get to choose the individual parts of the system rather than use one fat stack. The Stripes layer is lean and mean, and never gets in our way.</p>

<p>We have a bunch of Ajax integrating YUI and JQuery, all working against our Stripes and EJB stack painlessly.</p>

<p>I also ported a lighter version of the stack to GAE for a sample project, basically having to do minor work to our EJB tier. So, the entire stack is very nimble and amicable to change. Stripes is a big factor of that since we let it do the few things that it does, and does very well. Then delegate the rest to other parts of the stack.</p>

<p>As always there are parts folks would rather have different at times, but Stripes would be the last part to go in our stack, frankly. It could be better at supporting the full HTTP verb set, but I'd rather fix Stripes to do that better than switch over to something else.</p>

<p>The entire core system was initially written by one person in Java (Using a higher level language allows you to be more productive, Java is a good choice because it doesn't sacrifice speed to do so).  It has amazingly fast/smooth graphics and everything you'd expect in a modern independent game.</p>

<p>I also run a Minecraft server on a tiny/old laptop in a 300mb VM.  It manages up to 10 players each in different areas of the map at the same time without significantly changing the server load.</p>

<p>The best part?  The same jar file runs on Mac, PC and Linux.  I run my server on linux and sometimes run a second server on my Mac.  People I personally know are split pretty evenly between PC and non-PC (Mac+Linux) clients.</p>

<p>Perhaps Java isn't currently known terribly well for game development, but I think as developers learn to build better Java code it will become a more well-known alternative.</p>

<li>DOES NOT USE ANY 3rd PARTY/EXTERNAL APPLICATIONS TO WORK.</li>
<li>DOES NOT USE THE WINDOWS API (directly)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is pure, Java code.</p>

<p>It uses reflection to work, by actually accessing the private methods in the java.util.prefs.Preferences class. The internals of this class are complicated, but the class itself is very easy to use.</p>

<p>For example, the following code obtains the exact windows distribution <strong>from the registry</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>String value = WinRegistry.readString (
    WinRegistry.HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE,                             //HKEY
   ""SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion"",           //Key
   ""ProductName"");                                              //ValueName
    System.out.println(""Windows Distribution = "" + value);

6455738,2,,50255,6/23/2011 14:29,3,,"<p>I have been thinking a lot about the topic of this <strong>very interesting question</strong> in
the last few days. First of all, if I have understood correctly, Java already has
some basic notion of closures (defined through anonymous classes) but the new feature
that is going to be introduced is the support for closures based on anonymous functions.</p>

<p>This extension will definitely make the language more expressive but I am not sure
if it really fits with the rest of the language.
Java has been designed as an object-oriented language with no support for functional programming: Will the new semantics be easy to understand? Java 6 does not even have functions, will Java 7 have anonymous functions but no ""normal"" functions?</p>

<p>My impression is that as new programming styles or paradigms like functional
programming become more popular, everyone wants to use them in their
favourite OOP language. This is understandable: one wants to continue to use
a language they're familiar with while adopting new features. But in this way
a language can become really complex and lose coherence.</p>

<p>So my attitude at the moment is to stick to Java 6 for OOP (I hope Java 6 will still
be supported for a while) and, in case I really get interested in doing OOP + FP,
to take a look at some other language like Scala (Scala was defined to be multi-
paradigm from the beginning and can be well integrated with Java) rather than switching
to Java 7.</p>

<p>I think Java owes its success to the fact that it combines a simple language with very
powerful libraries and tools, and I do not think that new features like closures will
make it a better programming language.</p>

6486803,2,,66066,6/26/2011 21:16,3,,"<p>Based on the comments above I think this is a good approach to change the old-fashioned global constant class (having public static final variables) to its enum-like equivalent in a way like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Constants {

    private Constants() {
        throw new AssertionError();
    }

    public interface ConstantType {}

    public enum StringConstant implements ConstantType {
        DB_HOST(""localhost"");
        // other String constants come here

        private String value;
        private StringConstant(String value) {
            this.value = value;
        }
        public String value() {
            return value;
        }
    }

    public enum IntConstant implements ConstantType {
        DB_PORT(3128), 
        MAX_PAGE_SIZE(100);
        // other int constants come here

        private int value;
        private IntConstant(int value) {
            this.value = value;
        }
        public int value() {
            return value;
        }
    }

    public enum SimpleConstant implements ConstantType {
        STATE_INIT,
        STATE_START,

7596965,2,,64036,9/29/2011 11:57,12,,"<p>One way to implement deep copy is to add copy constructors to each associated class. A copy constructor takes an instance of 'this' as its single argument and copies all the values from it. Quite some work, but pretty straightforward and safe.</p>

<p>EDIT: note that you don't need to use accessor methods to read fields. You can access all fields directly because the source instance is always of the same type as the instance with the copy constructor. Obvious but might be overlooked.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>public class Order {

    private long number;

    public Order() {
    }

    /**
     * Copy constructor
     */
    public Order(Order source) {

    }

    /**
     * Copy constructor
     */
    public Customer(Customer source) {
        name = source.name;
        for (Order sourceOrder : source.orders) {
            orders.add(new Order(sourceOrder));

    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;

<p>Edit: Note that when using copy constructors you need to know the runtime type of the object you are copying. With the above approach you cannot easily copy a mixed list (you might be able to do it with some reflection code). </p>

9049008,2,,61559,1/28/2012 22:01,72,,"<p>Mono does a better job at targeting the platforms I want to support. Other than that, it is all subjective.</p>

<p>I share C# code across the following platforms:
- iOS (iPhone/iPad)
- Android
- The Web (HTML5)
- Mac (OS X)
- Linux
- Windows</p>

<p>I could share it even more places:
- Windows Phone 7
- Wii
- XBox
- PS3
- etc.</p>

<p>The biggie is iOS since <a href=""http://xamarin.com/monotouch"">MonoTouch</a> works fantastically. I do not know of any good way to target iOS with Java. You cannot target Windows Phone 7 with Java, so I would say that the days of Java being better for mobile are behind us.</p>

<p>The biggest factor for me though is personal productivity (and happiness). C# as a language is years ahead of Java IMHO and the .NET framework is a joy to use. Most of what is being added in Java 7 and Java 8 has been in C# for years. JVM languages like Scala and Clojure (both available on the CLR) are pretty nice though.</p>

<p>I see Mono as a platform in it's own right (a great one) and treat .NET as the Microsoft implementation of Mono on Windows. This means that I develop and test on Mono first. This works wonderfully.</p>

<p>If both Java and .NET (Mono let's say) were Open Source projects without any corporate backing, I would choose Mono over Java every time. I believe it is just a better platform.</p>

<p>Both .NET/Mono and the JVM are great choices, although I would personally use some other language than Java on the JVM.</p>

<h1>My take on some of the other comments:</h1>

<p><strong>Issue: Performance.</strong></p>

<p>**Answer: Both the JVM and the CLR perform better than detractors say they do. I would say that the JVM performs better. Mono is generally slower than .NET (though not always).</p>

<p>I personally would take ASP.NET MVC over J2EE any day both as a developer and an end-user. Support for <a href=""http://www.mono-project.com/Release_Notes_Mono_2.10#Google_Native_Client_Support"">Google Native Client</a> is pretty cool too. Also, I know that poor GUI performance for desktop Java apps is supposed to be a thing of the past but I keep finding slow ones. Then again, I could say the same for WPF. GTK# is plenty fast though so there is no reason they have to be slow.</p>

<p><strong>Issue: Java has a larger ecosystem of libraries available.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer: Probably true, but it is a non-issue in practice.</strong></p>

<p>Practically every Java library (including the JDK) runs just dandy on .NET/Mono thanks to <a href=""http://www.ikvm.net/"">IKVM.NET</a>. This piece of technology is a true marvel. The integration is amazing; you can use a Java library just like it was native. I have only had to use Java libraries in one .NET app though. The .NET/Mono ecosystem generally offers more than I need.</p>

<p><strong>Issue: Java has better (broader) tools support</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer: Not on Windows. Otherwise I agree. MonoDevelop is nice though.</strong></p>

<p>I want to give a shout-out to <a href=""http://monodevelop.com/"">MonoDevelop</a>; it is a jewel. MonoDevelop integrates most of the tools I want use including code completion (intellisense), Git/Subversion integration, support for unit tests, SQL integration, debugging, easy refactoring, and assembly browsing with on-the-fly decompilation. It is wonderful to use the same environment for everything from server-side web to mobile apps.</p>

<p><strong>Issue: Compatibility across platforms.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer: Mono is a single code-base across all platforms, including Windows.</strong></p>

<p>Develop for Mono first and deploy to .NET on Windows if you like. If you compare .NET from MS to Java though then Java has the edge in terms of consistency across platforms. See next answer...</p>

<p><strong>Issue: Mono lags .NET.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer: No it does not.</strong> IMHO, this is an often stated but incorrect statement.</p>

<p>The Mono distribution from Xamarin ships with C#, VB.NET, F#, IronPython, IronRuby, and I think maybe Boo out of the box. The Mono C# compiler is completely up to date with MS. The Mono VB.NET compiler does lag the MS version. The other compilers are the same on both platforms (as are other .NET languages like Nemerle, Boo, and Phalanger (PHP) ).</p>

<p>Mono ships with a lot of the actual Microsoft written code including the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR), Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF), F#, and ASP.NET MVC. Because Razor is not Open Source, Mono currently ships with MVC2 but MVC3 works on Mono just fine.</p>

<p>The core Mono platform has kept pace with .NET or many years and the compatibility is impressive. You can use the full C# 4.0 language and even some C# 5.0 features today. In fact, Mono often leads .NET in many ways.</p>

<p>Mono implements parts of the CLR spec that even Microsoft does not support (like 64 bit arrays). One of the most exciting new pieces of technology in the .NET world is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Roslyn"">Rosylyn</a>. Mono has offered the C# compiler as a service for many years. Some of what Rosylyn offers is available via <a href=""http://wiki.sharpdevelop.net/NRefactory.ashx"">NRefractory</a> as well. An example of were Mono is still ahead would be the SIMD instructions to accelerate gaming performance.</p>

<p>Microsoft does offer a number of products on top of .NET that are not available in Mono which is were the misconception about Mono lagging comes from. Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Entity Framework (EF), WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) are examples of products which do not work, or are poorly supported, on Mono. The obvious solution is to use cross-platform alternatives like GTK#, NHibernate, and ServiceStack instead.</p>

<p><strong>Issue: Microsoft is evil.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer: True. So what.</strong></p>

<p>Many people offer the following reasons to avoid using Mono:</p>

<p>1) You should not use Mono because Microsoft tech should be avoided</p>

<p>2) Mono sucks because it does not let you use every technology that Microsoft offers</p>

<p>To me, it is clear that these statements are incompatible. I reject the first statement but will skip that argument here. The second statement is true of all .NET alternatives.</p>

<p>The JVM is a great platform and the explosion of JVM languages is awesome. Use what makes you happy. For now, that is often .NET/Mono for me.</p>

<p>Using Junit4</p>

<p>Split your tests up so that there is one test method per class (this solution only changes classloaders between classes, not between methods as the parent runner gathers all the methods once per class)</p>

<p>Add the @RunWith(SeparateClassloaderTestRunner.class) annotation to your test classes.</p>

<p>Create the SeparateClassloaderTestRunner to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class SeparateClassloaderTestRunner extends BlockJUnit4ClassRunner {

    public SeparateClassloaderTestRunner(Class&lt;?&gt; clazz) throws InitializationError {
        super(getFromTestClassloader(clazz));
    }

    private static Class&lt;?&gt; getFromTestClassloader(Class&lt;?&gt; clazz) throws InitializationError {
        try {
            ClassLoader testClassLoader = new TestClassLoader();
            return Class.forName(clazz.getName(), true, testClassLoader);
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
            throw new InitializationError(e);
        }
    }

    public static class TestClassLoader extends URLClassLoader {
        public TestClassLoader() {
            super(((URLClassLoader)getSystemClassLoader()).getURLs());
        }

        @Override
        public Class&lt;?&gt; loadClass(String name) throws ClassNotFoundException {
            if (name.startsWith(""org.mypackages."")) {
                return super.findClass(name);
            }
            return super.loadClass(name);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note I had to do this to test code running in a legacy framework which I couldn't change. Given the choice I'd reduce the use of statics and/or put test hooks in to allow the system to be reset.  It may not be pretty but it allows me to test an awful lot of code that would be difficult otherwise.</p>

<p>Also this solution breaks anything else that relies on classloading tricks such as mokito.</p>

<p>The nice thing about this idiom is that you can verify that the delegated-to method exists, and has the required signature, at the point where you create the delegator (although not at compile-time, unfortunately, although a FindBugs plug-in might help here), then use it safely to delegate to various instances.</p>

<p>The assumption missed here is <em>provided that they are running in authentic, or standard, java run-time environment</em>. Nothing can oblige the protected java app not only to launch these classes but even decrypt and pass them to <code>ClassLoader</code>.

And absolutely doesn't matter which “patch finder” is used or which trick is used by hackers. These technical details are a quite different story. </p>

11209443,2,,65475,6/26/2012 14:20,1,,"<p>As already stated by Jason Cohen, the Java Language Specification defines what a legal identifier is in section 3.8:</p>

<p>""An identifier is an unlimited-length sequence of Java letters and Java digits, the
first of which must be a Java letter. [...] A 'Java letter' is a character for which the method Character.isJavaIdentifierStart(int) returns true. A 'Java letter-or-digit' is a character for which the method Character.isJavaIdentifierPart(int) returns true.""</p>

<p>This hopefully answers your second question. Regarding your first question; I've been taught both by teachers and (as far as I can remember) Java compilers that a Java class name should be an identifier that begins with a capital letter A-Z, but I can't find any reliable source on this. When trying it out with OpenJDK there are no warnings when beginning class names with lower-case letters or even a $-sign. When using a $-sign, you do have to escape it if you compile from a bash shell, however.</p>

For those who don't have access to a copy, the question is framed as a kind of filter/test for candidates interviewing for a position requiring ""really good Java programmers.""</p>

<p>Specifically, he asks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would you write a program, in pure Java, that would cause the Java Virtual Machine to crash?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've programmed in Java for over 15 years, and I found this question to be both puzzling and unfair. As others have pointed out, Java, as a managed language, is specifically designed <em>not to crash</em>. Of course there are always JVM bugs, but:</p>

<ol>
<li>After 15+ years of production-level JREs, it's rare.</li>
<li>Any such bugs are likely to be patched in the next release, so how likely are you as a programmer to run into and recall the details of the current set of JRE show-stoppers?</li>
</ol>

<p>As others have mentioned, some native code via JNI is a sure way to crash a JRE. But the author specifically mentioned <em>in pure Java</em>, so that's out.</p>

<p>Another option would be to feed the JRE bogus byte codes; it's easy enough to dump some garbage binary data to a .class file, and ask the JRE to run it:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo 'crap crap crap' &gt; crap.class
$ java crap
Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.ClassFormatError: Incompatible magic value 1668440432 in class file crap
</code></pre>

<p>Does that count? I mean the JRE itself hasn't crashed; it properly detected the bogus code, reported it, and exited. </p>

<p>This leaves us with the most obvious kinds of solutions such as blowing the stack via recursion, running out of heap memory via object allocations, or simply throwing <code>RuntimeException</code>. But this just causes the JRE to exit with a <code>StackOverflowError</code> or similar exception, which, again <em>is not really a crash</em>.</p>

<p>So what's left? I'd really love to hear what the author really had in mind as a proper solution.</p>

11788474,2,,63042,8/3/2012 2:33,1,,"<p>Java 5 introduced several major updates, such as language improvements (i.e. Annotations, Generics, Autoboxing, and improved syntax for looping) among many others. Annotation is a mechanism for tagging classes with metadata so that, they can be used by metadata-aware programs. Generics is a mechanism of specifying types for objects belonging to collections, such as Arraylists, so that type safety is guaranteed at compile time. Autoboxing allows the automatic conversions between primitive types (e.g. int) and wrapper types (e.g. Integer). Improved syntax for looping includes the enhancements for each loop for going through the items of array or collections comparatively easily.</p>

<p>Java 6 focuses on new specifications and APIs including XML, Web Services, JDBC version 4.0, programming based on Annotations, API’s for Java compiler and Application client GUI.With new compiler API added with Java 6, the java compiler can now receive and/or send output to an abstraction of the file system (programs can specify/process compiler output). Furthermore, Java 6 added enhancements to the applications GUI capabilities in AWT (faster splash screens and support for system tray) and SWING (better drag-and-drop, support for customizing layouts, multithreading enhancements and ability to write GIF images).</p>

<p>I frequently plug long strings of text into .properties files, then generate email subjects and bodies from those.  Indeed, this appears to be the default way to do i18n in Spring Framework.  I put XML tags, as placeholders, into the strings and I use replaceAll() to replace the XML tags with the values at runtime.</p>

<p>In this case, the user had entered ""$3"" somewhere in their input and replaceAll() went looking in the search regex for the third matching group, didn't find one, and puked.</p>

<p>I would recomend <a href=""http://www.xerial.org/trac/Xerial/wiki/SQLiteJDBC"">Xerials fork</a> of Crawshaw sqlite wrapper.  I replaced sqlitejdbc-v056.jar  with Xerials sqlite-jdbc-3.7.2.jar file without any problem. </p>

<p><strong>What is different from Zentus's SQLite JDBC?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The original Zentus's SQLite JDBC driver
  <a href=""http://www.zentus.com/sqlitejdbc/"">http://www.zentus.com/sqlitejdbc/</a> itself is an excellent utility for
  using SQLite databases from Java language, and our SQLiteJDBC library
  also relies on its implementation. However, its pure-java version,
  which totally translates c/c++ codes of SQLite into Java, is
  significantly slower compared to its native version, which uses SQLite
  binaries compiled for each OS (win, mac, linux).</p>
  
  <p>To use the native version of sqlite-jdbc, user had to set a path to
  the native codes (dll, jnilib, so files, which are JNDI C programs) by
  using command-line arguments, e.g., -Djava.library.path=(path to the
  dll, jnilib, etc.), or -Dorg.sqlite.lib.path, etc. This process was
  error-prone and bothersome to tell every user to set these variables.
  Our SQLiteJDBC library completely does away these inconveniences.</p>
  
  <p>Another difference is that we are keeping this SQLiteJDBC libray
  up-to-date to the newest version of SQLite engine, because we are one
  of the hottest users of this library. For example, SQLite JDBC is a
  core component of UTGB (University of Tokyo Genome Browser) Toolkit,
  which is our utility to create personalized genome browsers.</p>

The encoding specifies how you wish to represent your characters as bytes, so you can't really ignore the issue.  As for avoiding problems, my opinion is: pick one charset (e.g. ""UTF-8"") and stick with it.  </p>

<p>Regarding how to actually do it, as has been pointed out, ""<em>the obvious names for these classes are <strong>ReaderInputStream</strong> and <strong>WriterOutputStream</strong>.</em>""  Surprisngly, ""<em>these are not included in the Java library</em>"" even though the 'opposite' classes, <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/InputStreamReader.html"">InputStreamReader</a> and <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/OutputStreamWriter.html"">OutputStreamWriter</a> <strong>are</strong> included.</p>

<p>So, lots of people have come up with their own implementations, including <strong>Apache</strong> <a href=""http://commons.apache.org/io/"">Commons IO</a>.  Depending on licensing issues, you will probably be able to include the commons-io library in your project, or even copy a portion of the source code (which is downloadable <a href=""http://commons.apache.org/io/download_io.cgi"">here</a>).</p>

15861994,2,,59175,4/7/2013 11:47,0,,"<p>The CLR and JVM have goals and philosophies that differ more than you might think. In general, the JVM aims to optimize more dynamic, higher-level code while the CLR gives you more low-level tools to do these kinds of optimizations yourself. </p>

<p>A good example is stack allocation. On the CLR you have explicit stack allocation of custom value types. On the JVM the only custom types are reference types but the JVM can convert heap allocations to stack allocations in certain circumstances through Escape Analysis.</p>

<p>Another example. In Java, methods are virtual by default. On C# at least, they are not. It is much more difficult to optimize virtual method calls because the code that gets executed at a given call site cannot be determined statically.</p>

<p>Under the hood, their execution systems are quite different. Most JVMs (in particular, Hotspot) start out with a bytecode interpreter and only JIT-compile parts of the code that are executed heavily e.g. tight loops. They can also re-compile these over and over each time using execution statistics collected from previous runs to drive optimizations. This allows more optimization effort to be applied to the parts of the program that need it most. This is called adaptive optimization.</p>

<p>The CLR compiles everything up-front only once. It does fewer optimization both because it has more code to compile and so has to be fast and because it doesn't have any statistics of the actual execution paths taken to feed into its optimizations. This approach does have the very significant advantage of allowing you to cache compilation results across processes, which CLR does but JVM does not.</p>

<p>A large percentage of the Hotspot JVM code is dedicated to these adaptive optimizations and they are what put Java in the same performance ballpark as native code for most general purpose computation in the early 2000s. They are also what makes the JVM a decent target for dynamic languages. I'm excluding here the more recent developments of the Dynamic Languages Runtime and invokedynamic as I don't know enough about the DLR.</p>

I have seen quite a few real life instances where all constants are bunched together into an interface. A few posts have rightly called that a bad practice, primarily because that's not what an interface is for. An interface should enforce a contract and should not be a place to put unrelated constants in. Putting it together into a class that cannot be instantiated (through a private constructor) too is fine if the constant semantics don't belong to a specific class(es). I always put a constant in the class that it's most related to, because that makes sense and is also easily maintainable.</p>

<p>Enums are a good choice to represent a range of values, but if you are storing standalone constants with an emphasis on the absolute value (eg. TIMEOUT = 100 ms) you can just go for the <code>static final</code> approach.</p>

<p>I tried Apache Tika but it is <em>huge</em> with tons of dependencies, <code>URLConnection</code> doesn't use the bytes of the files, <code>MimetypesFileTypeMap</code> also just looks at files names, and I couldn't move to Java 7.</p>

<p>With SimpleMagic you can do something like:</p>

<pre><code>// create a magic utility using the internal magic file
ContentInfoUtil util = new ContentInfoUtil();
// if you want to use a different config file(s), you can load them by hand:
// ContentInfoUtil util = new ContentInfoUtil(""/etc/magic"");
...
ContentInfo info = util.findMatch(""/tmp/upload.tmp"");
// or
ContentInfo info = util.findMatch(inputStream);

17999321,2,,58988,8/1/2013 16:15,2,,"<p>The interface segregation is the “I” on the SOLID principle, before digging too deep with the first, let’s explain what’s does the latter mean. </p>

<p>SOLID can be considered a set of best practices and recommendations made by experts (meaning they have  been proved before) in order to provide a reliable foundation in how we design applications. These practices strive to  make easier to maintain, extend, adapt and scale our applications.</p>

<p><strong>Why should I care about SOLID programming?</strong></p>

<p>First of all, you have to realize you are not going to be forever where you are. If we use standards and well known architectures, we can be sure that our code will be easy to maintain by other developers that come after us, and I’m sure you wouldn’t want to deal with the task of fixing a code that didn’t applied any known methodology as it would be very hard to understand it.</p>

<p><strong>The interface segregation principle.</strong></p>

<p>Know that we know what the SOLID principles are we can get into more detail about the Interface Segregation principle, but what exactly does the interface segregation says?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Clients should not be forced to implement unnecessary methods which
  they will not use”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that sometimes we tend to make interfaces with a lot of methods, which can be good to an extent, however this can easily abused, and we can end up with classes that implement empty or useless methods which of course adds extra code and burden to our apps.
Imagine you are declaring a lot of methods in single interface, if you like visual aids a class that is implementing an interface but that is really needing a couple of methods of it would look like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/V6p8i.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In the other hand, if you properly apply the interface segregation and split your interface in smaller subsets you can me sure to implement those that are only needed:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/M0eWu.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>See! Is way better!  Enforcing this principle will allow you to have low coupling which aids to  a better maintainability and high  resistance to changes. So you can really leverage the usage of interfaces and implementing the methods when you really should.
Now let’s review a less abstract example, say you declared an interface called Reportable</p>

<pre><code>public interface Reportable {

        void printPDF();
        void printWord();
        void printExcel();
        void printPPT();
        void printHTML();


}
</code></pre>

<p>And you have a client that will only to export some data in Excel format, you can implement the interface, but would you only have to implement the excel method? The answer is no, you will have to code the implementation for all the methods even if you are not going to use them, this can cause a lot of junk code hence making the code hard to maintain..</p>

<p><strong>Remember keep it simple and don’t repeat yourself and you will find that you are already using this principle without knowing.</strong></p>

<p>References <code>pnt1</code> and <code>pnt2</code> are <strong>passed by value</strong> to the tricky method, which means that now yours references <code>pnt1</code> and <code>pnt2</code> have their <code>copies</code> named <code>arg1</code> and <code>arg2</code>.So <code>pnt1</code> and <code>arg1</code> <em>points</em> to the same object. (Same for the <code>pnt2</code> and <code>arg2</code>)
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/qd1GH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In the <code>tricky</code> method:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/o4WT0.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Next in the <code>tricky</code> method</p>

<pre><code>Point temp = arg1;
arg1 = arg2;
arg2 = temp;
</code></pre>

<p>Here, you first create new <code>temp</code> Point reference which will <em>point</em> on same place like <code>arg1</code> reference. Then you move reference <code>arg1</code> to <em>point</em> to the same place like <code>arg2</code> reference.
Finally <code>arg2</code> will <em>point</em> to the same place like <code>temp</code>.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/fX5Q3.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>From here scope of <code>tricky</code> method is gone and you don't have access any more to the references: <code>arg1</code>, <code>arg2</code>, <code>temp</code>. <strong>But important note is that everything you do with these references when they are 'in life' will permanently affect object on which they are <em>point</em> to.</strong> </p>

<p>So after executing method <code>tricky</code>, when you return to <code>main</code>, you have this situation:

20566453,2,,40480,12/13/2013 12:23,1,,"<h2>A reference is always a value when represented, no matter what language you use.</h2>

<p>Getting an outside of the box view, let's look at Assembly or some low level memory management. At the CPU level a <em>reference</em> to anything immediately becomes a <em>value</em> if it gets written to memory or to one of the CPU registers. (That is why <em>pointer</em> is a good definition. It is a value, which has a purpose at the same time).</p>

<p>Data in memory has a <strong>Location</strong> and at that location there is a value (byte,word, whatever). In Assembly we have a convenient solution to give a <strong>Name</strong> to certain <strong>Location</strong> (aka variable), but when compiling the code, the assembler simply replaces <strong>Name</strong> with the designated location just like your browser replaces domain names with IP addresses.</p>

<p>Down to the core it is technically impossible to pass a reference to anything in any language without representing it (when it immediately becomes a value).</p>

<p>Lets say we have a variable Foo, its <strong>Location</strong> is at the 47th byte in memory and its <strong>Value</strong> is 5. We create another variable <strong>Ref</strong> which is at 223rd byte in memory, and its value will be 47. If you just look at 5 and 47 without any other information, you will see two <strong>Values</strong>.
To reach to <code>5</code> we have to travel:</p>

<pre><code>[223] -&gt; 47
[47] -&gt; 5
</code></pre>

<p>If we want to call a method/function/procedure with Foo's value, there are a few possible way to pass the variable to the method:</p>

<ol>
<li>5 gets copied to one of the CPU registers (ie. EAX).</li>
<li>5 gets PUSHd to the stack.</li>
<li>47 gets copied to one of the CPU registers</li>
<li>47 PUSHd to the stack.</li>
<li>223 gets copied to one of the CPU registers.</li>
<li>223 gets PUSHd to the stack.</li>
</ol>

<p>In every cases above a value - a <strong>copy</strong> of a value - has been created, it is now upto the method to handle it. When you write ""Foo"" inside the method, it is either read out from EAX, or automatically  <strong>dereferenced</strong>, or double dereferenced. This is hidden from the developer until she circumvents the dereferencing process. So a <em>reference</em> is a <em>value</em> when represented, because a reference is a value that has to be processed (even though at CPU level).</p>

<p>We have Foo inside the method:</p>

<ul>
<li>in case 1. and 2. if you change Foo (<code>Foo = 9</code>) it only affects local scope. (you have a copy of the Value), from inside the method we cannot even determine where in memory Foo is located.</li>
<li>in case 3. and 4. if you use default language constructs and change Foo (<code>Foo = 11</code>), it could change Foo globally (depends on the language, ie. Java or like Pascal's <code>procedure findMin(x, y, z: integer;</code><strong>var m</strong><code>: integer);</code>). However if the language allows you to circumvent the dereference process, you can change <code>47</code>, say to <code>49</code>. At that point if you modify Foo inside the method (<code>Foo = 12</code>) you will probably FUBAR the program because you will write to a different memory area (and not at <code>47</code>). BUT Foo's <code>47</code> did not change globally, only the Foo's inside the method, because <code>47</code> was also a copy to the method.</li>
<li>in case 4. and 5. if you modify <code>223</code> it will only create local mayhem, however if you are able to dereference <code>223</code> and modify <code>47</code>, it will affect Foo <strong>globally</strong>, because you have only a copy of <code>223</code>, but <code>47</code> was never copied/saved.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nitpicking on insignificant details, even languages that do pass-by-reference will pass values to functions, but those functions know that they have to use it for dereferencing purposes. This pass-the-reference-as-value is just hidden from the programmer because it is practically useless and the terminology is only <em>pass-by-reference</em>.</p>

<p>Strict <em>pass-by-value</em> is also useless, it would mean that a 100 Mbyte array should have to copied every time we call a method with the array as argument, therefore Java cannot be stricly pass-by-value. Every language would pass a reference to this huge array (as a value) and either employs copy-on-write mechanism if that array can be changed locally inside the method or allows the method (as Java does) to modify the array globally (from the caller's view) and a few languages allows to modify the Value of the reference itself.</p>

<p>So in short and in Java's own terminology, Java is <em>pass-by-value</em> where <em>value</em> can be: either a <strong>real value</strong> or a <strong>value</strong> that is a representation of a <strong>reference</strong>. </p>

<pre><code>A a = new A();

You can imagine like this: a and b are both names, and they are refer to your dog, when c=b is compiled, your dog got another name called c. If the dog is passed to a method, whatever its name is when it was passing, the method got the dog, not the name.</p>

<p>In the following code, I'm streaming an object from Amazon S3 to the client in a servlet.</p>

import java.io.OutputStream;
import org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils;

InputStream in = object.getObjectContent();
OutputStream out = response.getOutputStream();
