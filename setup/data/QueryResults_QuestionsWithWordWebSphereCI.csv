<p>I would prefer if the extra space was used in a more effective manner, possibilities include:</p>

<p>In theory, I could achieve (1) by setting the width of the column (and header) to 0, but also indicate that the column should resize to fit it's contents. But AFAIK Jasper does not actually provide a ""resize width to fit contents"" option.</p>

One of our frustrations is that the URLs often end with punctuation.

<p>I think this is because Eclipse sends the equivalent of a force-kill signal to the process, which doesn't cause the shut-down hook to execute (equivalent of taskkill /F on Windows or kill -p on linux), though I'm not absolutely sure.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to get around this? I'm running Windows (Vista), and I've a feeling it may be a Windows-specific issue, but I'm not sure (I read something about it a while back, but can't remember anything, only that nobody suggested a solution).</p>

<p>Does anyone who has any experience with this sort of stuff have any recommendations for reading / source code to examine? Or just general advice on what I should be trying to learn about if I want to get into the world of writing speech recognition programs (sometimes it's hard to know what to search for if you don't have much knowledge about the domain).</p>

<p>Edit: I'd like to do something cross-platform, but for the moment I'd be targeting linux. </p>

<p>Edit 2: Thanks csmba for the well-thought out reply. At this point in time, I'm mainly interested in being able to create applications that allow automation, or execution of different commands through voice. So, a limited amount of recognizable commands being able to be strung together. An example would be a music player that took commands like ""Play the album Hello Everything by Squarepusher"", or an application launcher that allowed the user to create voice-shortcuts to launch specific apps.</p>

<p>I realize that it's a pretty giant problem, and that I have nowhere near the level of knowledge required right now to tackle implementing an entire recognition engine, although the techniques involved with doing so fascinate me, and it is something I'd like to work myself up to doing. In all likelihood, I'll probably end up picking up a book or two on the subject and studying up / playing with ""simple"" implementations in my free time.</p>

Under these conditions the server socket on the JEE server is still accepting and queueing requests from client applications. This causes the client application to use up all its threads waiting for responses from properly established socket connections. Then all users are locked out of the system as their requests are also being queued.</p>

<p>I've thought of a few solutions but I was wondering if the community has some better ones.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Isolated thread pools for downstream requests. This becomes a problem because you compound the number of idle threads in you system creating many small pools that need to have enough threads to ensure full throughput. Spawning threads means you need to deal with Transaction and Security contexts yourself. Not really a supported JEE solution.</p></li>
<li><p>MDB solution, the preferred asynchronous solution for JEE, this however seems rather heavy-weight but has the added benefit of letting the app server deal with management the MDB thread pools. (Currently number one on my list)</p></li>
<li><p>ESB. This is even more heavy-weight and adds more network and processing time. But it allows you to set individual service timeouts. Also has the problem of it will take forever to get implemented in a big corporation so probably not practical for my time-frame.</p></li>

</code></pre>

<p>We are wiring the connection in Spring's applicationContext.xml.  We are aware that the connection on the AS400 drops at times (they may restart the system overnight--I'm not sure).  However, we would preferably not want to open a new connection when we are wiring everything in the applicationContext.  </p>

<p>This problem occurs irregardless of using a DataSource/JNDI or JDBC</p>

<p>Does anybody know of any settings to add to either Spring or Hibernate to check if the connection gets stale, and if so, drop it and create a new one?  Or any other ideas to resolve this issue?  Let me know if you need more information/code.</p>

<p>Much appreciated,</p>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>Checked out some posts on the Spring Community Forums and I've implemented my DataSource with commons-dbcp which has some properties like 'testWhileIdle' and 'validationQuery'.  I'm going to leave the app running and check it again in the AM.  Will post an update on the results.</p>

<h3>Update#2:</h3>  

<p>Using dbcp-commons BasicDataSource seems to correct this issue, which appears to be a network problem.  Websphere has pooled connections, and if there's a network issue on the AS400 side, it will try to use the connection it has, which it doesn't know is 'stale'.  Using a validationQuery with a time interval is a cheap (but efficient) way to solve this problem--but there may be a better way on the Websphere side, under configuration.  But, might as well not change what's not broken, so until this fails, it will probably be our solution going forward.</p>

<p>I tested it in a sample app and it worked. Unfortunately when I moved the same code to a struts application, I get NULL in the above print statement.

<p>I have been thinking about what is different to find the problem. My struts application web.xml is more complicated than simple application's web.xml. It has security-constraint, filters and the Struts Servlet configuration. I position resource-ref just before the servlet definitions. It seems like the resource-ref is being ignored. </p>

<p>I have another issue. If I have the mailapi.jar, needed by the javax.mail.Session, in the myapp/WEB-INF/lib folder I get: </p>

<li>How have you set-up one or more worker scripts for queue-oriented systems?</li>
<li>How do you arrange to startup - and restart if necessary - worker scripts as required? (I'm thinking about such tools as init.d/, Ruby-based 'god', DJB's Daemontools, etc, etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm developing an asynchronous queue/worker system, in this case using PHP &amp; <a href=""http://xph.us/software/beanstalkd/"">BeanstalkdD</a> (though the actual language and daemon isn't important). The tasks themselves are not too hard - encoding an array with the commands and parameters into JSON for transport through the Beanstalkd daemon, picking them up in a worker script to action them as required.</p>

<p>There are a number of other similar queue/worker setups out there, such as <a href=""http://rubyforge.org/projects/starling/"">Starling</a>, <a href=""http://www.danga.com/gearman/"">Gearman</a>, <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/"">Amazon's SQS</a> and other more 'enterprise' oriented systems like IBM's MQ and RabbitMQ. If you run something like Gearman, or SQS - how do <em>you</em> start and control the worker pool?  The questions is on the initial worker startup, and then being able to add additional extra workers, shutting them down at will (though I can send a message through the queue to shut them down - as long as some 'watcher' won't automatically restart them). This is not a PHP problem, it's about straight Unix processes of setting up one or more processes to run on startup, or adding more workers to the pool.</p>

<p>A <a href=""http://pastebin.ca/1331063"">bash script to loop a script </a> is already in place - this calls the PHP script which then collects and runs tasks from the queue, occasionally exiting to be able to clean itself up (it can also pause a few seconds on failure, or via a planned event).  This works fine, and building the worker processes on top of that won't be very hard at all.</p>

<p>Getting a good worker controller system is about flexibility, starting one or two automatically on a machine start, and being able to add a couple more from the command line when the queue is busy, shutting down the extras when no longer required.</p>

<h2>Deploy assembled artifacts to production box</h2>

<p>Here, we create the <code>.war</code> (or whatever) elsewhere, configure it for production (possibly creating numerous artifacts for numerous boxes) and place the resulting artifacts on the production servers.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>: No dev tools on production boxes, can re-use artifacts from testing directly, staff doing deployment doesn't need knowledge of build process</li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>: two processes for creating and deploying artifacts; potentially complex configuration of pre-built artifacts could make process hard to script/automate; have to version binary artifacts </li>
</ul>

<h2>Build the artifacts <strong>on</strong> the production box</h2>

<p>Here, the same process used day-to-day to build and deploy locally on developer boxes is used to deploy to production.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>: One process to maintain; and it's heavily tested/validated by frequent use.  Potentially easier to customize configuration at artifact creation time rather than customize pre-built artifact afterword; no versioning of binary artifacts needed.</li>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>: Potentially complex development tools needed on all production boxes; deployment staff needs to understand build process; you <strong>aren't</strong> deploying what you tested</li>
</ul>

<p>I've mostly used the second process, admittedly out of necessity (no time/priority for another deployment process).  Personally I don't buy arguments like ""the production box has to be clean of all compilers, etc."", but I <strong>can</strong> see the logic in deploying what you've tested (as opposed to building another artifact).  </p>

<p>However, Java Enterprise applications are so sensitive to configuration, it feels like asking for trouble having two processes for configuring artifacts.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Here's a concrete example:</p>

<p>We use OSCache, and enable the disk cache.  The configuration file must be inside the .war file and it references a file path.  This path is different on every environment.  The build process detects the user's configured location and ensures that the properties file placed in the war is correct for his environment.   </p>

<p>If we were to use the build process for deployment, it would be a matter of creating the right configuration for the production environment (e.g. <code>production.build.properties</code>).</p>

<p>If we were to follow the ""deploy assembled artifacts to the production box"", we would need an additional process to extract the (incorrect) OSCache properties and replace it with one appropriate to the production environment.</p>

<p>This creates two processes to accomplish the same thing.</p>

<p>So, the questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this avoidable without ""compiling on production""?</li>
<li>If not, is this worth it?  It the value of ""no compiling on production"" greater than ""Don't Repeat Yourself""?</li>
</ul>

<p>I never really liked Java as a language, or XML for that matter, and have very much been ignoring the whole J2EE (JEE) side of things. For those who have had real and direct experience in both worlds: is there something super cool about J2EE that I'm missing, or is just a bunch of hot air? What justifies the high price of the proprietary app servers?</p>

<p>I'm not trolling here: I'm looking for concrete examples of things that J2EE really nails that are missing from <em>modern</em> LAMP frameworks, if such differences exist. (Modern = Rails, Django, etc). Alternatively pipe in with those things that LAMP really does better (fewer XML sit ups for one).</p>

<p>+++++ Update October 16, 2008</p>

<p>I'm sad to report that most of the replies here are not helpful, and simply fall into one of two categories: ""It scales because here are three examples of large web sites"" and ""It scales because it is really actually much better than the LAMP stack"".</p>

<p>I've done quite a bit of reading, and have concluded that JEE only has one really good trick: transactions (thanks Will) and as for the rest you can succeed or fail on your own merit, there is nothing intrisicly in the environment to cause you to create a scalable and reliable web site, indeed JEE has quite a few traps that make it easy to fail (for instance it is easy to start using session beans without realizing that you are paying now for quite a bit of JMS traffic that perhaps could have been avoided with a different design.)</p>

Looking at the InitialContext object, I know it has the following parameters set in the environments hashtable:</p>

On our production system I can see a strange behaviour in the verbose GC logs. After a period of normal behaviour the system can start rapidly allocating larger and larger blocks. The system starts to spend > 1000 ms to complete each GC, but blocks are being allocated so quickly that there is only a 30 ms gap between allocation failures.</p>

<ul>
<li>Each allocation failure slightly larger than the last by some integer amount x 1024 bytes. E.g. you might have 5 MB, and then a short while later 5 MB + 17 * 1024.</li>
<li>This can go on for up to 10 minutes.</li>
<li>The blocks tend to grow up to 8 to 14 MB in size before it stops.</li>
<li>It's a quad-core system, and I assume that it's now spending >95% of it's time doing GC with three cores waiting for the other core to complete GC. For 10 minutes. Ouch.</li>
<li>Obviously system performance dies at this point.</li>
<li>We have JSF, hibernate &amp; JDBC, web services calls, log4j output and not much else.</li>
</ul>

<p>I interpret this as likely to be something infrastructural rather than our application code. If it was a bad string concatenation inside a loop we would expect more irregular growth than blocks of 1024. If it was StringBuffer or ArrayList growth we would see the block sizes doubling. The growth is making me think of log buffering or something else. I can't think of anything in our app that allocations even 1 MB, let alone 14. Today I looked for logging backing up in memory before being flushed to disk, but the volume of logging statements over this period of GC thrashing was nowhere near the MB range.</p>

<p>Clearly the problem is with the excessive memory allocation rather than with the garbage collection, which is just doing its best to keep up. Something is allocating a large block and trying to grow it inefficiently in increments that are far too small.</p>

<p>Any ideas what might be causing all this when the system is under load? Anybody seen anything similar with Portal Server?</p>

<p>Note: for anybody who's interested it's starting to look like the cause is an occasional but enormous database query. It seems the culprit is either Hibernate or the JDBC driver.</p>

<p>We believe that this change may have affected a number of other applications, particularly in the performance monitoring arena, and we have found a solution that we believe will improve a slew of other potential problems.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, said solution is a kernel change (relatively simple but high-impact if we stuff it up) and we have no experience in submitting kernel patches for review.</p>

<p>Has anyone on SO actually submitted a patch (while I'd appreciate all answers, I suspect the best ones will come from those that have been through the process, even unsuccessfully)? Have you had it accepted (what are the chances that Alan Cox et al hangs about on SO)?</p>

<p>What is the correct process to follow? I have no intention of sending off an email to Linus since I know he has a cadre of protectors that you're supposed to go through before it gets to him. How do I find out who is responsible for a particular section of the kernel.</p>

<p>It may be that I'm being overly optimistic in thinking someone the kernel world's never heard of can contribute, but I'd be interested to find out.</p>

<p>EDIT with more details:</p>

<p>The change is not actually for a performance bug, but an improvement (in my view :-) to the process accounting entries (currently) written when a process terminates.</p>

<p>Websphere App Server (ah, IBM, bless their little hearts) has changed what it does; JVMs used to exit regularly so that their entries were written and we could use that for chargeback.  Now it leaves JVMs lying around for months, meaning the data is not available in a timely fashion unless we force WAS down regularly. Somehow I don't think IBM's Software Group are going to fix their software for us :-). In any case, I believe it may be a useful feature to have for other long-lived processes.</p>

<p>Currently type-3 process accounting records are written when a process exits, what we're looking at is a mechanism to write type-N records periodically while a process is still active giving the figures since last write (or process start if this is the first time).  Chargeback or performance-monitoring applications could choose to use either the type-3 records (totally unchanged) or the interim type-N records. The current workaround we have is to monitor /proc/PID/stat for specific processes but that's a horrible kludge since it doesn't integrate well with the real process accounting.</p>

<p>It needn't be often (we'd be happy with 24 hours) but there may be a performance impact since the work that's currently done only on process exit() will have to be done occasionally on process context switch. Linus et al might not like that idea since it may be a high-impact area of the code (even checking if there's been 24 hours since the last write may be too slow for them).</p>

<p>Still, thanks for all the answers so far, I'll see how I go. Give me a couple of days and I'll accept the best answer.</p>

The only thing we can rely on is HTTP port 80 (and HTTPS 443).</p>

<p>The design is basically modeled after XMPP (the Jabber protocol), using our client and IIS. The client issues GET requests to a .NET Handler; the handler holds the request open for a while looking for messages. If any messages arrive, they are immediately sent to the client; if not, after a timeout the connection is closed with a ""no-data"" response. The client immediately reopens the communication.</p>

<p>Well, theoretically.</p>

<p>What's actually happening is first, IIS can't handle more than about 100 simultaneous requests - others are all queued, and there can be a several minute lag between ""connected"" and IIS recognizing that the client called in. Second, about half the time the client times out without any response from the server (the client timeout is five minutes longer than the server's).</p>

<p>POST always works. Other data served on the same web server works. Web services on the same server work. This is an out-of-the-box installation on Windows 2K3 Server.</p>

<p>As far as I could find out, there's nothing wrong with JMS or .Net Messaging, it's just that they are for .Net / Java only.</p>

<p>The system should give me control over which transport mechanism (Sockets, Message Queues, etc.) to use when setting up a channel. I want to be able to both scale out to remote machines and speed things up with local transport facilities.</p>

<p>If I can't find anything suitable, I'll have to roll my own. I'd probably use Google's protocol buffers for serialization. If anybody has other recommendations for technology options, fire away.</p>

<p>Oh, yes - and I would like to have optional encryption on a per-channel or per-message basis.</p>

<p>Note that you will have to have an IBM user id to see the links, but signing up is free and I suspect many of you already have one.</p>

<p>I have downloaded every file on the page linked above. Websphere portal is made up of LOTS of parts including Websphere Application Server, The portal itself, an express version of db2. The installation never seems to get beyond the W-2 disk install, which is where it installs db2 express. The install fails with a pop up that simply says the install failed, check the log file. I did. The log file says that the db2 express install succeeded, but needs a reboot. The installer cannot do this apparently. Now, I am running the install from a user that is an admin on the local machine, but also belongs to the work domain I'm in. The installation does warn that there might be issues with doing this during the install, but it never says anything specific and I'm yet to find a detailed error on why the install failed.</p>

<p>I have verified that the portal's user id has a password that abides by our domain rules.</p>

<p>It might also be of note that I have a full version of db2 already installed on my machine but the install doesn't let seem to look for that, nor does it let me disable any of the installation components. I suppose I think this might it because the install process creates a db2user on the windows account. Since I've already got a full version installed, that user exists already.</p>

<p>If anyone has any thoughts at all as to why this install might be failing, I would love to hear about it. Thanks!</p>

<p>To be clear, by ""Enterprise"", I mean a large or very large company, where security, robustness, availability of skill sets, Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), scalability, and availability of tools are key considerations. Said another way, a company that looks for external adoption of frameworks / architecture - Something ubiquitous will be seen as more ""valid"" than something exotic / esoteric in this kind of environment.</p>

<p>I've seen use cases where Oracle, IBM, and Sun have implemented systems on the LAMP stack for various Enterprises. I've also seen examples where websites like yellowpages.com (Ruby on rails) and Facebook (php) are built on it. However, none of these examples are exactly what I'm looking for. </p>

<p>I'm really trying to find examples where it is an Enterprise standard at a very large bank (I.e., Citigroup), Telecom company (I.e., AT&amp;T), or manufacturer (I.e., Proctor and Gamble). Just to be clear, I'm not looking for an example where it's used in a limited sense (Like at JPMorgan Chase), but where it's a core platform for systems like CRM, manufacturing systems, or HR management, as well as for internal and external websites. </p>

<p>The perception I've seen so far is that applications built on the LAMP stack perform slower and are less flexible. Some of the arguments I've heard are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Linux is seen as not as well supported as Unix, Solaris, or Windows Servers.</p></li>
<li><p>Apache is harder to configure and maintain than web servers like BEA WebLogic or IIS.  </p></li>
<li><p>MySQL is a ""not ready for prime time"" DB for hobbyists, and not a competitor for SQL Server or Oracle (Although PostgreSQL seems to have a reputation for being more robust). </p></li>
<li><p>PHP / Ruby on rails are optimized for CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete operations). Although this is an advantage when building CRUD-intensive web aplications, both perform slower than Java/JEE or C# (which are both common Enterprise standards). Furthermore, a lot of applications and systems (like manufacturing systems) have a lot of non-CRUD functionality that may be harder to build with PHP or Ruby, or even Python. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Can anyone please provide arguments to support or refute the idea of the LAMP stack being appropriate for the Enterprise?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<ol>
<li>When I change the project build path and replace jface.jar with the source project (same version - 3.3.1), the error goes away.</li>
<li>Other applications I have that use the same jar, and a copy of the same launch profile and project, all works fine.</li>
<li>This is <strong>NOT</strong> a <code>ClassNotFoundException</code>.  The class is on the classpath.  If I attach source to the jar, I can debug into the getFontRegistry method.  The method will execute successfully several times before eventually throwing a <code>NoClassDefFoundError</code> on line 338.  Line 337 is a ""if variable == null"" statement checking to see if a static variable has been initialized.  Line 338 is initializing it if it is not already initialized.  The first time through, the null check fails, and the initialization is performed.  On subsequent passes through the method, the null check passes, and thus the already-initialized static value is returned.  On the final pass (the one that fails,) the null check fails again (even though the static variable has already been initialized) and when it tries to re-initialize the static variable, the <code>NoClassDefFoundError</code> is thrown.  Here is the relevant source (starting with line 336, note that fontRegistry is a private static variable that is set in no other place):</li>
</ol>

<p>.</p>

<pre><code>public static FontRegistry getFontRegistry() {
   if (fontRegistry == null) {
     fontRegistry = new FontRegistry(
         ""org.eclipse.jface.resource.jfacefonts"");
   }
   return fontRegistry;
}
</code></pre>

<p>.</p>

<ol>
<li>I have already gotten a fresh copy of the jar (to ensure it isn't corrupted,) deleted my .classpath and .project files and started a fresh project, and recreated the launch profile.  No change.</li>
</ol>

<p>Because of the peculiarities in #3 above, I'm suspecting some kind of wierd classloader behavior - it seems as if that final pass through the method is in another classloader?</p>

<p>Ideas?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>  The answer provided by Pourquoi Litytestdata prompted me to pay attention to what happens in the try block just above line 458 of ProgressMonitorDialog.  Indeed, that code was throwing an exception, which was being gobbled by the finally block.  The root cause was ANOTHER missing class (the missing class was not JFontRegistry or any of its directly related classes, but another that was spider-web dependencied in an edge case.)  I'm upvoting all answers pointing me to pay attention to the classpath, and accepting Pourquoi's, because it was the breakthrough.  Thanks to all.</p>

<p>I was tasked with writing a JSR168 compliant portlet to search a database. When you open the portlet, you're given 6 search boxes for different criteria to search several thousand records. Once you press search, it brings up another page (it keeps the first page and uses <code>&lt;jsp: include&gt;</code> for the second page so users can see/change their search terms) with the search results. From the search results page, the user can click on one of the results (which redirects to a new page) and get more detailed information about it.</p>

<p>All of that works. The problem is when the user wants to search again. </p>

<p>When I developed this, I used LifeRay installed on my local machine. Everything works perfectly in IE, Firefox, and Chrome. However, when I deploy it to our development portal (IBM WebSphere), it doesn't quite work in IE. In Firefox/Chrome, when a user is on the detailed information page, they can hit back on their browser and it loads a cached version of the search results. Perfect, because this content rarely changes.</p>

<p>However, in IE, when they click the back button on the detailed view, we get a ""Webpage has expired message"". I've tried every caching setting in the portal settings for the portlet as well as the page, but haven't had any luck.</p>

&lt;/body&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>I've also tried this with other action names, and no matter what, I get back a 404 page not found. I've tried this on both GlassFish and Websphere 6.1.1 with the same results, leading me to suspect that there is something I am missing that is probably right in front of me involving either directory structure (are the paths relative to the struts.xml file or the context root?) or some configuration file.</p>

<p>After some trying, I was able to get this up and running on Eclipse Ganymede on Mac OS X 10.5.6 using Glassfish, but I'm still having no luck with IBM Websphere and Application Server Toolkit (an Eclipse derivative) on Windows XP. I am a bit suspicious that this might have something to do with the browser. </p>

<p>I just tried adding a file called ""other.action"" to the same directory as my other JSP files mentioned above. Now when I click on the submit button that is linked to the ""other"" action, the action proceeds successfully to my test.jsp page. I may be incorrect, but I don't believe that I should have to give a file named ""someaction.action"" for every possible ""someaction"" that I may need to use (I know I didn't need it on the OS X run of my app).</p>

<p>More updates - I just tried it on Firefox 3.5.2 and running on that browser gave the same results - file not found without the ""other.action"" file on Websphere, so now I suspect it is a Websphere configuration issue.</p>

<p>While you can easily have different view modes inside your portlet, how can you link to another portlet and (maybe) also pass parameters along?</p>

<p><strong>I am not talking about plain communication between portlets, it's the real pageflow that interests me.</strong></p>

<p>Example:
You have page A with a portlet that displays a list of news items. Then you have page B that is in the way configured I'd like a single the news item to be shown (for example different portlets around it)</p>

<p>Is there a generic solution to link to page B and say to the news-Detail-Portlet that it should show item XYZ?</p>

<p>The quick and dirty solution would be to configure the target link via edit mode of the news-list-portlet. But this has several disadvantages:
- complex portlets may have several target URLs which leads to massive configuration efforts for the portal admin
- the urls may not follow a scheme that allows simple parameter injection</p>

<p>I have a solution in mind, but this would require massive efforts and maybe changes in the targeted portlets, which is not always possible if you use 3rd party portlets.</p>

<p>My solution would look like this: (draft!)</p>

<p>Portlets register at a central service with their portlet IDs and when a portlet wants to link to a portlet it can do a lookup based on a symbolic name. This would ease the pain for the admin, because it is possible to ""auto discover"" portlets. The service may also provide a UI to wire portlets based on source and target portlet.</p>

<p>The URL generation for portlets that can be changes may be solved via service call to the portlet that generates the URL as a whole with injected parameters and returns it.
For portlets that you can't change you have to append the parameters and hope that it works. :-/</p>

<p>Any suggestions? Are there simpler solutions? existing solutions?</p>

"801471","1","","","2009-04-29 08:44:50","3","4122","<p><em>First, just a bit of background:</em></p>

<p>One of our customers is experiencing CPU usage spikes for WebSphere instances running one of our web apps (other instances with other apps are fine). They have a test environment and a live environment (both iSeries) which both experience the problem - with a single app per instance setup. We have deployed this application locally in our own test environments and also for many other customers all on iSeries with no similar problems.</p>

<p><em>What's actually happening:</em></p>

<p>Every one second or so, the CPU usage for the WebSphere process' CPU usage jumps to anywhere from <code>7%</code>-<code>20%</code> even though there are no requests being processed at the time. Customer has reported seeing spikes as high as <code>30%</code>. These spikes average out to be <code>1.5%</code> of CPU overall - the other WebSphere instances typically use <code>0%</code>-<code>0.1%</code> when idle.</p>

<p><em>My investigations so far</em></p>

<p>So, I had a look at the threads. One thread in there test environment was using <code>~350</code> CPU cycles per second. A similar thread in their live environment was using <code>~1500</code> CPU cycles per second (showing that it has bigger CPU). The call stack for these threads looks like</p>

<pre><code>Type  Program                  Statement         Procedure                    
      QLESPI     QSYS          17                LE_Create_Thread2__FP12crtt &gt;
      QJVALIBJVM QSYS          7                 startThread__FPv             
 J    com/ibm/ws/util/Threa &gt;                    run                          
 J    com/ibm/ws/util/Threa &gt;                    run                          
 J    com/ibm/ws/util/Threa &gt;                    getTask                      
 J    com/ibm/ws/util/Bound &gt;                    poll
</code></pre>

<p>The entire class name from the bottom line is <code>com/ibm/ws/util/BoundedBuffer</code>. I asked the customer to do a JVM Dump for me - the only additional information I got from this was the thread name:</p>

<pre><code>Thread:  00002F82 Deferrable Alarm : 11
</code></pre>

<p><em>Now for my questions:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Can any of you identify the problem, given these symptoms? (Maybe that's a long shot!)</li>
<li>What is <code>Deferrable Alarm</code>? From the JVM Dump, I can see 4 threads with this name. The other three seem to be doing just fine. By debugging my local WebSphere (on Windows) and adding breakpoints in the <code>BoundedBuffer</code> class, I see that <code>BoudedBuffer</code>s are polling and periodically invoking some listener.</li>
<li>I don't have access to the WebSphere console for the customer machines, and they aren't owning up to having made any config changes. I can ask them to check the console for me though - what should I be asking them to look at?</li>
<li>I have telnet access to the customer boxes, is there anything else I can investigate here? Looking at the WebSphere profile files, etc? Which files should I be looking at?</li>
<li>Because the Call Stack and JVM Dump don't explicitly reference our code, is it safe to assume that this is a configuration problem?</li>
</ul>

<p>It's been a long question, so thanks for reading this far.</p>

<p><strong>30 April Update (1)</strong></p>

<p>This morning I've noticed that this behaviour only happens after the first request of the day has been processed (irrespective of which Web Service is invoked). This points the finger back at our application or Apache Axis. Could it be that this is just normal behaviour?!</p>

<p><strong>30 April Update (2)</strong></p>

<p>So it seems that this CPU activity is some kind of housekeeping activity for the web-container or maybe something within Apache Axis. I've now observed this happening on a few different web-applications on a few different servers. Applications with no web component don't suffer the same additional CPU overhead.</p>

<p>I'd imagine if it is housekeeping work, that ""tuning"" it somehow could be counter productive - by that, I mean that making the App Server idle better would probably negatively affect the amount of ""real"" work it can do.</p>

<p><strong>The first issue is:</strong></p>

<p>When the upload process finished i expect to find the uploaded file under the following path : myWebProjectRoot/upload/""sessionId""/fileName.ext</p>

<p>where the ""sessionId"" is a folder named with the current session id and the fileName.ex is the file uploaded by the user...</p>

<p>But  what i found is : the folder ""sessionId"" did not created and the file is stored directly on the upload folder..</p>

<p>My Configuration is like the configuration of the component-showcase of icefaces library which i deployed it on my server and it create the sessionId directory successfully....</p>

<p>i don't know what to do.. please help me...</p>

<p><strong>The second Issue is :</strong></p>

<p>When the session expired I expect the sessionId folder will be deleted, i modified the code of component-showcase in the class <em>InputFileSessionCleaner</em> and make it delete the folder and it's children recursevly form bottm to up, but some time i face the current problem :</p>

<p>Some files can not be deleted using my code -may be they are used by another process-, thus the folder will not be deleted because one of its children didn't deleted. so what to do in this case ... ? </p>

<p>There is an idea in my mind, which is: 
Is there any way to create a process running at the background in the server-side: this process check the upload directory and if it founds any file created from at least 60 minutes -which is my session time out period specified in web.xml- this process will delete this file.... </p>

<p>any one can help me.. every help will be appriciated .....</p>

<p><b>From profiling our application, we determined that the marshalling of this object (java object -> soap encoded xml) is the single greatest consumer of CPU cycles.</b> and since our Foo object isn't changing very often, remarshalling this object each time is unnecessary.</p>

<p><b>I figured this is a common optimization and wondered how others have addressed it.</b>
I briefly looked at the CXF docs and there is a Marshall interceptor which I could probably make use of.  I could create a Map which could map Foo objects to the XML encoded version.  But, then a few other issues come up like how do you remove objects from this Map once they are no longer needed etc.  It'd be nice if there was built in support for somehow detecting changes to the object and re-marshalling... Nothing impossible, but didn't want to reinvent the wheel.</p>

<p><B>EDIT (6/16/09)</b>: Have made some progress by making a custom BareOutInterceptor and modifying the Interceptor chain to call the custom one.  The custom adds some additional logic to only call the ""writeParts(....)"" method which performs the marshalling only the once for a given java object.  Will post solution once finished.

</code></pre>

<p>The query is pretty simple : it is as simple as </p>

<pre><code>select field1, field2 from &lt;xyz table&gt; where &lt;xyz_pk&gt; = ?
</code></pre>

<p>The primary key is a INTEGER(4) and has data that has values up to 99999999. But however, 
when I run this query is run in my web app on a connection obtained from websphere connection pool, it starts failing for pk values > 35k+.  In the jdbc binding code, I tried doing a preparedStatement.setInt() and preparedStatement.setFloat(). But nothing seems to work!! It just works for anything below 35k+ and fails for everything above that. </p>

<p>Java's int size is much bigger than 35k+, so why would this query fail with this error? This happens just from my application, when I try the same query with a database client of my choice, proper results are being obtained for all values of the pkey! </p>

<p>Did anyone faced this issue before? If yes, how did you get around it? </p>

<pre><code>2195 (X'0893')
MQRC_UNEXPECTED_ERROR
Explanation:

The call was rejected because an unexpected error occurred.
Completion Code:

MQCC_FAILED
Programmer Response:

Check the application's parameter list to ensure, for example, that the correct number of parameters was passed, and that data pointers and storage keys are valid. If the problem cannot be resolved, contact your system programmer.

    * On z/OS, check whether any information has been displayed on the console. If this error occurs on an MQCONN or MQCONNX call, check that the subsystem named is an active MQ subsystem. In particular, check that it is not a DB2(TM) subsystem. If the problem cannot be resolved, rerun the application with a CSQSNAP DD card (if you have not already got a dump) and send the resulting dump to IBM.
    * On OS/2 and i5/OS, consult the FFST record to obtain more detail about the problem.
    * On HP OpenVMS, Compaq NonStop Kernel, and UNIX systems, consult the FDC file to obtain more detail about the problem.

Still not a clue as what is the CLEAR demarcating difference between an Message Broker and an ESB? Now here I am trying to compare products, Websphere Broker and Mule ESB!!</p>

<p>Firstly , is (any version) Webshere Broker an ESB? Our IBM product guys claims it to be an ESB!(I am not surprised about that).</p>

<p>My limited information tells me that a Message Broker works on a HUB-SPOKE model. However the ESB works on a bus architecture. Now what on earth is that supposed to mean? I have read than if the HUB fails(unavailable I guess) then the broker completely fails. Which is not the case of an ESB(So those guys say). What I dont understand here is ""What if the BUS"" fails?</p>

<p>Now the usual stuff about an  ESBs and Brokers is that , they provide routing,transformation, orchestration etc.. So if both of them provide this, then why would I choose one over the other.</p>

<p>Another area of conflict is regarding the TRANSFORMATION. Does ESBs facilitate it in a different way when compared to Message Brokers? I would really love some insight on this.</p>

<p>Now talking about HORIZONTAL scaling. Who outperforms the whom? Or are both of them equally scalable in terms of complexity(or any other factors). Ofcourse cost wise, Webshpere Broker is gonna charge you for each box(let alone each cpu). I believe , even the commercial MULE ESB doesnt do that. Leaving aside the Cost part of it, what are the implications of ESB scaling and Message Broker scaling. I happen to know you can scale up to Service Level in ESB. Is this possible in a Message Broker?</p>

</ul>

<p>The libraries will be written in C#.  Spring.NET just released a milestone build with lots of nice messaging abstraction, which is great - I plan on using it extensively.  My basic question comes down to the question of message brokers.  My architecture will look something like app -> message broker queue -> server app that listens, dispatches all messages to where they need to go, and handles the life cycle of those long-lived messages -> message broker queue or topic -> listening apps.</p>

<p>Finally, the question:  Which message broker should I use?  I am biased towards <a href=""http://activemq.apache.org"" rel=""nofollow"">ActiveMQ</a> - We used it on our last project and loved it.  I can't really think of a single strike against it, except that it's Java, and will require java to be installed on a server somewhere, and that might be a hard sell to some of the people that will be using this service.  The other option I've been looking at is MSMQ.  I am biased against it for some unknown reason, and it also doesn't seem to have great multicast support.</p>

<p>Has anyone used MSMQ for something like this?  Any pros or cons, stuff that might sway the vote one way or the other?</p>

<p>The Java application is a standalone application (not deployed on any JEE application server like OracleAS,WebLogic,JBOSS etc).
By Stand Alone I mean its NOT a DESKTOP application. However it is run from the command line from a Main class. The user does not directly interact with this application at all. Messages are dumped into the queue using an API which is then read out by my Application which is constantly running 24/7. I wouldn't qualify this as a desktop app since the user has no direct interaction with it.(Not sure if this is the correct reasoning to qualify as one).</p>

<p>It uses Spring and connects to WebSphere MQ and Oracle Database
We use a Spring Listener(Spring Message Driven POJOs) which listens to a queue on WebSphere MQ. Once there is a message in the queue, the application read the message from the MQ and dumps(insert/update) it into the database.</p>

<p>Now the question is:</p>

<ol>
<li>How can we horizontally scale this application? I mean just putting more boxes and running multiple instances of this same application, is that a viable approach?</li>
<li>Should we consider moving from Spring MDPs to EJB MDBs? Thereby deploying it on the Application Server. Is there any added benefit by doing so?</li>
<li>There is a request to make the application High Available(HA)? What are the suggested methodologies or strategies that can be put in place to make a standalone application HA?</li>

Right now we're just hammering out some of the issues with the deployment process.

Stuff like loglevels, connection pools, etc.</p>

<p>So I was wondering how developers here structure their process for deploying webapps. Do you offload as much configuration as you can to the application server? Do you replace the settings files programmatically before deploying? Pick a version during build process? Manually edit the wars?</p>

<p>Also how far do you go in providing dependencies through the application servers' static libraries and how much do you put in the war themselves? All this just to get some ideas of what the common (or perhaps best) practice is at the moment.</p>

<p>The smaller files aren't causing too much of a problem but with the larger files it appears that it is being written into the heap which is then causing an OutOfMemory error and bringing down the entire server.</p>

<p>These files can only be served out to authenticated users over https which is why I am serving them through a Servlet instead of just sticking them in Apache.</p>

<p>The code I am using is (some fluff removed around this):</p>

<pre><code>    resp.setHeader(""Content-length"", """" + fileLength);
    resp.setContentType(""application/vnd.ms-excel"");
    resp.setHeader(""Content-Disposition"",""attachment; filename=\""export.csv\"""");

        do

<p>The FileInputStream doesn't seem to be causing a problem as if I write to another file or just remove the write completly the memory usage doesn't appear to be a problem.</p>

<p>What I am thinking is that the resp.getOutputStream().write is being stored in memory until the data can be sent through to the client. So the entire file might be read and stored in the resp.getOutputStream() causing my memory issues and crashing!</p>

<p>I have tried Buffering these streams and also tried using Channels from java.nio, none of which seems to make any bit of difference to my memory issues. I have also flushed the outputstream once per iteration of the loop and after the loop, which didn't help.</p>

<p>I'm quite familiar with the base API of Java, but I don't have much experience in using Java for Web environments (though I've used ASP.NET), so I'm looking for some advice:</p>

<li><p><em>What <strong>web application server</strong> should I use?</em> Note that my interface is very light, and I just want something that is fast, easy to start/reset/stop and (re)deploy my application. Also, I need it to work on <strong>multiple environments</strong>, namely, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows XP/Vista. Additionally, I'm using <code>ant</code> and <code>Eclipse</code>, so it would be great if I could easily add some <code>ant</code> targets for server management, and/or manage the server using the IDE. I've looked into <strong>Tomcat</strong> and <strong>Jetty</strong>, and the latter seems to be very light and easy to install and deploy. This is ideal, because the GUI is just for demonstration purposes, and I'll probably need to deploy it in different computers. However, Tomcat has been around for a very long time, and it seems more mature.</p></li>
<li><p>As for the <strong>web pages</strong>, Java Server Pages look like a good fit, as they seem sufficiently simple for what I'm trying to accomplish (processing a form and outputting the result), but I'm all ears for suggestions. </p></li>
<li>I also have another requirement, which requires me to explain the ""basic"" workflow of the application: Basically, I have a class <code>Engine</code> which has a method <code>run(String)</code> which will process the user's input and return the results for display. This class is the <em>core</em> of the application. Now, I'd like to <strong>instantiate</strong> this class <strong>only once</strong>, as it requires a <strong>lot</strong> of memory, and takes a very long time to startup, so I'd like to create it when the application/server starts, and store that reference for the entire span of the application (i.e., until I stop the server). Then, for each user request, I'd simply invoke the <code>run</code> method of the <code>Engine</code> instance, and display its results. <em>How can this be accomplished in Java?</em></li>

<ol>
<li><p>create single queue where client posts to</p></li>
<li><p>set up two ""intermediate"" queues</p></li>
<li><p>use a custom ""DuplicatorMDB"" that will read messages from the client queue and post them to two queues within the same transaction.</p></li>
</ol>

<pre>
client->JMSDQ->DuplicatorMDB->Q1->MDB->System1
                           \->Q2->MDB->System2
</pre>

<p>Is there any existing functionality like that? What would be the proper way to balance the system to keep it stable if one or both of the backend systems are down?</p>

<p>The application server is WebLogic 10. </p>

<p>I can't use topics for this because in a cluster topics will cause too much message duplication. If we have 2 instances, then with topics it'll go like this: </p>

<pre> 
client->Topic-->MDB1@server1->System1
           | \->MDB2@server1->System2 
           \---->MDB1@server2->System1 
            \--->MDB2@server2->System2 
</pre>

<p>Thus every message will be delivered twice to System1 and twice to System2 and if there'll be 8 servers in a cluster, each message will be delivered 8 times. This is what I'd really like to avoid...</p>

<p>Finally I got some time to test it and here is what I observed:
2 nodes in a cluster. 2 JMS servers: jms1 on node1, jms2 on node2.
Distributed topic dt. MDB with durable subscription and jms-client-id=durableSubscriber. Started the system: 0 messages, mdb@node1 is up, mdb@node2 trying to connect periodically, but it can't because ""Client id, durableSubscriber, is in use"". As expected.</p>

<p>Sent in 100 messages:
jms1@dt messages current = 0, messages total = 100, consumers current = 1
I can see that node1 processed 100 messages.<br />
jms2@dt messages current = 100, messages total = 100 , consumers current = 1
i.e. ""duplicate"" messages are pending in the topic.</p>

<p>Sent in another 100 messages, 100 were processed on the node1, 200 pending on node2.</p>

<p>Rebooted node1, mdb@node2 reconnected to dt and started processing ""pending"" messages. 200 messages were processed on node2. </p>

<p>After node1 is up, mdb@node1 can't connect to the dt, while mdb@node2 is connected. </p>

<p>jms1@dt messages current=0, messages total = 0, consumers current = 0<br />
jms2@dt messages current=0, messages total = 200, consumers current = 1</p>

<p>Send in 100 more messages, I see that all 100 messages are processed on node2 and discarded on node1.</p>

<p>jms1@dt messages current=0, messages total = 100, consumers current = 0<br />
jms2@dt messages current=0, messages total = 300, consumers current = 1</p>

<p>Now I reboot node2, mdb@node1 reconnects to dt. After reboot mdb@node2 reconnects to dt and mdb@node1 gets disconnected from dt. </p>

<p>jms1@dt messages current=0, messages total = 100, consumers current = 1<br />
jms2@dt messages current=0, messages total = 0, consumers current = 1</p>

<p>I send in 100 messages, all are processed on node2 and stored in the topic on node1:</p>

<p>jms1@dt messages current=100, messages total = 200, consumers current = 1<br />
jms2@dt messages current=0, messages total = 0, consumers current = 1</p>

<p>Then I shut down node2 and I see 100 ""pending messages"" being processed on node1 after mdb@node1 reconnects to the topic.</p>

<p>So the result is:
I sent 400 messages, 700 were processed by MDB out of which 300 were duplicates.</p>

<p>It looks like the MDB reconnection works good as expected, but the messages may be duplicated if a node hosting the ""active"" MDB goes down. </p>

<p>This might be a bug or a feature of weblogic JMS implementation.</p>

This is for personal use, more to gain skills than to accomplish essential functionality.  I have my own Linux server (Ubuntu Jaunty x86_64) with business class internet, so I can install pretty much anything. </p>

<p>I use Tomcat a lot now, however, I ran into a few situations lately job hunting where they were looking for experience in a specific J2EE container (which defeats the whole purpose of having a standard), and of course not the same one each time. </p>

<ol>
<li>Is in demand in the marketplace right now</li>
<li>Is free (or 
<li>Is not too horrendous (disk space, time) to install and to deploy applications on</li>
<li>Runs on Ubuntu x86_64</li>

I also see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/252082/what-would-be-the-best-way-to-match-up-two-object-instances-between-two-different"">from this SO post</a> that WebSphere is a steaming pantload of bloatware that's hard to deploy/configure, but I don't know if that's accurate or current.  I like Tomcat (completely FOSS, smallish, easy to deploy, plenty of docs/users), but it's less in demand than some of the bigger boys.</p>

<p>So what would you recommend I install?  Thanks in advance.</p>

(Actually one is WebSphere Application Server V6.1 with EJB 3.0 and Web Services feature packs, and the other server is WebSphere ESB Server V6.2).  However, I know that ESB is really built on top of WAS, so it has all the configuration settings that a regualr WAS server has.</p>

<p>In my ESB server, I am trying to expose a service written as EJB 3.0 that will be deployed to the WAS 6.1 server.  My question is not how to get EJB 2.1 calls to call into an EJB 3.0. We've done that already.  My question is how to call across physical VM's.  The WebSphere Application Server is running in its own cell/node/server from the ESB Server.  From what I've read in IBM documentation, it is possible to set up a namespace binding on WAS to point to a remote EJB on another WAS instance.  Thus you could use JNDI to lookup a bean on one WAS instance that really resides in another WAS instance.  The beauty of this method is the location of the EJB you want is abstracted to the container level, and you don't have to drag around properties files of the IP addresses and ports that you need to access the bean should it change servers, etc.  You just make a standard JNDI lookup to a remote EJB and you get it.</p>

<p>Sounds like it can be done.  (See the following links: 
<a href=""http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.express.doc/info/exp/ae/tnam_view_bindings.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v6r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.express.doc/info/exp/ae/tnam_view_bindings.html</a>)  Especially follow the links on EJB and Indirect namespace bindings.</p>

<p>But I've been hitting my head against this for a while.  It makes sense.  It looks like it can be done.  And the Indirect namespace binding looks the most promising.  But I can't get it to work quite right.  My ESB server keeps complaining about not finding comp/env/ejb in the context in which I am asking for it.  Very puzzled by this one.</p>

<p>Just wondering if anybody has done this kind of thing before.  Can you give me a concrete example of how you set this up in WAS to do so?  Any help is appreciated</p>

What is the best and easiest way to have two servers share client state information with only one receiving client traffic?</p>

<p>Is there any other way to do this? I thought of having a common/shared place to store state information where both servers can read client state information from. But this doesn't work well as the shared space is a single point of failure too.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Is is appropriate to use traditional infrastructure logging frameworks (like log4net) to log <em>business events</em>?</strong></p>

<p>When I say business events, I mean I want a global log like this:</p>

<pre><code>xx:xx Customer A purchased widget B.
xx:xx Widget B was dispatched from warehouse.
xx:xx Customer B payment declined.
</code></pre>

<p>Most traditional infrastructure logging frameworks have event levels something like this:</p>

<pre><code>FATAL
ERROR
WARN
INFO
DEBUG
</code></pre>

<p>An of course these messages don't fit well into that.  Best description would be INFO, but of course these are important events, and INFO is of very low importance.</p>

<p>I would still like this as a 'log' (e.g. I don't want to have to extract this from my business objects each time I want to see it)</p>

<p>Seems to me I have two options:</p>

<p>1) Use a framework like log4net and just define a special logger for this (and live with the fact that it doesn't feel right). </p>

<p>2) Provide a service for performing this that doesn't rely on a traditional logging services.</p>

<p>I'm leaning towards 2.  What has anyone else done in a similar situations?</p>

My manager currently believes that design is important, but not crucial for all but the most ambitious projects.  It is my opinion that he thinks it is important to design, but not necessary and that big ball of mud programming can 'get the job done.'</p>

<p>What are some methods of discussing (topics, examples, etc) the importance of planning and design?  I'm looking for things to do, say, or change that are within my power as 'code peon', so answers such as, hire another senior, fire weak members, etc. aren't very helpful to me.</p>

<p>Alternatively, is he right and I'm the one who should rethink my approach to development?</p>

<p><strong>Some background:</strong><br />
Essentially, our team consists of three strong developers, a few weak developers, and some people who, in my opinion, shouldn't even be in the field.</p>

<p>We have no dedicated architect, so the three strongest developers who act as unofficial team leads are somewhat looked to in order to design all but the most trivial of projects, unless the manager decides that 'ball of mud' is good enough.  They are also responsible for their own (some times multiple) ongoing projects while mentoring and helping others.  This leads to an acceptable, but full work-load from week to week on these individuals.</p>

<p>My point of describing the background is three-fold for this team:</p>

<ol>
<li>There is little time to peer-program, give training sessions, and code reviews have fallen off the map.  In other words, the weak must learn on their own.</li>
<li>When the weaker members are given a project and allowed to simply start coding without thought, the development takes longer, spends way more time in QA, and is such a maintenance headache later, the senior three are scared to even touch it.</li>
<li>The weak team members generally have the attitude but not the aptitude, or vice versa, but no one among them seems to have both.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>To summarize:</strong><br />
The manager is an intelligent, though stubborn man who will listen to reason, but you must convince him thoroughly of the 'why'.<br />
There is not enough time currently to inject any training methods that take away from daily duties of development and no one is likely to be hired anytime soon to alleviate some burden.<br />
The only current method of creating better code with the individuals that are available on the team is by designing their projects for them and guiding them through the process of implementation, thus, we have this question.</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>  

<p>I wanted to consolidate what I've taken from the answers so far; Some of these are intuitive, but not something most think about from day-to-day (imo):</p>

<p><strong>Managers like metrics.</strong>  True, but as M. Fowler believes (and I agree) productivity and quality is immeasurable.  Besides, I don't have the means to accumulate the metrics as 'peon'.  (thanks Novelocrat &amp; duffymo).</p>

<p><strong>There will always be a mix of talent, you must present a learning environment</strong>  We are supportive in this in attitude, but I think other tools are needed to create this environment. (thanks duffymo).</p>

<p><strong>Engage the weak, alleviate the workload of the strong</strong> In addition (as a result of?) to presenting the learning environment, engage the weaker developers in strengthening their design skills by giving them small, atomic parts of the project to design (with approval) themselves.  This removes responsibility from the stronger devs, teaches the weaker, and may be an acceptable solution for the manager as it doesn't take time from his higher paid employees. (thanks duffymo &amp; Tom Anderson)</p>

<li>expose this add method as a webservice</li>
<li>consume this webservice from another EJB</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two steps are easy and I can deploy and test this bean to Glassfish v2.1 already and test it with a standalone client:</p>

Our application is Java 1.5 compatible and will be deployed to WAS ND 6.1.0.21 with EBJ 3.0 and Web Services feature packs. The configuration is currently one cell with two clusters. Each cluster will have two nodes.</p>

<p>Our application, or our system, as I should rather say, comes in two or three parts.</p>

<p>Part 1: An ear deployed to one cluster that contains 3rd party vendor code combined with customization code. Their code is EJB 2.0 compliant and has a lot of Remote Home interfaces.</p>

<p>Part 2: An ear deployed to the same cluster as the first ear. This ear contains EBJ 3's that make calls into the EJB 2's supplied by the vendor and the custom code. These EJB 3's are used by the JSF UI also packaged with the EAR, and some of them are also exposed as web services (JAX-WS 2.0 with SOAP 1.2 compliance) for other clients.</p>

<p>Part 3: There may be other services that do not depend on our vendor/custom code app. These services will be EJB 3.0's and web services that are deployed to the other cluster.</p>

<p>Per a recommendation from some IBM staff on site here, communication between nodes in a cluster can be EJB RMI. But if we are going across clusters and/or other cells, then the communication should be web services.</p>

<p>That said, some of us are wondering about performance and optimizing communication for speed of our applications that will use our web services and EJB's. Right now most EJB's are exposed as remote. (and our vendor set theirs up that way, rather than also exposing local home interfaces). We are wondering if WAS does any optimizations between apps in the same node/cluster node space. If two apps are installed in the same area and they call each other via remote home interface, is WAS smart enough to make it a local home interface call?</p>

<p>Are their other optimization techniques? Should we consider them? Should we not? What are the costs/benefits? Here is the question from one of our team members as sent in their email:</p>

<p>The question is: Supposing we develop our EJBs as remote EJBs, where our UI controller code is talking to our EXT java services via EJB3...what are our options for performance optimization when both the EJB server and client are running in the same container?</p>

<p>As one point of reference, google has given me some oooooold websphere performance tuning documentation from 2000 that explains a tuning configuration you can set to enable Call By Reference for EJB communication when they're in the same application server JVM. It states the following:</p>

<p>Because EJBs are inherently location independent, they use a remote programming
model. Method parameters and return values are serialized over RMI-IIOP and returned
by value. This is the intrinsic RMI ""Call By Value"" model.</p>

<p>WebSphere provides the ""No Local Copies"" performance optimization for running EJBs
and clients (typically servlets) in the same application server JVM. The ""No Local
Copies"" option uses ""Call By Reference"" and does not create local proxies for called
objects when both the client and the remote object are in the same process. Depending
on your workload, this can result in a significant overhead savings.</p>

<p>Configure ""No Local Copies"" by adding the following two command line parameters to
the application server JVM:</p>

<pre><code>* -Djavax.rmi.CORBA.UtilClass=com.ibm.CORBA.iiop.Util
* -Dcom.ibm.CORBA.iiop.noLocalCopies=true
</code></pre>

<p>CAUTION: The ""No Local Copies"" configuration option improves performance by
changing ""Call By Value"" to ""Call By Reference"" for clients and EJBs in the same JVM.
One side effect of this is that the Java object derived (non-primitive) method parameters
can actually be changed by the called enterprise bean. Consider Figure 16a:</p>

<p>Also, we will also be using Process Server 6.2 and WESB 6.2 as well in the future. Any ideas? recommendations?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I tried <code>mail.smtp.password</code> property, but it doesn't work. Sun documentation says there is no property for password (although I've seen <code>mail.smtp.password</code> in some examples). So how should I do it? Is it possible to have login/password information configured on server, not in application?  </p>

<p>EDIT<br>
All of you suggest some properties files. I don't want them. I have a mail session on my application server. I get this session by JNDI. I can configure there host to use to send mails and so on. But I can't put there password. It doesn't work. I want all of the configuration to be done by Weblogic console. How to achieve that?</p>

<p>I'm starting a new project to be run on WebSphere Application Server 6.1 (actually Portal Server 6.1, but it's WAS 6.1 under the hood - whatever).  I usually use java.util.logging for my WAS projects and everything is fine.  This customer is a SLF4J fan and wants to use that.  Fair enough, sounds easy.</p>

<p>So, I deploy slf4j-api-1.5.8.jar and slf4j-jdk14-1.5.8.jar in my WEB-INF/lib directory.  In my code I do a --</p>

<pre><code>// These classes are coming from org.slf4j.*
private static Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyClass.class);
...
log.debug(""This is a log message"");
</code></pre>

<p>As expected I get an entry in the SystemOut.log.  However, it's the format of that message that I can't figure out.  A sample would be --</p>

<pre><code>[12/15/09 15:43:15:071 EST] 00000042 MyClass D com.example.MyClass This is a log message
</code></pre>

<p>Let me explain what's in that sample log entry.  I assume everything to the left of <strong>com.example.MyClass</strong> is coming from the j.u.l formatter.  Everything to the right of it is what I included in my log.debug().  So, who's adding the <strong>com.example.MyClass</strong>?  Only thing I can think is that SLF4J is adding it before it passes the message through to the underlying j.u.l.</p>

<p>It's the <strong>com.example.MyClass</strong> part that's irritating me.  I don't want that included in the SLF4J-generated log message.  The class name is already included, so it's extra fluff that's not needed.  Plus, the real package names are quite long and their inclusion just pushes the real meat of the log entry too far off to the right.</p>

<p>When I use just plain java.util.loggging, the log entry is exactly the same <em>except</em> that the ""com.example.MyClass"" piece is not included.  Exactly as I want!</p>

<p><strong>So, the question is - how can I get rid of this extra class name entry in the log messages generated via SLF4J under WAS?</strong></p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

I have never worked in a project that involved more than one developer or were as big and complex as these ones.</p>

<p>The problem is that they don't use all the tools available (version control, automated building, continuous integration, etc) to their full extent: mainly a project is one big project in eclipse/netbeans using cvs for version control and everything checked in (including library jars), they started using branching for the first time when I started doing branches for small tasks and merging them back. As the projects get bigger and more complex, problems start to arise with dependencies, project structure tied to an IDE, building can be a PITA sometimes, etc. It's hectic at best.</p>

<p>What I want is to set up a development environment where most of these problems will go away and I will save time and effort. I would like to set up projects in a manner independent of IDE used using version control (I'm leaning towards SVN right now), avoid dependency messes and automate building as much as possible.</p>

<p>I know that there are multiple approaches and tools for this and do not want to see a holy war started, I would really appreciate practical recommendations based on experience and what you have found to be useful when facing similar problems. All projects are Java projects and range from web applications to ""generic"" ones, and I use Eclipse most of the time, but also use Netbeans if needed. Thanks in advance.</p>

However, I do know that this webapp is being served by an Apache Server/ IIS Server / IBM Http Server. Now, I would like to have a plugin/ module / add-on at the web-server end, which would parse/truncate/cut/regex the http response (based on the requested url's pattern), and mask(encrypt/shuffle/substitute) a set of fields in this response based on different parameters(user's LDAP permissions in the intranet / user's geo-location if on the internet, etc) and send the altered response back to the user.</p>

<p>So, Is there an easy answer to creating such plugins/modules/add-ons? How feasible is this approach of creating extra software at the webserver, when you want to mask sensitive information in a webapp without modfying the web-app code? Are there any tools that help you do this for Apache? </p>

Are there any free or free-to-try software packages out there that will generate a flow chart for a COBOL program?</p>

<p>I've looked at ""Visustin"" and ""Code Visual to Flowchart""</p>

<p>Visustin blanks out part of the code and does random rotations in the demo version, which causes the demo to be less accurate.</p>

<p>UPDATE (4/26/10): I followed Bert's suggestion and removed JAVA_HOME from the PATH environment var in /etc/profile.  After doing this, I was able to use alternatives to change the version of Java.  The only problem is that when I try to run <code>javac</code>, I get ""-bash: javac: command not found"".  This does not happen when the version is set to 1.5.</p>

<p>How can I implement this parallelization with EJBs? I know that we should not create threads in a EJB method. Instead, we should publish messages (one per job) to be consumed by message driven beans (MDBs). But then it would not be a synchronous call anymore.

I add a reference to the progress listener to the session as well.</p>

<p>From the JSP page as soon as I fire the submit on the form, after 1 second and then every second I fire an ajax request which goes to a servlet which looks up the ProgressListener and responds with the percentage field.

<p>I've been asked to give an advise regarding which approach to take, in terms of J2EE development between Spring 3.0 and J2EE 6.0.  I was, and still am, a promoter of Spring 2.5 over classic J2EE 5 development, specially with JBoss, I even migrated old apps to Spring and influenced the re-definition of the development policy here to include Spring specific APIs, and helped the development of a strategic plan to foster more lightweight solutions like Spring + Tomcat, instead of the heavier ones of JBoss, right now, we're using JBoss merely as a Web container, having what i call the ""container inside the container paradox"", that is, having Spring apps, with most of its APIs, running inside JBoss, So we're in the process of migrating to tomcat.</p>

<p>However, with the coming of J2EE 6.0 many features, that made Spring attractive at that time, easy deployment, less-coupling, even some sort of D.I, etc,  seems to have been mimicked, in one way or the other. JSF 2.0, JPA 2.0, WebBeans, WebProfiles, etc. </p>

<p>So, the question goes...</p>

<p>From your point of view, how save, and logical, it is to continue to invest in a non-standard J2EE development framework like Spring given the new perspectives offered by J2EE 6.0?</p>

<p>Can we talk about maybe 3 or 4 more years of Spring development, or do you recommend early adoption of J2EE 6.0 APIs and it's practices?</p>

<p>I know within JBoss, the provider is Hibernate so it probably doesn't matter.  However, I <em>think</em> the provider within WebLogic is Eclipselink.  I have no idea what the provider WebSphere or Glassfish use, but I have seen detailed instructions on how to use Hibernate as the provider within those application servers.</p>

<p>I guess another way to ask the question is what would we be missing by using Hibernate in these application servers?</p>

<p>Last year I started working at a medium-sized auto insurance company -- we're in several states, but we're not as big as GEICO or Progressive or anything like that (yet).  Our primary software system is old (written in RPG) but reasonably stable.  We're wanting to make our in-house applications available via the web (both intra- and internet), and we're going to be writing new Java code to access the underlying programs.</p>

<p>I've heard a lot about Enterprise Java Beans , and it seems like there's times they may be beneficial (depending on which article I'm reading to research them).  However, I've looked into them and I just can't seem to get a grasp on how to started.  I've looked up lots of tutorials, but (like a lot of programming areas) they're either to simplistic to give me any idea of how EJB's could benefit my projects or they're too complex and my eyes start to glaze over.  It's a little disheartening, as I've worked with Java for about a decade now and I felt that I was at least able to easily catch on to things I didn't know about.</p>

<p>So, here's the questions I have:</p>

<ol>
<li>How can I tell if using EJB's would be of any benefit to any development projects I'm working on?</li>
<li>If I'm designing an application from scratch, what would be a good way to implement EJB's -- or what would be a good way to look at my application to start designing EJB's?</li>
<li>What questions <em>should</em> I be asking, if either of these others aren't really appropriate?</li>
</ol>

<p>We're using WebSphere (6.1) as our primary deployment server, and most of the Java development is done in IBM Rational Application Developer (7.1, I believe) -- it's a flavor of Eclipse, for anyone who's never heard of it before.</p>

<p>If I need to clarify anything, please let me know.</p>

<p>Anybody had any experience with any of the above and found the documentation to be clear to a beginner?  Being a JSF/Web beginner, I tried some ICEFaces, Mojarra tutorials and had a go at getting RichFaces working with NBeans and GlassFish, but no luck.  Lots of XML complaints. I'm clearly missing some huge chunks of configuration, but I can't find any documentation to help me.</p>

<p>Any suggestions would be much appreciated :-)</p>

So here's the situation : I use JSF 1.2 by IBM on RAD with Websphere v6.1 I have a custom component (from the company layer) to use tabs.
And in order to have a cleaner code, I just want to separate the JSF code of each tab in a separated JSP, this way, main.jsp :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;customTag:tabComponent&gt;
&lt;jsp:include page=""/jsp/workflow/tab1.jsp""&gt;&lt;/jsp:include&gt;
&lt;div align=""right""&gt;
    &lt;customTag:switchToTab title=""Next"" tabValue=""2""&gt;&lt;/customTag:switchToTab&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/customTag:tabComponent&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And my tab1.jsp :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- Taglibs declared here --&gt;
&lt;f:verbatim&gt;
&lt;div id=""myDivId""&gt;
    &lt;fieldset&gt;
        &lt;legend&gt;myLegend&lt;/legend&gt;
        &lt;h:outputText value=""#{myBean.someContent}""&gt;&lt;/h:outputText&gt;
        &lt;!-- HERE are a lot of JSF components, selectItems, inputText... --&gt;
    &lt;/fieldset&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/f:verbatim&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So the JSF components are processed, but HTML seems to be treated after and appears after, outside of the HTML generated by JSF. Something like</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;!-- generated content --&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div id=""myDivId""&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>although the table should be inside the div. I tried to use the <code>&lt;f:verbatim&gt;</code> tag different ways, and the only solution was to surround <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> by the verbatim opening and closing tags, which is dirty and makes Websphere going crazy.</p>

<p>Google did not find anything relevant, so have you guys already encountered the same issue? Is it possible to find a clean solution or do I have to include all my code inside the same JSP? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Syntax wise everything is perfect. The problem is, when I activated the ajax for my community, there is a build up of 30 - 40 SLEEP commands in the MySQL database. All of which seem to ignore the set timeout of 10 seconds. It effects the entire site's performance as a result. </p>

<p>My understanding is that left over sleep commands are the result of a connection that hasn't been closed.

Everything is by the text book and double checked against the documentation, and I've made sure that every little piece of the MySQLi class is closed and released. </p>

<p>So it seems that this problem would be related to the JRE I'm using, but what doesn't seem to make sense is that the non-IBM JRE works fine, but the IBM JRE does not. Any ideas, or suggestions?</p>

<p>I guess the first part of this question is, does Sun One Application Server v9.1 isolate EJBs from each other? I was under the impression that it does. But it seems like another application loaded dep-vB.jar and this EJB is directly using it without loading its own. </p>

<p>The second question is, if the app server does isolate EJBs, does it load dependencies from the EJB's jar file before looking in the application server's lib folders? I was under the impression that this is also true, but maybe not...</p>

<p>Is anyone familiar enough with Sun application servers to explain why dep-vB.jar is being loaded rather than dep-vA.jar? Is there any way to get it to load dep-vA.jar without changing what's in the application server's lib folders?

<p>I don't know how to specify the remote server address and I'd be glad to get some links to tutorials or maybe a working Ant snippet to deploy an EAR to the websphere server.</p>

<p>We already have some SCP and SSHEXEC tasks running for the portlets, and they're calling the <em>XMLAccess</em> interface to place and start the portlets. Do I have to adapt that scripts for the EAR too or is that a completely wrong way to automatically deploy an EAR file?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>

<p>I rewrote my ant script and now there is no ClassNotFoundException anymore. Still, there is an unexpected behavior: The script wants to use a profile I never specified...</p>

<p>The classes for the objects I'm retrieving/submitting were generated from XSD files via the xjc tool.  The part I'm stuck on is turning one of those objects into an XML tree to submit to the webservice.</p>

<p>When I retrieve/send a request from/to the ws, it contains a 'payload' object.  This is defined in java code as (partial listing):</p>

<pre><code>@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)
@XmlType(name = ""PayloadType"", propOrder = {
    ""compressed"",
    ""document"",
    ""any"",
    ""format""
})
public class PayloadType {

    @XmlElement(name = ""Compressed"")
    protected String compressed;
    @XmlElement(name = ""Document"")
    protected List&lt;String&gt; document;
    @XmlAnyElement
    protected List&lt;Element&gt; any;
    protected String format;

    public List&lt;Element&gt; getAny() {
        if (any == null) {
            any = new ArrayList&lt;Element&gt;();
        }
        return this.any;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>The only field I'm concerned with is the 'any' field which contains an XML tree.  When I retrieve data from the ws, I read that field with something like this: 
    ('root' is of org.w3c.dom.Element type and is the result of calling 'getAny().get(0)' on the payload object)</p>

<pre><code>NodeList nl = root.getElementsByTagName(""ns1:Process""); // ""ns1:Process"" is an XML node to do something with
if (nl != null &amp;&amp; nl.getLength() &gt; 0) {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; nl.getLength(); i++) {
        Element proc = (Element) nl.item(i);
        try {
            // do something with the 'proc' Element here...
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            // handle problems here...
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Submitting data is where I'm stuck.  How do I take a java object created from one of the classes generated from XSD and turn it into an Element object that I can add to the 'any' List of the payload object??  For instance, if I have a DailyData class and I create and populate it with data:</p>

<pre><code>DailyData dData = new DailyData();
dData.setID = 34;
dData.setValues = ""3,5,76,23"";
</code></pre>

<p>How do I add that 'dData' object to the 'any' List of the payload object?  It has to be an Element.  Do I do something with a JAXBContext marshaller?  I've used that to dump the 'dData' object to the screen to check the XML structure.</p>

<p>I'm sure the answer is staring me in the face but I just can't see it!</p>

<p>Dave</p>

<p>UPDATE:  Got it working with the below code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
Document doc = dbf.newDocumentBuilder().newDocument();

JAXBContext context = JAXBContext.newInstance(DailyData.class);
Marshaller marshaller = context.createMarshaller();
marshaller.marshal(dData, doc);


PayloadType payload = new PayloadType();
payload.getAny().add((Element)doc.getFirstChild());

It is possible that hundreds of such messages will arrive in a short period of time which need to be processed ASAP.</p>

<p>However, it is also possible that certain remote systems are not available when the message is received, so they should be postponed until later (eg. 1 hour or so). The best solution would be to put the message back to the queue with some ""delay"" value set, which will tell the JMS broker not to try to deliver the message again within an hour.</p>

<p>What is not OK: sleep in the receiving thread and wake up an hour later. Since the message consumer pool is limited (eg. 8 connections available) having 8 non-reachable systems would block the whole processing unnecessarily, which is unacceptable.</p>

<p>I didn't find a setting for either the message or the queue itself for such a ""delay"" value, does it exist? </p>

I'm primarily a .Net developer with limited experience in Java.  I have a WCF web service that needs to communicate with a 3rd party Message Queue Server in order to send and receive files.   The 3rd party has provided a Java API in order to access their Message Queue Server.   </p>

<p>I've done some research into the best way to move forward and now I'd like to get some feedback from anyone with experience with a similar situation.  </p>

<p>After some digging I determined that one option is to create a java web service in Eclipse and host it on Glassfish.  This java webservice would reference:</p>

<ol>
<li>The java api provided by the 3rd party thus allowing the 3rd party to send the xml files to us.</li>
<li>My existing WCF service in order to pass along the xml to be processed.   </li>
</ol>

<p>So the incoming xml file would flow as follows:</p>

<p>3rd party -> Java WS -> WCF WS</p>

<p>This incoming flow is only half the equation since my WCF web service can also initiate communiation with the third party. So I need an outgoing flow as well. </p>

<ol>
<li>One option would be to reference the Java WS from my WCF service.   However then the 2 web services would each be referencing each other.  Is this considered a circular reference (bad practice) when 2 web services reference one another?  </li>
<li>If option 1. is considered bad practice, my other option would be to have one of the web services poll the other service.</li>
<li>Other options?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Summary Questions</strong>
1. Any insight into the circular web reference question above?
2. Am I on the right track in general?
3. Any suggestions or personal experience you can provide?</p>

<p>Your insight is very much appreciated.</p>

<p>The application has traditionally required that some post installation configuration changes be made. </p>

<p>This was easy with the Oracle 10G OAS as the EAR was exploded into a directory thus allowing easy access to configuration files. </p>

<p>With 11G, the EAR is not exploded resulting in additional documentation on exploding, modifying, and recombining the EAR.</p>

<p>It seems to me that this must be a relatively common problem with a solution, perhaps a standard one through J2EE, that I have simply not come across or recognized it as the solution I was looking for.</p>

<p>Some alternatives include:
1) Providing a utility that will modify the EAR file prior to deployment.
2) Store all configuration settings in a separate location.
3) Store all configuration settings in a database; access the database via a container provide connection exposed through JNDI.</p>

<p>But is there an established best practice?</p>

<p>Lacking that, what approach has worked for you?</p>

However, I can't find anything that tells me an easy, reliable way to deploy dependencies to a container. For instance, I have an application that uses CXF and several Spring subprojects. If I need to deploy this application to a new Glassfish server, what would be the best way to do so, ensuring that all dependencies get installed? </p>

<p>I'm using Maven, and it would <em>seem</em> that there could be some way to have a hook that looks at the META-INF/maven directory and pulls the dependency list from the pom.xml and goes and fetches the required libs (probably from a local repo). Is there a way to do that?</p>

"1337658","1","","","2009-08-26 21:40:54","0","48","<p>At my place of work a few people think it's OK to have platform specific configuration items (things like back-end host names/IP addrs, DB connection details etc)
imbedded (as .properties file(s) ) in application packages (a Web App .war file). I think this is a bad bad thing for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>there needs to be a separate package for each target platform (could be a dev lab, a model lab, production etc)</li>
<li>build overhead - build scripts typically build a set of target app packages (they all get built at the same time on the assumption that this version is the final version)</li>
<li>management effort (eg source/version control) of configuration items needs (in theory it means even userid/passwords of customer systems is kept)</li>
<li>one can't be sure that the version of the package is correct (checksum useless) - is the executable part of the package that was tested in the lab the same as that moved into production?</li>
</ul>

<p>A consequence of this approach is that (for Java Web App), in a customer environment, administrators deploy the package, shutdown the app server, copy platform specific configs over the top of those that were imbedded in the package, and restart the app server. Painful.</p>

<p>Perhaps a better approach is to externalise platform specific configuration items - do not have them imbedded in the .war file, and do not have the application reference them in the expanded .war file directory tree. Instead, have configuration items in a ""..\conf"" directory outside the application directory. This has the benefits of:</p>

<ul>
<li>one and only one application package for the executable component of the application</li>
<li>shorter build overhead (compared to above)</li>
<li>no knowledge of ""customer"" platform specific configs (userids/passwords)</li>
<li>auditability (able to do a checksum on an app package, do the same in a lab or on customer platform, and have a high level of confidence that executables are the same) - ""what we tested with is what you have""</li>
<li>deployment is a much shorter process - depending on app server capability, dump the app .war file in the relevant directory and, if no config changes (often the case),
	bounce the app server.</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach does need the application to be able to reference a file outside the application directory. There is a small security consideration on that.  App server environment variables facilitate apps to be able to locate files outside their app directory (or CLASSPATH).</p>

<p>Am looking for the community to vote accordingly.  I can then go back to my work collegues and say ""don't just listen to me, see what the Stackoverflow community reckons.""</p>

<li>It would be easier for my current co-worker to learn Python than my replacement, because my current co-worker will have me sitting next to her (not to make myself out to be anything particularly special – but it's easier to learn something if you've got a teacher with experience)</li>
<li>Some have suggested that my boss is asking a silly question… But the reason I'm asking here is that I've got a lot of respect for him and his business sense (something I, as a programmer, have less of), so I want to take his concerns seriously and give him a good (read: ""reliable and devoid of superstition"") answer.</li>
<li>I don't want to suggest that we'd want to hire the next idiot Java developer… But I believe that there are more ""good"" (read: ""maybe not superstar, but solid and competent"") Java programmers in the world than there are Python programmers.</li>
<li>A few people have suggested that statically typed languages are easier to maintain. I'm willing to believe that, but only if someone can point me to evidence which supports it (I have maintained a large (25k LOC) Python application, and I don't think my task would have been significantly simpler had it been statically typed)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Accepted</h2>

<p>Thanks, everyone, for your responses – they are much appreciated.</p>

<p>After reading through all the answers and linked articles, I have come to these conclusions:</p>

<ul>
<li>When dealing with an established language, the most important factor should be experience (as learning a new toolkit will cost a lot of time, regardless of the language).</li>
<li>Without exception, <em>everyone</em> has said that any competent programmer can pick up Python (or any other sane language) in relatively short order, so we need not worry too much about being hit by a bus.</li>
<li>Assuming equal experience in Java and Python, Python seems to be the favorite choice for all the reasons you would expect: time to market, average programmer quality and syntactic clarity/expressiveness.</li>
<li>Some good arguments have also been made for Java, in that it's got more ""stuff"", especially enterprise ""stuff"", available (Python people: if you can't admit this, you're in denial), there are more experienced (and competent) Java programmers and Java can be faster.</li>
<li>Static typing, however, is not a good reason to consider either language, as for every person who says they think it's helpful there is another (or even two others) saying you're fine without it.</li>
<li>Python (or any language which can run on the JVM) is a good choice, because it leaves the possibility open of interacting with Java code down the road.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, thanks for the responses – they are very much appreciated.</p>

<p>We may now happen to need more JEE facilitites than is provided by Tomcat (we are very tempted by the JEE 6 things in the container) so the question is which Open Source JEE containers works well as Windows services.  Since Glassfish is the only JEE 6 implementation right now, it would be nice if it works well, but I'd like to hear experiences and not just what I can read from brochures.  If not, what else do people use?</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT:  This goes for web containers too, and not just JEE containers.  We will probably keep the necessary stack included until we find the right container and it gets JEE6 support.</p>

They wanted a clean install of the OS and WebSphere, so I did that.  I also took a full file backup of all of the applications they had on the old server.  The problem is that to re-install them on the new server, the WebSphere dialog asks me for the JAR/EAR/WAR file, which I don't have.  </p>

<p>Is there any reasonably easy way to simply extract the backup of the WebSphere application files I have taken from the old maching, and simply configure the new machine to use them?  WAR, etc. is a nice feature to have, but to be forced to use it seems silly.</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> The existing WebSphere server is still up and running in production.</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> The old server is WAS 3.5, which means it doesn't even <em>have</em> an export function, sadly.  Also, the directory where it actually runs the content from has a completely different structure (consisting of like a a %/Web and %/Servlet, where % is the context path of the application).  In the ""Install"" section, it doesn't even mention EAR or WAR, only JAR.  I am currently thinking that perhaps the best thing to do might be to just copy the directory over to another WAS 3.5 system and then upgrade that system (and hope it converts the folder structure and updated the config as part of the upgrade).</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> The closest thing I have found to a solution so far is this link:
<a href=""http://www.javazoom.net/services/newsletter/was4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.javazoom.net/services/newsletter/was4.html</a> (though I am not sure if that tool is available or relevant for WAS 7.x).</p>

<p>At times, it so pisses me off that I start cursing IBM for building an operating system! instead of an app server: Spawning 20+ processes and useless services with no documented configuration to tuning it, to starting any faster. </p>

<p>I am sure there are many java developers out there, who would agree with me on this. Now, I tried to disable the default apps and a set of services via my admin console, however, that hasn't helped much.</p>

<p>I have no webservices, no enterprise beans, no queues, just a simple web app which requires a connection pool. Have you done something in the past to make your integrated test environment, start fast in debug mode and there by consume less RAM? </p>

<p>UPDATE: 
I tried disabling a few services (internationaliztion, default apps etc...) and now the websphere server went from bad to worse. Not only doesn't it take horrifying startup time, it keeps freezing every now and then for upto 2 minutes. :-( Sounds like, optimization is not such a good thing, always!</p>

<p>The Sun JVM has a distinct advantage with the jvisualvm program, which allows runtime inspection of running code.  Is there any technical advantages of any other JVM that might make it a better choice for development and/or production? </p>

<p>In other words, is there a killer facility or scenario that would make any investment of time/effort/money worth it in another JVM? </p>

<p>(Please also suggest additional JVM's if they would be a good choice).</p>

By some reason it appears, that I have duplicate jars on the class paths of two classloaders (2 different EAR classloaders), and the classes from namespaces of these class loaders need to colaborate.</p>

<p>So the question is following: does exist any tool which can show an image (picture) of class loader tree together with the repository of each class loader?

Utility classes (with private CTORs so they can't be instantiated) as holders for static methods we already do.  My question here was more in line of these little methods that HELP OUT the main class API.</p>

<p>I might have 4 or 5 main API/instance methods on a class that do the real work, but in the course of doing so they share some common functionality that might only be working on the input parameters to the API method, and not internal state.  THESE are the code sections I typically pull out into their own helper methods, and if they don't need to access the class' state, make them static.</p>

<p>My question was thus, is this inherently a bad idea, and if so, why? (Or why not?)</p>

<p>So, I then tried to do it via RMI, but adding in the sas.client.properties to the environment, and setting the connectort type in the code to CONNECTOR_TYPE_RMI.  Now though I got a NameNotFoundException out of CORBA:</p>

<pre><code>Caused by: javax.naming.NameNotFoundException: Context: , name: JMXConnector: First component in name JMXConnector not found. [Root exception is org.omg.CosNaming.NamingContextPackage.NotFound: IDL:omg.org/CosNaming/NamingContext/NotFound:1.0]
</code></pre>

<p>To see if it was an IBM issue, I tried using the standard JMX connector as well with the same result (substitute AdminClient for JMXConnector in the above error)</p>

<pre><code>        JMXServiceURL url = new JMXServiceURL(""service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/JMXConnector"");
        Hashtable h = new Hashtable();
        String providerUrl = ""corbaloc:iiop:"" + dmgrHost + "":"" + rmiPort + ""/WsnAdminNameService"";
        h.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, providerUrl);

        // Specify the user ID and password for the server if security is enabled on server.
        String[] credentials = new String[] { ""***"", ""***"" };
        h.put(""jmx.remote.credentials"", credentials);

        // Establish the JMX connection.
        JMXConnector jmxc = JMXConnectorFactory.connect(url, h);

        // Get the MBean server connection instance.
        mbsc = jmxc.getMBeanServerConnection();
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, in desperation I wrote a wsadmin sccript to run both the RMI and SOAP methods.  To my amazement, this works fine.  So my question is, why does the code not work in a servlet installed on the dmgr ?</p>

I don't know if there's a topology that describes this, but this is the model I'm going after:</p>

<p><strong>EXAMPLE MODEL A</strong></p>

<p>A) There are two running message brokers (ideally all on localhost if possible, for easier demo-ing) :</p>

<ul>
<li>Broker-A</li>
<li>Broker-B</li>
</ul>

<p>B) Each broker will have 2 listeners and 1 publisher.</p>

  <p>[subscriber A1, subscriber A2, publisher A1] &lt;--> BrokerA &lt;-->
  BrokerB &lt;--> 
  [publisher B1, subscriber
  B1, subscriber B2]</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>IF a message-X is published to broker A and there no subscribers for it among the listeners on Broker-B (via
  criteria in Message Selectors or Broker routing rules), then that message-X will never be published to Broker-B.</p></li>
  <li><p>ELSE, broker A will publish the message to broker B, where one of the
  broker B
  listeners/subscribers/services is
  expecting that message based on the
  subscription criteria.</p></li>

<p><strong>Is Clustering the Correct Approach?</strong></p>

<p>At first, I concluded that the ""Broker Clustering"" concept is what I needed to support this.  However, as I have come to understand it, the typical use of clustering entails either:</p>

<ul>
<li>message redundancy across all brokers ... or </li>
<li>Competing Consumers pattern</li>
</ul>

<p>... and neither of these satisfy the requirement in the EXAMPLE MODEL A.</p>

<p><strong>What is the Correct Approach?</strong></p>

<p>My question is, does anyone know of a JMS implementation that supports the model I described?  </p>

<p>I scanned through all the stackoverflow post titles for the search: JMS and Cluster.  I found these two informative, but seemingly conflicting posts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Says the EXAMPLE MODEL A is/should-be implicitly supported:
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2255816/jms-consumer-with-activemq-network-of-brokers"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2255816/jms-consumer-with-activemq-network-of-brokers</a>
"" this means you pick a broker, connect to it, and let the broker network sort it out amongst themselves. In theory.""</p></li>
<li><p>Says the EXAMPLE MODEL A IS NOT suported:
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2017520/how-does-a-jms-topic-subscriber-in-a-clustered-application-server-recieve-message"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2017520/how-does-a-jms-topic-subscriber-in-a-clustered-application-server-recieve-message</a>

<p>Not sure what it means, I have enabled JSF1.2 as project facet in the RAD but still keep getting the above error message and none of my jsf files are working.</p>

<p>After following BalusC's comment, I see the following directories are lookup by the code (this is the o/p of url.getPath())</p>

<p>There is no jsf impl in among these directories. Now I am more confused as the original lib should be present under c:\IBM\SDP\runtimes\base_v7\plugins !!</p>

<p>Essentially, I have two EJB enterprise applications, that need to communicate with one another. The first is a web application, the second is a search server - they are located on different development servers, not in the same node, cell, or JVM, although they are on the same physical box.</p>

<p>I'm doing the JNDI lookup via IIOP, and the URL I am using is as follows:</p>

<p>iiop://searchserver:2819</p>

<p>In my hosts file, I've set searchserver to 127.0.0.1. The ports for my search server are bound to this hostname too. </p>

<p>However, when the web app (that uses Spring btw) attempts to lookup the search EJB, it fails with the following error. This is driving me nuts, surely this kind of comms between the servers should be fairly simple to get working. I've checked the ports and they are correct. </p>

<p>I note that the exception says the initial context is H00723Node03Cell/nodes/H00723Node03/servers/server1, name: ejb/com/hmv/dataaccess/ejb/hmvsearch/HMVSearchHome.  This is the web apps server NOT the search server. Is this correct?  How can I get Spring to use the right context?</p>

This data will be produced at regular intervals and sent to the server as xml in an http post. The devices will keep resending the same data if they don't receive a specific acknowledgment from the server. Some potentially heavy duty processing of this data will need to occur before it's inserted to a number of tables in the main database via a transaction, and additionally some data points will need to be enqueued to be re-directed to other external urls.</p>

<p>I'm planning on using a Java application server (leaning towards GlassFish) with a servlet to receive the incoming data. I'd like to implement some kind of queuing mechanism to store the data temporarily so that the response back to the sensor isn't dependent on all the intermediate processing. Separate independent queues are also a requirement for the data re-direction piece. After doing some research the two main options seem to be:</p>

<p>1) Install a database on the app server and use tables for the various queues. The queues would be processed by a Java application, either running in the app server or standalone as it's own service.</p>

<p>2) Use a database backed JMS solution to implement the queuing.</p>

<p>I'm not that familiar with JMS but from what I've read it seems to be the better solution in this case. The primary requirement is that no sensor data ever be lost or dropped from the queue before being processed and that it be processed more or less sequentially. We'd also like to make it easy to halt the processing of some of the queues at certain times but still have them accumulate data and for these messages to never automatically expire.</p>

<p>With strategy 1 it's obvious to me how to meet these requirements but it may be less robust and scalable, and more complex to develop than strategy 2, since I'll need to write my own multi-threaded code to handle the various independent queues. I'm wondering what the potential pitfalls could be in using JMS queues for this purpose since I've never worked with them before. </p>

<p>Data integrity is a big issue so I need to make sure JMS can guarantee no data loss in the event of a server reboot, power outage, or if the queue gets very large for some reason. For instance could a problem completing transactions to the main database for a period of time potentially cause the JVM to run out of memory, crash, and lose all accumulated data? (This would be the nightmare scenario). </p>

<p>Also, I was wondering if there would be any way to pause the JMS queue processing via an app server admin tool or to easily see what's in the queue (I would be enqueuing an object which would be the message xml plus some other data, including timestamp received, etc.) I've read a few posts on here that deal with related issues but wanted to get some direct feedback. Basically I'd like to know of instances (if any) where JMS is not an appropriate queuing solution and if this is one of those cases. Any advice is greatly appreciated.</p>

In .Net i created class library and got things done. I never felt the need for anything like EJB. Simple classes were enough. Then, why in Java people stress on EJB?

<p>I have the previous code in an standalone application that is connecting to WAS 6.1.0.3 in order to retrieve a connection from the datasource. The code is very straighforward, and I have seen the same code working in a different environment, but in this case when I call getConnection I get an exception. The datasource is WAS has the proper authentication alias set and when the connection is tested it works OK from the WAS side, but the previous code won't work.</p>

<p>If I change this line: <strong>conn = ds.getConnection();</strong></p>

<p>to this: <strong>conn = ds.getConnection(""username"",""password"");</strong></p>

<p>Then the code will work! But that's not what I want since the connections in the datasource should already have the credentials set. I was initially thinking this was a Sybase problem, but it's also happening with Oracle, so would rather say I have a problem with WAS.</p>

Should we keep both ( RAD and maven ) settings in the project workspace or remove all RAD settings and stick with Maven only?</p>

<p>Also , I am wondering about m2eclipse dependency management feature. I was hoping that it will update pom.xml with the new dependency when I add it to the classpath and vise versa ( in case we are keeping both configurations ). Is this a correct assumption?

<p>I am thinking I can store this file in the EAR root, reference it in the manifest and then load and save it. </p>

<p>I have tried this approach by having my file in a JAR and making this available via the MANIFES and I can load the config file from the class path no problem using the following. </p>

<pre><code>this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(""configFileName"");

<p>That loads the file that is in the JAR, which is fantastic.  But if I want to edit this file, programmatically, I cannot access the JAR files location (the EAR root) it returns me an interpreted path like this:</p>

<p>There are 3 groups of users on the same network. There is a J2EE application that is set to end a user's session after 60 minutes. The groups are A, B and C. Now Group A, B and C all log into the J2EE application and start using it. Group A users can use the application just fine with no issues.  Group B and C though are kicked out are various times, but all before the set time of 60 minutes.  Now a user from Group A goes to a Group B's PC. The Group B user logs into their PC with their AD credentials and then the Group A user logs into the J2EE application. After some time, well before the 60 minute session time, the Group A users' session is ended prematurely.</p>

<p>Still with me? I hope so.</p>

<p>Now the Group B user, goes to a Group A users' PC and does the same as above. The Group A user logs into their PC with their AD credentials and the Group B user logs into the J2EE application. The Group B user has no timeout issues and doesn't get kicked out before the 60 minute set time for the session to end.</p>

<p>Whew!  So it doesn't look like the J2EE application is terminating the users' session, because the Group B users is fine when logged into a Group A users PC.</p>

<p>Now, would someone be able to explain how this could occur? I was thinking that the Application Server (Websphere App Server 6.1) might be configured to do such a thing, but I'm not a websphere administrator.</p>

<p>Any ideas or suggestions of what I may try to solve this issue would be greatly appreciated. Also, please ask any questions as I know that there may be some things that I have left out in my explanation of what is going on.</p>

The client is currently a Java desktop rich client which must receive updates from other connected clients. The server is GlassFish 3.01. I had a basic, blocking @WebMethod but I had problems resulting from its use. Here's some pseudo-code showing the idea of the web method:</p>

<pre><code>@WebService(serviceName=""mywebservice"")
@Stateless
public class MyWebService {
    @WebMethod
    public String longPoll() {
         short ct = 0;
         while(someCondition == false &amp;&amp; ct &lt; 60) {
             sleep(1000);  // 1 sec
             ct++;
         }
         if (someCondition)
             return ""got value"";
         else
             return """";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And on the client-side, I am calling this asynchronously, using the Future object:</p>

<pre><code>public Future&lt;?&gt; requestLongPollAsync(Date lastUpdate, 
            AsyncHandler&lt;LongPollResponse&gt; handler) {
    try {
        return mywebservice.longPollAsync(getXMLGregorianCalendar(lastUpdate), 
            handler);
    } 
    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The client side seems to work okay. However, I have 2 problems that arose from this, seemingly due to the long lasting nature of the web service call:</p>

<ol>
<li>Each requester uses an active http listener, so this is not scalable,</li>
<li>When the client disconnects, GlassFish throws an exception (SSL exception, as all calls must go through the secure SSL listener (by default, http-listener-2)).</li>
</ol>

<p>Do I need to use com.sun.grizzly.comet.CometEngine? Does the EJB 3.1 @Asynchronous annotation do anything here? All examples I've found rely on the Servlet API, AJAX, and other technologies which are not applicable. Thank you.</p>

<p>Here's the hypothetical scenario... There's a <em>.war</em> file that has the following (partial) directory structure:</p>

<pre><code> WEB-INF/classes/com/acme/Bunny.class
 .
 .
 .
 WEB-INF/lib/acme.jar
</code></pre>

<p>Both <em>Bunny.class</em> files have import referencing other classes from <em>acme.jar</em></p>

<p><em>Bunny.class</em> in <em>WEB-INF/classes/...</em> is the only class that has the same name/path that a class from <em>acme.jar</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>.jar</em> file <em>acme.jar</em> also contains <em>com.acme.Bunny</em> (and there are a no special class loader tricks used).</p>

<p>I understand that the Java spec guarantees that a class won't be loaded until it is actually used (or ""manually class-loaded"" on purpose) by the program, which is why if you stuff thousands of .jar, say, in a .war, the classloader(s) don't start classloading tens of thousands of classes.</p>

<p><em>(edit)</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But what about the order in which the
  two classes in the examples above are
  loaded?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>should have been phrased:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But how is it decided which one of the
  two classes above is loaded?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or something like that :)</p>

<p>There's one guarantee made: <em>com.acme.Bunny</em> shall be used before any other class from <em>com.acme...</em>.</p>

<p>Basically, on Wikipedia, the following is written:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most complex JAR hell problems
  arise in circumstances that take
  advantage of the full complexity of
  the classloading system. A Java
  program is not required to use only a
  single ""flat"" classloader, but instead
  may be composed of several (or, in
  fact, an indefinite number of) nested,
  cooperating classloaders. Classes
  loaded by different classloaders may
  interact in complex ways not fully
  comprehended by a developer, leading
  to inexplicable errors or bugs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I'm wondering: can I be sure that <em>/classes/com/acme/Bunny.class</em> will be classloaded before the one from <em>.jar</em> inside the <em>WEB-INF/lib/</em> dir or not?</p>

<p>Automatic tools do something similar, i.e. parse a WSDL and from the types section create for example JAXB classes that can be instances of the elements defined in schema.<br>
Is there any library to do this?  </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong><br>
For example in Eclipse when creating an xml descriptor for a web application it presents a tree table with all the required elements for the users to fill in according to schema. How do they do it? I imagine they parse the xsds included in the jars<br>

Somewhere in another 7-10 days the figure drops well below 100mb (which we deem dangerous and we start to recycle the JVM).  If we don't do the recycle, the JVM will eventually crash with a SIGSEGV signal.</p>

<p>We've done some initial investigation into class counts and the size of JIT code.  Class counts grow, but slowly from 50k onwards...about a couple hundred per day.  JITC sizes get to about 210 MB after 7 days and grow about 1 MB per day after that so.  In our previous experience we don't find these to be sinister values.</p>

<p>What we need to to be able to break down what is in the native heap, whether it is threads (all thread counts appear normal and we have fixed thread pools), String pools, constant pools, bytecode, or whatever else.</p>

<p>One lead we are trying now is reducing the reflection threshold to 0 (shutting off the bytecode accessors for reflectively created classes).  This app uses a lot of pointcutting and a lot of reflection, so we're hoping there's a good chance this helps.</p>

Most of J2EE applications are using container managed datasources through JNDI. This is fine as it gives one place for configuring these connections.<br>
The problem arises when we want to use ORM framework (like hibernate) or something that have to know the default schema (mostly for Oracle, may be others too), which can be different from the username that is used to connect to the DB.</p>

<p>I want to put the default schema name somewhere close to the datasource definition. One of the options would be to put it in JNDI. I will then manually read of from there before construction the EntityManager (well actually using Spring).</p>

<p>As I found out there is a simple way to specify custom resource (in this situation it will be String with default schema name) in Apache Tomcat like this (correct me if I'm wrong):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Environment name=""schemaNames/EmployeeDB""
             type=""java.lang.String""
            value=""empl""
      description=""Schema name of Employees Database for HR Applications""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Anyway, considering this can be done in Apache Tomcat, how should I configure the same custom JNDI resource (of String type) within other application servers:</p>

<ul>
<li>JBoss 4/5</li>
<li>WebSphere 6/7</li>
<li>WebLogic 9/10</li>
</ul>

<p>If you know about other servers that would be great too.</p>

<p>Also, as an alternative I don't want to put the schema name in system properties or environment variables.</p>

<p>Thank you very much !</p>

<p>How could I get these directly from IBM?  My company has a support contract for Websphere, and I hopefully could have one of our Websphere engineers download it if I can tell them where to go.</p>

<p>If there's no direct download, what are some good free products with IBM JDKs that I could scavenge an old version like this from?</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it because Eclipse is the alpha
version of WebSphere (similar to how
Fedora is the alpha for RHEL)?</li>
<li>Is it because Android plugins and

<p>Update (1): Observing the down-votes, it is amusing to see how people prefer to 'click' instead of providing useful answers in the links above. Actually, it is not amusing, it is sad.</p>

<p>Update (2): I truly appreciate Paul McMillan's answer which was the most concrete and to-the-point. However, it was edited by someone else to include spin-doctoring like ""Fedora isn't the alpha for RHEL either - it's just more bleeding edge"" so I had to accept the next best answer.</p>

<p>Update (3): I can't believe that there are professionals who suggest working (on a daily basis, <em>not</em> for administration purposes) from an Admin account. I can understand lay home users doing so, but computer professionals?</p>

<p>Update (4): I managed to find a workaround for the problem described in case #2 (see link above). This took time that was intended for getting up and running with actual Android programming.</p>

<p>Update (5): I resorted to installing the same 64-bit development environment (Android 2.3) under Ubuntu 10.04 64-bit. Not a single hassle. And it's FAST. What a pleasure.</p>

<p><strong>Update (6)</strong>: I finally nailed down the source of this great ordeal. It turned out to be the <a href=""http://forums.comodo.com/firewall-help-cis/cis-firewall-blocking-android-sdk-t66863.0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Comodo Firewal</a>l (aka <a href=""http://forums.comodo.com/firewall-help-cis/cis-firewall-blocking-android-sdk-t66863.0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">CIS</a>).</p>

HTML and front end performance isn't their specialty and things get implemented poorly because of the situation. The whole situation is extremely inefficient so I'm working up a proposal to implement a templating engine on our platform so that we can fix this situation and everyone can work in their respective wheelhouses. I've seen some suggestions for Java based templating engines such as StringTemplate or FreeMarker. Knowing little of Java application development and the Websphere Commerce framework can any Java based templating engine work with Websphere Commerce? If not are there any recommendations on Websphere Commerce specific templating engines?</p>

Just like there are (external) domain-specific programming languages (where instead of the int's and string's and classes you have business-specific entities and functions that are the primitive types in the language syntax/semantics), is there such a thing as a domain-specific enterprise service bus where instead of routing, orchestrating, and integrating different systems through standard protocols (SOAP/HTTP, JMS, JDBC...etc), you're actually working at more abstract layer of integrating commercial systems (in a specific industry) via their communication protocols? I'm wondering if this pattern has been used as a product for integrating different systems (of different domain standards) within a specific industry (e.g. healthcare, automotive). </p>

<p>Example, in healthcare. You have a central bus that commercial healthcare applications plug into and communicate to each other, get orchestrated, monitored through protocols like HL7, HIE, CCD...etc where the activities, integration, and workflows done through the bus are authored by business analysts (instead of IT staff), example: health quality officers at a hospital, clinical analysts, physicians....etc</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> I am trying to create a JAX-WS client to call into the Human Task Manager and Business Flow Manager services in WebSphere Process Server V7, that are exposed via JAX-WS. By default they have attached Policy sets, and provider bindings that specify some WS-Security settings (as these are not defined in the WSDL).</p>

<p>I have figured out how to make it work using a Dynamic Web Project. I have been able to generate the JAX-WS client code from the WSDL. I have been able to export the policy sets and provider and client bindings from Process Server and import them into my workspace. I have been able to attach the policy set and client bindings to the client service. I have been able to set up a page and a servlet to invoke my web service (to test the client). And I have been able to set up the security settings in the deployment descriptors and websphere binding/extension files to get it work.</p>

<p>This is all wonderful, but in reality we don't want an ear with a war just to expose the web service client to our other applications we are writing. We want to generate a web service client jar and package it with other applications.</p>

<p>Given this line of thought I have been able to figure out how to use a regular Java Project in my IDE and generate the web service client into it. I have also been able to attach the policy set and client bindings to the client.</p>

<p><strong>My problem</strong> is now how to I invoke this?  I have created a dynamic web project with my page and servlet as before to test my client. I set up my client project as a web library dependency so it has access to the client code. I can even set up the deployment descriptors as before to force login and authenication. Only problem now is that I can't figure out how to pass the credentials to my web service now that it is in its own ""jar"". Before I had access to a menu to set up the TokenGenerator and CallbackHandler. Now, I don't have access to those menus as the client is not in the dynamic web project. So now I have a ""disconnect"" and it of course fails when trying to run it on the server.</p>

<p>There has to be a way to do this. I should be able to generate a client jar and pass it what it needs. Anyone encounter this before?</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>I have an application that is currently running out of JBossAS and I'm trying to get it to run in WebSphere. The only issue I'm currently having is getting the correct JTA Transaction Manager injected with the proper settings.</p>

<p>Here's the old setting</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id=""transactionManager""
    class=""org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager""&gt;

    &lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name=""allowCustomIsolationLevels"" value=""true"" /&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This worked since JBossAS has it's JTA Transaction Manager defined at JNDI location  <em>java:/TransactionManager</em>. However, WebSphere does not have the same JNDI location.</p>

<p>Spring 2.5.x provides a way to get the JTA Transaction Manager in a generalized way.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tx:jta-transaction-manager /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This gets the <em>JtaTransactionManager</em> object and defines it as a bean with the id <em>transactionManager</em>.</p>

<p>I looked in the <a href=""http://www.springframework.org/schema/tx/spring-tx-2.5.xsd"" rel=""nofollow"">Spring TX schema</a>, but the only setting available is to set a specific isolation level, but not just to allow custom levels to be used (as defined elsewhere). <strong>How do I set the <em>allowCustomIsolationLevels</em> property using the <em>tx:jta-transaction-manager</em> tag?</strong></p>

It's using Java 1.4 and XFire to produce code-first web services (I know, I know, best practices...).  Anyways, the heads have recently decided <em>everyone</em> needs Websphere 7 now!</p>

<p>Upgrading to Websphere 7 changed the WSDL significantly.  For example, before, if this was the order (probably not valid XML but I think you'll catch my meaning)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsd:sequence&gt;
    &lt;xsd:element type=""xsd:date"" name=""blah"" /&gt;
    &lt;xsd:element type=""xsd:string"" name=""blah2"" /&gt;
&lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The new order is this in places, which breaks the older devices which attempt to use the (functional) service:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsd:sequence&gt;
    &lt;xsd:element type=""xsd:string"" name=""blah2"" /&gt;
    &lt;xsd:element type=""xsd:date"" name=""blah"" /&gt;
&lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I've suggested that they take their old WSDLs and use XFire to just use the static (i.e. not code-generated) WSDLs to deploy it for a fix.</p>

<p>But is there some way to get Websphere 7 to <em>not</em> automatically change the order?  Is it even Websphere 7's fault (maybe XFire?)</p>

<p>I've been thinking for some time now about the intricacies of message-based architectures when one of the channels for messages to pass along includes the internet.</p>

<p>I'm fine with the concept of queuing messages up on clients that, when processed, result in web-service calls over the internet that then queue those same messages on the server to be processed against business rules. What I don't currently know of is a mechanism of sending messages <strong>back</strong> to the client to tell it that something happened.</p>

<h2>The Example</h2>

<p>Consider for this example a desktop warehouse management application that wishes to receive messages from a server, rather than polling to see if there are any.</p>

<p>E.g.</p>

<ol>
<li>User creates urgent order on website with tight SLA for picking within a few minutes, because someone is already on their way to collect the item.</li>
<li><code>OrderCreated</code> message is published on the server.</li>
<li><strong>Magic happens to send the <code>OrderCreated</code> message to the client software running on a PC in a warehouse.</strong></li>
<li>The client software displays the new order on the screen (and perhaps caches to disk in case of restarts etc).</li>
<li>Warehouse team pick the items to fulfill the order.</li>
</ol>

<p>It's point 3 above that I'm looking for technologies to fill the gap.</p>

<h2>Some Possible Solutions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Polling the server regularly and often (sub-minute) to see if there are messages, and download them to a local queue for processing.</li>
<li>Use something like two-way comms in WCF, though this requires channels/sockets/ports etc are kept permanently open between clients and server, so it won't scale elegantly.</li>
<li>Actually open up ports and configure port forwarding and firewalls etc in local sites to enable MSMQ (or some other tech like WCF, which could mean hosting IIS or similar on client hardware) to push messages to clients. Of course the deployment and support costs here are astronomical.</li>
</ol>

<p>Does anyone have any experience of achieving this with a solution I've not listed here? I'm not looking for details necessarily, I'm just poking around in this space to see how it might be done.</p>

This jar, called common.jar for the sake of example has vendor jar files in it as well as other xml files that the EJB depends on and will need to be able to see during runtime....</p>

<p>So far I have everything packaged correctly as an EAR like this:</p>

<pre><code>EARFILE.ear
 -EJBFILE.jar
   /META-INF
     -MANIFEST.MF
 -common.jar
   /META-INF
     -MANIFEST.MF
   /lib
     -(all vendor jars inside here)
   -(All the xml config files are inside the root of the common.jar)

<p>Inside the MANIFEST.MF for the <strong>EJBFILE.jar</strong> is...</p>

<pre><code>Class-path: ../../common.jar
</code></pre>

<p>Inside the MANIFEST.MF for the <strong>common.jar</strong> is...</p>

<pre><code>Class-path: ../lib/some_common.jar

<p>When I deploy this the appserver (websphere) cannot find the JAR file when I try to start the server. I am getting the <code>ClassDefNotFoundError</code> because the classes inside the EJB cant find the vendor JAR files when I try to start the instance. However I know that common.jar is setup correctly though, else the EJB wouldn't have compiled since it needed to have those vendor jars on the classpath for javac.</p>

<p>So what I want to know is this:</p>

<ol>
<li>How can I get the runtime to correctly see the Vendor jar files.</li>
<li>Will the EJB be able to see the xml files at run-time? I am concerned about this because these xml files are located outside of the EJB inside of a jar that is just in the EAR, it isn't even a module its just a jar inside the EAR. </li>
<li>Does it even matter when using websphere? From what I gather some containers don't even care what is in the Class-path of MANIFEST.MF.</li>

I feel like in today's age we have a million and one ways to implement services tat are cross-platform (SOAP) and easy to build (thanks to .NET, java, and other frameworks).  However, these technologies have been in the community for 5-10 years, but we are (or at least I am) constantly plagued with the same issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>Identification (Tracking services) - UDDI; e.g., had to remind a co-worker the 3 times this month where a service is at, despite the fact there is a wiki that discusses the service and a PDF version of the same documentation that lives in a repository where we keep our service docs.</li>
<li>Scalability - Out of the box clustering; As organizations, we spend a lot of money on paying our admins just to watch the utilization of our services and make decisions like, does this service need more RAM, more CPU, more interfaces?  How do I load balance this?</li>
<li>Monitoring - error logging, etc; I can't count how many times I have to set up tracing on services in order to see why a bug is happening that only seems to affect one customer, or have to code logic into the service to serialize exceptions, log exceptions to dbs, fail gracefully, etc.</li>
<li>Deployment - easy to deploy; none of this deploying DLLs to 5 load balanced servers</li>
</ol>

<p>Each one of these problems requires some type of custom solution implemented by the organization.  Documentation and UDDIs for #1.  Virtualization and load balancing hardware / software for #2.  Tracing, writing exceptions to databases / logs, etc for #3.  Custom deployment software for #4.  I work for a mid-sized organization.  I can't even imagine how a company the size of Sun, Google, or Microsoft would tackle these dilemmas.</p>

<p>Maybe my vision is unrealistic, but I dream of having a Framework per se that lives on top of a server cluster that manages all of the above.  I was ecstatic to read about Microsoft's AppFabric since it really seems to extend some of the functionality of BizTalk to WCF service implementors: Caching, Hosting, Monitoring, etc.  However, from what I've seen, I still don't feel it lives up to my dream for an all-in-one solution that assists the developer and organization in writing services that are scaled across clusters easily, deployed into the cluster easily, and identifiable, possibly even version-able. </p>

<p>So, I don't mean this post to be about my dream.  I do actually have a question.  For starters, is my dream / want completely unrealistic?  Furthermore, what solutions are there available that attempt to solve these problems without confining us to a new and more proprietary way (BizTalk) of developing services?  An lastly, in concern to a complete SOA / ESB solution, where do we see the most potential in the market right now or in the future?</p>

After that I tried to improve this client by adding the RMS policy on the word document by invoking the method ""<strong>ApplyPolicy</strong>"" passing the path of RMS XML template file. I tried this client and it's working correctly.<br>
After that I improved that client and converted it to a Web-Project and tried to deploy it on Websphere 6.1 (after i configured the JACOB library with websphere by putting the JACOB dll inside the /bin directory for websphere itself). But before that I removed the ""ApplyPolicy"" invocation and tried it, and it worked correctly, the MS word file opened and the text-replaced and the result file is saved correctly. After that I restored the invocation of ""ApplyPolicy"" and tried it, but the server hanged, and the page was still loading, I checked the process using TASK manager, I found that   there were a process WINWORD.exe, and when I tried to kill it, the server returned back and printed error in it's log (<strong>A COM exception has been encountered: At Invoke of: ApplyPolicy Description: The remote procedure call failed.</strong>).<br>
After investigating I found that when I run the stand-alone java application and opened the task manager, there was a java.exe *32 process and winword.exe *32 process, but when I converted it to a web application and run it from inside the websphere and checked the task manager there was already a process java.exe *32 (started at the server started up) and when I called my page, a winword.exe (without 32) process created and hanged and as a result the server hanged also.

<p>Play looks very polished.  The Scala-specific tutorial looks amazing.  Furthermore, since I've been coding in MVC frameworks for a long time, it looks super familiar.  However, it doesn't look like it can easily accomplish all the brilliant things that Lift can do.  For instance, I can't find anywhere where it mentions Comet or Jetty Continuations.  Furthermore, I kind of like the ""View First"" methodology in Lift because instead of using one controller, it lets me use a ton of snippets to piece together a page.</p>

<p>Lift looks brilliant, but leaves me with a lot of questions unanswered.  Being highly stateful looks like it opens up a lot of possibilities, but I wonder how it'll turn out in practice.  The book on Lift is a bit of a mess, and so is the wiki.  The ""Getting Started"" page is badly formatted and is no match for Play's tutorial.</p>

<p>Does Play support Jetty Continuations?</p>

<p>Is it painful to get started with Lift doing normal web application development?</p>

<p>How does Lift's statefulness work out in practice?  How do you cope with web servers going down in Lift?  If I'm using Lift, and I push a new version of my code on a daily basis, does that mean I have to restart the application, and does that mean everyone's session gets wiped out?</p>

<p>Does Lift's statefulness actually make it easier to code?</p>

<p>What happens if someone messes around with the back button in Lift?  What happens if a user is bouncing back and forth between several tabs?</p>

<p>As per requirements I need to build a user experience to be like a synchronous on-line transaction for a web service call, which actually delegates the call to a IBM MQ Series using an asynchronous JMS-MQ Bridge. </p>

<p>The client calls the web service and than his message should be published in a JMS queue on the App server which will be delivered to WebSphere MQ and than after processing a response will delivered back to App server in a FIXED JMS queue endpoint. </p>

<p>The requirement deals with this transaction that will need to time out in case WebSphere MQ does not delivery the response in a defined amount of time, than the web service should send a time-out signal to client and ignore this transaction.</p>

<p>I need to block the request on the web service until the response arrives or time-out.</p>

Maybe I could implement some block with a listener to be notified when the response arrives? </p>

<p>If you need some background information: the app is a web service, and each request message that it receives results in the creation of 100 or 200 audit log messages which must be persisted to a database.  Originally the audit logging was done with a custom audit handler class that extends java.util.logging.Handler, and the publish method would open a database connection, populate a prepared statement from the LogRecord, and execute the insert.  Since this custom Handler was running within the EJB's thread, audit logging could add up to several seconds to the response time for each request message and was causing SLAs to be missed.</p>

<p>So the audit handler was replaced with a wrapper handler that adds creates a separate thread (<em>yes, with new Thread(), against the rules of Java EE</em>).  The wrapper handler uses a Vector to queue the audit records, and it persists them as fast as possible in the separate thread using the audit handler.</p>

<p>While it breaks the rules of JEE threading, this wrapper has worked quite well... <strong>until we allowed concurrent invocations on the MDB.</strong>  The wrapper has the potential to screw up when multiple EJB invocations are allowed, and potentially will save each log record to the database multiple times.  This seems to indicate that the wrapper or thread creation logic has a bug.</p>

<p>I was going to work on identifying and fixing that problem, but thought I'd first ask SO if there's a better way.</p>

What I find from looking at the log is as soon as my request processor returns, the background processing thread also seems to exit as it is not giving any log messages.

Doesn't the request processor thread which is started by websphere remain alive in the pool of threads for ever? In that case shouldn't my background thread keep on working?

<p>Here's the situation:</p>

<p>1) IBM RAD has the ability to deploy a Portlet directly from within itself (RUN/DEBUG)</p>

<p>In this case, I'm not using Maven generated WAR at all because IBM RAD seems to create the WAR themselves automagically and push it to IBM WebSphere Portal. Which isn't a big deal so far.</p>

<p>2) Maven dependencies are not copied to WebContent/WEB-INF/lib directory</p>

<p>IBM has its own directory structure: WebContent/WEB-INF and WebContent/META-INF. If I updated pom.xml to include new dependencies, those JARS will not be copied to the WebContent/WEB-INF/lib directory hence when I wanted to RUN/DEBUG the portlet, those libraries will not be included.</p>

<p>Question:</p>

<p>Is there a way to copy the new JARs automatically to the WebContent/WEB-INF/lib folder as soon as I update the pom.xml? (if so, which lifecycle this should be in?)</p>

<p>If there's no perfect solution for question #1, I don't mind if this step is included in the ""mvn install"" compile/goal. </p>

<p>Prefer not to use ant-task but instead maven own copy utility if exist. </p>

<p>If anyone has suggestions how to integrate Maven and IBM RAD for WebSphere Portlet development, feel free to add more answers.</p>

System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword"",""password"");

    kmf.init( ks, ""f0p6k9n2"".toCharArray() );

    TrustManagerFactory tmf = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance( ""SunX509"" );
    tmf.init( jks );

    SSLContext ctx = SSLContext.getInstance( ""TLS"" );
    ctx.init( kmf.getKeyManagers(), tmf.getTrustManagers(), null );

<p>Also, as I thought that may be the problem was the web service, I tried to stablish an HTTPS connection, and it fails with the same error when openning an input stream.</p>

<pre><code>   String httpsURL = ""https://serverurl:443/theservice?wsdl"";

    &lt;param-value&gt;UTF-8&lt;/param-value&gt; 
&lt;/context-param&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>We have logged what is the value
passed as an argument to the
<code>setName</code> method, for if it could be
an error at writing the response. The
value passed is already wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>We have tried to write a web Filter,
to set the request charset to UTF-8 (just in
case, you know). But when logging the
parameter values at the filter, we
got the wrong value too.</p></li>
<li><p>At last we removed the

<p>I've seen the following story play out enough times now, that I have to ask:  is there a better way?</p>

<p>This story is when one team sets up their SOA-flavored service;  other teams start calling it, or accidentally hammer it.  Service falls over.  And a negotiation ensues as to whether the caller should call less, or the callee should beef up their capacity to support the call volume.</p>

<p>It's a very manual, piecemeal negotiation.  </p>

<p>Is there any literature out there on different approaches?  One idea off the top of my head:  a service owner would require ""caller credits"" (think currency, or permission slips) on the part of each caller.  These credits would be issued by the service itself (or some adjunct ServieCallAdministrationService.  Yeah, horrible name).  In that manner, the service owner can better guarantee service quality by limiting their service volume?</p>

<p>Put another way:  who should ""own"" this problem of managing overall service call volume?  The service itself?  Callers?  Something else?</p>

That turned out to be WAY too slow.  They have brought me in to ""quickly"" fix it.  I plan to convert all the web service calls to plain JDBC.  To do that, I need to get a JDBC connection from the pool and then use it in multiple different methods.  I need to use the same JDBC connection in multiple DAOs to string it all together into a single database transaction.  I can explicitly pass around the JDBC connection to each DAO that needs it, but that would require me to change a LOT of method signatures, plus a LOT of unit tests (which goes against the ""quickly"" part).  </p>

<p>I am trying to come up with a good way put the JDBC connection somewhere and then just grab it in the methods that need it without having to explicitly pass it around everywhere.  We can't use Spring, JPA, or Hibernate on this project because the support team won't support those technologies.  I can put the JDBC connection into an EJB, but I am not sure how reliable that would be.  I could create a custom Singleton to manage database connections for each user (session?), but I would have to be careful about thread safety.

System.Threading.Monitor.Exit(locker)
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>I heard that Q.Get(message, getMessageOptions) makes the message unavailable for other readers, QManager.Commit in turn just removes the message from the Q (by analogy with .NET Peek &amp; Dequeue). That on its own should eliminate need for Monitor.</p>

<p>In my Win Service multiple threads read the Q and we suspect that due to a low polling interval (100ms and less) the wrapper doesn't get enough time to update 'Read' flag of the message, so it get's picked up more than once by overlapping threads. Historically the same message gets read up to four times.</p>

<p>Before increasing the polling interval, I wanted to make sure if I'm doing things the right way. Could anyone suggest on any problmes with my approach?</p>

<p>I'm using IBM Websphere Integration Developer...</p>

<p>I used JAX-WS runtime to create webservices from a Java test class, that instantiates severall other classes.</p>

<p>I did this by:</p>

<ol>
<li>Right clicking on the Java test
class</li>
<li><p>Web Services -> Create Web Service 
Service: Webshpere Process Manager v7.0 Web Service Runtime: IBM
Websphere JAX-WS</p></li>
<li><p>Checking ""Publish the Web Service"" -> Next -> Document Wrapped</p></li>
<li>Checking ""Generate WSDL file into the project""</li>
<li>Checking ""Configure WSDL service name"" -> Finish</li>
</ol>

<p>This resulted on the creating of a Delegate Java class on the same package of the test class
The creation of a WSDL file and an XSD file.</p>

<p>The Web Service is working great an this is solved...</p>

<p>No I need to have a similar process to generate a REST web service, and found out the JAX-RS API.</p>

<p>In order to have this I installed the ""Websphere Application Server Feature Pack for Web 2.0"" and thought that by doing this I would have the abilitty to use no only JAX-WS, JAX-RPC, but also JAX-RS, but this doesn't work.</p>

<p>I need the ability to generate REST Web Services automatically from a Java text class so is or isnt this possible?</p>

<p>The two approaches that we are considering are to access the other organization's Queue Manager directly from our clients and the alternative is to have a Queue manager locally that would pump the messages from the remote queue and then local clients will access it. I think that both have merit but I am not sure of the trade-offs between the two architectures.</p>

<p>The volume that we would have to handle is 600 per second with message size of about 50 bytes. The other org's queue manager is not changeable (and it is WebSphere MQ). The messages have to be processed in order. Perhaps they can be split between different queues and then each queue to be processed by separate client but in each queue the order is still very important. In general there would be one transaction processing client. There could be one additional business intelligence client that would process a copy of the message.</p>

<p>Specifically, suppose that I write source code for a class 'A' that imports a 3rd-party class 'Z' (and uses Z).  I understand that at compile-time, the Java compiler must have ""access"" to the information about Z in order to compile A.java, creating A.class. Therefore, either Z.java or Z.class (or a JAR containing one of these; say Z.jar) must be present on the local filesystem at compile time - correct?</p>

<p>Does the compiler use a class loader to load Z (to reiterate - at compile time)?</p>

<p>If I'm correct that a class loader is used at COMPILE time, what if a user-defined class loader (L) is desired - and is part of the project being compiled?  Suppose, for example, that L is responsible for downloading Z.class AT RUNTIME across a network?  In this scenario, how will the Java compiler obtain Z.class at compile time?  Will it attempt to compile L first, and then use L at compile time to obtain Z?</p>

<p>I understand that using Maven to build the project, Z.jar can be located on a remote repository over the internet at compile time - either on ibiblio, or on a custom repository defined in the POM file.  I hope I'm correct that it is MAVEN that is responsible for downloading the 3rd-party JAR file at compile time, rather than the compiler's JVM?</p>

<p>Note, however, that at RUNTIME, A.class again requires Z.class - how will JRE know where to download Z.class from (without Maven to help)?  Or is it the developer's responsibility to ship Z.class along with A.class with the application (say in the JAR file)?  (...assuming a user-defined class loader is not used.)</p>

<p>Now a related question, just for confirmation: I assume that once compiled, A.class contains only symbolic links to Z.class - the bytecodes of Z.class are not part of A.class; please correct me if I'm wrong.  (In C++, static linking would copy the bytes from Z.class into A.class, whereas dynamic linking would not.)</p>

<p>Another related question regarding the compilation process: once the necessary files describing Z are located on the CLASSPATH at compile time, does the compiler require the bytecodes from Z.class in order to compile A.java (and will build Z.class, if necessary, from Z.java), or does Z.java suffice for the compiler?</p>

<p>My overall confusion can be summarized as follows.  It seems that the full [byte]code for Z needs to be present TWICE - once during compilation, and a second time during runtime - and that this must be true for <em>ALL</em> classes referenced by a Java program.  In other words, every single class must be downloaded/present TWICE.  Not a single class can be represented during compile time as just a header file (as it can be in C++).</p>

<p>The problem is: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>User goes to /RuleList.do and sees the list of rules. <strong>ruleSearchForm</strong> used as a bean for transferring search params to /RulesList.do action. Initially tihs bean is empty, only getLevels() returns ""empty value"" + list of levels got from superclass method.</p></li>
<li><p>User goes to /CreateRule.do, <strong>ruleForm</strong> is used for collecting user input. <strong>levels</strong> property  is used in selectbox. And I get there list of levels + empty row. This empty row is not added in RuleForm (named ruleForm). It's added it subclass of RuleForm.  Why does super class ActionForm bean with NO static fields, with other name gets values from it's sublass instance???</p></li>
<li><p>If users saves Rule and has been redirected to /RuleList.do, the he sees populated (i.e. filled) search form (""ruleSearchForm"") with values from ""ruleForm"". </p></li>
</ol>

<p>What does it mean? Please help, I don't understand this mess of data beetween ActionForm Beans</p>

<p>UPD:
Now, I've changed inheritance of FormAction beans. I've introduced BaseFormBean. This BaseFormBean got two children: RuleForm and RuleSearchForm. 
It didn't help. Still attributes from one bean are moved to another.</p>

i)if app requires Websphere provides clustering and fail-over mechanism. 
ii) if app requires Websphere services like caching, JMS and Security services.
iii) if app need to interact with third party system/resource using JCA protocol

<p>An example problem: I want to create a simple web service - that can be called with or without a word as an argument. Without the argument, a list or words is sent back, and with a word from that list as an argument, its meaning. Word not in list - error message goes out.</p>

<p>Where do I start? I wrote the wsdl, could write the class file as a servlet too, but I'd like to do it the Websphere way, using Eclipse/JUnit for development/testing. Can anybody recommend a tutorial that explains the steps of doing something similar (in terms of simplicity)? I want to learn the EAR file structures, location and contents of scripts if they are used (e.g., ant), how/when dependencies are translated and the Xml marshalled, at what level Exceptions are handled, best logging practices, where the configuration files are and what can be configured, etc.</p>

<p>It's OK if the tutorial doesn't cover all of the above, I just need a good starting point, and material that I can read and understand. Don't need the layers/tiers of business models or DB access, just something simple to get my hands dirty. Thank you.</p>

<p>Other things to consider is our small company has a Mulesoft EE license, a company application stack (osgi bundles with Tomcat, ActiveMQ, Drools, etc..)</p>

<p>So, the initial draft approach I was thinking of from research alone before I try a POC is something like:</p>

<p>Using Mule as an ESB to integrate with the various applications, and then using its SEDA service to process and stage events to the Drools engine to process rules associated with these events.</p>

<p>I am not quite sure if this process is the way these tools were designed to be used, or if there is a better more eloquent way to handle this. Also some other outstanding questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>How can aggregation of events and status (warnings, kpi breaches, etc) be displayed to the user. GWT integration? Should the events be put into an in-memory db to be queried and displayed?</li>
<li>As far as the physical architecture, I was thinking of running the mule in clustered tomcat instances across two servers with the drools engines on the same servers? The database (for history storage) on its own servers.</li>
<li>I am not limited to the tools above, I was also looking at Esper, Apache Camel</li>
<li>Is this approach overkill? Can a more simple straight-forward webapp be used with RDBMS managing state? I figured the real-time and number of events requirements would prevent this.</li>

We will be splitting our entities across different schemas.  I've been tasked to do a spike to evaluate the suitability of different JPA implementations for this.</p>

<p>The two that I've told to focus on are <a href=""http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/"" rel=""nofollow"">EclipseLink</a> and Apache <a href=""http://openjpa.apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">OpenJPA/Slice</a>.  We have exclusively used Hibernate in the past, but <a href=""http://www.hibernate.org/subprojects/shards.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Hibernate Shards</a> is in beta, and appears no longer be actively developed (last release was in 2007), so we are not considering it.</p>

<p>I will be doing my own evaluation and trial implementations, but I don't trust that I will get a good feel for the overall quality of these implementations in the time that I've been given.  If you are using OpenJPA and/or EclipseLink in a production environment, especially if your database is shareded, I would like to hear about your experiences (positive and negative), your opinions about their overall quality, and if you'd make the same choice again if given the opportunity.</p>

<p>So far, I have my output from Eclipse placing the built classes in the <code>WEB-INF/classes</code> folder of my web application.</p>

<p>I also have a reloadable context, with the <code>web.xml</code> as a watched resource. Any edit / save to this file <em>does</em> reload my web app, taking just over one second - much quicker than building a new war file and deploying it in full.</p>

<p>However, what I'd like to do is trigger the redeploy when I edit any source file. As the .class files are being modified in Tomcat, it seems I just need to monitor any changes in the <code>WEB-INF/classes</code> folder and it's children. </p>

<p>I've read that I can add additional watched resources in Tomcat's <code>context.xml</code> but this doesn't seem to be quite what I need - unless it's possible to specify a directory that will be watched (including recursively monitoring sub folders and files)?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Context&gt;
  &lt;WatchedResource&gt;WEB-INF/web.xml&lt;/WatchedResource&gt;
  &lt;WatchedResource&gt;WEB-INF/someother.file&lt;/WatchedResource&gt;
  &lt;Manager pathname=""""/&gt;
&lt;/Context&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So essentially, my question is can I watch the entire classes folder (without including each <code>WatchedResource</code> explicitly) to trigger a redeploy in Tomcat?</p>

<p>If not, can I configure Eclipse to <code>touch</code> the web.xml file, whenever I save a source file in that project? I'm developing on a Windows system. :(</p>

<hr>

<p>PS I'm not interested in the JRebel product. Any answer should be a <strong>free</strong> solution.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>According to the Tomcat <a href=""http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/config/context.html"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a>, the classes folder should be monitored by setting the context to reloadable:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Set to true if you want Catalina to
  monitor classes in /WEB-INF/classes/
  and /WEB-INF/lib for changes, and
  automatically reload the web
  application if a change is detected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only changes to the web.xml seem to trigger a reload. Is this a bug or is my setup incorrect?</p>

<p>Also, I've read about setting the <code>docBase</code> attribute for a given context:</p>

<pre><code>docBase=""webapps/someExample""
</code></pre>

<p>This appears to be close to what I need, as I could then republish in Eclipse quickly. My only problem is that I require several web apps / servlets to be running in Tomcat concurrently, on the same port etc.</p>

We have a few hundred (and growing) separate Java programs.  Most of them are individual Jasper Reports but some are bigger batch Java jobs. Currently, each Java Project is packaged an independent JAR file using Eclipse's export option. Those JARs are then deployed to our Linux server manually where they are tested. If they pass testing, they are then migrated up through QA and onto Production through a home grown source code control system.</p>

<p>Is this the best strategy for doing batch Java? Ongoing maintenance can be a hassle since searching Jar files is not easy and different developers are creating new Java Projects (new reports) every week. </p>

<p>Importing existing projects from the Jar files into Eclipse is a tricky process as well. We would like these things to be easier. We have thought about packaging all the code into 1 big project and writing an interface to be able to execute the desired ""package"" (aka program) maybe using a Web Server.</p>

<p>What are other people/companies doing out there with their batch Java programs? Are there any best practices out there on this stuff? Any help/ideas/working models would be appreciated. </p>

The current approach is to load the config into a single copy of static hashmap shared by the servlets when the init() method of any servlet is called. But the problem is the servlets just won't die, so the configuration just won't reset even if I changed the configuration in the servlet context. Because the servlet never call init() again, they will not reload the configuration into the hashmap. </p>

<p>I am using websphere 7, is there any place I can configure when does a servlet die, and a new servlet is born?</p>

<p>I think it is too clumsy to reload the configuration from the servlet context when there is a new request.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit:
I have a scheduler which will create a new thread to check for a specific data file, if the data file was new, it will create a hashmap(with content of the data file) as an attribute in the servlet context.</p>

<p>Now the servlets will check for the servlet context for the hashmap and copy it to a static hashmap for shared use among servlets when they are just created and call init(). But the problem is that the servlet won't die during the execution, it just make the scheduled action not working.</p>

<p>Conceptually, JMS sounds simple.  My take is that it's an intermediate broker which manages messages from publishers and routes them to appropriate subscribers.  This is done by queueing messages as they are published, and dequeuing them as they are received.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1: Is my basic understanding of JMS correct?</strong></p>

<p>One of the things that bugs me when reading about technologies is when a certain level of (intentional or unintentional) hand-waving is done about a feature.</p>

<p>Based on my basic understanding, a JMS Provider must be running in order to send or receive messages.  My assumption on publishing is that the JMS Provider simply waits until a message is published, then stores it in a queue (memory or database-backed, depending on implementation).  However, I am not quite sure how receive works.</p>

<p><strong>Question 2: Does receive (typically) block if no messages are avaiable?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Question 2b: If so, how is blocking achieved?  Does the client continuously poll for messages?  Does the server simply not respond until a message is published (how does this work without timing out?)  Does the provider initiate a call to the recipient?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Question 2c: If not, how does one ensure messages are received in a timely manner, without impacting performance?</strong></p>

<p>The basic description seems to lean towards a single JMS provider to ensure that messages are centrally managed not lost.  I can see scaling being an issue.</p>

<p><strong>Question 3: How does JMS scale?</strong></p>

<p>When scaling, I can see there being complexities to ensure that a single message is delivered to all appropriate subscribers, regardless of which physical server receives the message.</p>

<p><strong>Question 3b: How does a JMS implementation ensure reliable delivery in a scaled environment?</strong></p>

<p>Please note that although these questions are related to JMS, they likely apply to any messaging infrastructure.  I welcome answers specific to JMS as well as those which are more general or even specific to another technology.</p>

<p>My Enterprise Application Project (the 'EAR' project) has two module projects : 
- service
- web</p>

<p>The service project has some stuff in it, all wired up using Spring.</p>

<p>The web project has its own stuff in it, all wired up using Spring. The UI stuff in the web project needs to use the stuff in the service project.</p>

<p>Both projects are included in the EAR project as modules.</p>

<p>The web project lists the 'service' project as a dependent project in the build path, it's checked off for export, and also has it listed as a EE Module Dependency.</p>

<p>I'm having a really hard time to get this working though:</p>

<p>The spring context in the web project is of course what gets loaded when the application is deployed, and it imports the spring config I need from the service project. This seems to be working fine.</p>

<p>When spring tries to instantiate a bean it throws a ClassNotFoundException. On the very first bean. </p>

<p>I tried simply copying the spring config from my service context and pasting it into my web context, but I got the same ClassNotFoundException.</p>

<p>I have tried instantiating an object of that type (the class that spring says cannot be found) in the java controller class in the web project, and it is successful, both at compile time (no compile errors) and at runtime (no exceptions).</p>

<p>So the classes from my service project are not available on the classpath when spring tries to use them.</p>

When using a queue with the jms:listener-container there is a concurrency property, however, with a topic it states to keep concurrency at 1.  Given that, what are my options for thread-pooling a topic subscriber?</p>

<p>I started out with the MessageListener route with the implementation of onMessage with:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;bean id=""messageListener"" class=""com.app.mdp.Receiver""/&gt;
    &lt;jms:listener-container container-type=""default""
        connection-factory=""connectionFactory"" acknowledge=""auto"" concurrency=""1""
        destination-type=""topic"" prefetch=""1""&gt;
        &lt;jms:listener destination=""topTopic"" ref=""messageListener""
            method=""onMessage"" subscription=""ASub"" /&gt;
    &lt;/jms:listener-container&gt;

    &lt;bean id=""connectionFactory"" class=""org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean""&gt;
        &lt;property name=""jndiName"" value=""jms/jms-top-notx"" /&gt;
    &lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this is I get at most one thread receiving data from JMS at a time.</p>

<p>I then attempted to use a task executor with config:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id=""taskExecutor"" class=""org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskExecutor""&gt;
  &lt;property name=""corePoolSize"" value=""10"" /&gt;
  &lt;property name=""maxPoolSize"" value=""20"" /&gt;
  &lt;property name=""queueCapacity"" value=""0"" /&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>..but it seems to require concurrency to be of a greater value in the jms:listener-container setup (unless I am misunderstanding).  Still I only received one thread at a time.</p>

<p>I am at a bit of a loss and starting to think that spring does not have functionality to support multiple threads when subscribing to JMS topic data.  If that is the case my options seem to be:</p>

<ul>
<li>implement my own thread pool. schedule subscriber->loop through jmsTmplate.receive() data->pass each message to a predefined thread</li>
<li>revert back to EJBs (which I don't want to do)</li>
<li>something else I have yet to think of</li>

The relatively useless error message displayed is:</p>

It seems a lot of large projects have chosen it over flex, such as the streaming music service Pandora.  I'm interested in why.  So far the biggest advantage I have seen is that it has an abstraction layer for support of flash 6,7, 8, 9 and dhtml and has been in development for a longer time (so possibly more stable). </p>

<p>Has anyone had much experience using both, or just openlaszlo even? is the support for dhtml and older flash versions really that big of an advantage with the popularity of flash 9 these days? Might this just be because of many developers are already comfortable with javascript/ajax? Besides language preferences, why openlaszlo and not flex?</p>

<p>First the device wakes up and initiates a ssl connection and submits its credentials to the server; the server verifies the credentials and generates a SHA based token, based on the credentials + some random input, and sends the token back to the device</p>

<p>This token must be present as a header in each http request that the device sends up. The server will use  a servlet filter that looks for this header and filters out messages that don't have it.</p>

<p>There is no sensitive information transferred, I just want to make sure that the device talking to the server is a valid one, and not someone trying to mess around with invalid data. (Wannabe hackers, script kiddies etc..)</p>

<p>The token needs to be stored somewhere where multiple 'nodes' can verify that the request is valid - where do you recommend doing this ?</p>

<p>I can think of 3 approaches</p>

<p>1) Have a separate web service that maintains tokens and does the authentication ( I cringe on the performance overhead of this for each request)</p>

<p>2) Maintain a Set of authenticated token in the Session, and let the servlet container take care of it using the built in clustering support (Not sure if this is the most fool proof way )</p>

<p>3) Use a database to store the tokens and verify it (Considering Redis for this)</p>

<p>Also, I think this approach has a vulnerability of allowing man in the middle attacks, but since the client sends data only for a few minutes I am taking a chance, any better approaches would be welcome.</p>

<p>For each of the given list of accounts we need to retrieve some information.</p>

<p>Currently we have something like this to communicate with MQ:</p>

<pre><code>responseObject getInfo(requestObject){
    code to send message to MQ
    code to retrieve message from MQ
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see we wait until it finishes completely before proceeding to the next account.
Due to performance issues we need to rework it.</p>

<p>There are 2 possible scenarios that I can think off at the moment.</p>

<p>1) Within an application to create a bunch of threads that would execute transport adapter for each account. Then get data from each task. I prefer this method, but some of the team members argue that transport layer is a better place for such change and we should place extra load on MQ instead of our application.</p>

<p>2) Rework transport layer to use publish/subscribe model.
Ideally I want something like this:</p>

<pre><code>void send (requestObject){
  code to send message to MQ
}

responseObject receive()
{
  code to retrieve message from MQ
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I will just send requests in the loop, and later retrieve data in the loop. The idea is that while first request is being processed by the back end system we don't have to wait for the response, but instead send next request.</p>

<p>My question, is it going to be a lot faster than current sequential retrieval?</p>

<p>About the votes to close my topic. 
I'm asking a question, if I need to explain here what it is, probably I'll not know how to answer. People that know what I was talking about could answer without problems, like Daniele and Jeroen Pluimers.</p>

<p>But for those that don't know what is a MQ:
Here you can learn the basic of it: <a href=""http://mq.java.net/overview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mq.java.net/overview.html</a>
After learn what it is you can read about the brokers as: ActiveMQ, HornetQ, GlassFish, RabbitMQ etc...
And as now you know, we need a client to talk with the brokers, is this client that I'm searching for, in this case one of the options (few options) is <a href=""http://www.habarisoft.com/habari_openmq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.habarisoft.com/habari_openmq.html</a>.</p>

<pre><code>'Cannot convert 01.01.10 00:00 of type class java.util.Date to class org.apache.openjpa.util.java$util$Date$proxy 
</code></pre>

<p>Using a JPA-managed date value (which means it is proxied) works fine when it is used directly from the EL likes this: </p>

<pre><code>'&lt;h:outputLabel value=""MyDateValue"" for=""input""/&gt; 
'&lt;h:inputText id=""inputDate"" value=""#{bean.myDate}""/&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>However, it causes trouble when trying to use it  with composite components 
  and gives back the following converter exception and thus can't update the model... </p>

<p>The (simplified) JSF composite component inputDate.xhtml
 </p>

<pre><code>    &lt;head&gt; 
            &lt;title&gt;A date input field&lt;/title&gt; 
    &lt;/head&gt; 

    &lt;composite:interface&gt; 
            &lt;composite:attribute name=""dateValue""/&gt;

    &lt;/composite:implementation&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p> </p>

<p>Assumption: 
It seems the proxy replacement in OpenJPA is handled differently when the value is being accessed from inside a composite. My guess is the EL-resolver handles calls to object values differently when it is passed to composites. Passing it to composites means it is first accessed within the composite, which is too late and the required replacement of the proxy is not accomplished (thus the converter exception)</p>

<p>So I tried to change the Expression Language for MyFaces, but it didn't work in Websphere, even though I changed the class loading to parent last and provided el-impl and el-api from glassfish in the lib folder and inserted the necessary context-param for MyFaces</p>

<p>How do you guys use JPA-managed dates (or other proxied entities) in composite components???</p>

<p>So you see, based on the DTD, the program asks for all pieces of data necessary to create an XML document. The program follows a pattern:</p>

<ul>
<li>It starts at the top of the tree (that the user supposedly has in his
imagination, a CD Collection in this case) and travels down the tree
in preorder fashion.</li>
<li>Elements labeled with a ""+"" are required at least once, elements with
a ""*"" are required zero or more times, elements with a ""?"" are
required zero or one times, and elements with no such label are
required exactly once. For the purpose of this description, i will
call these labels ""quantity labels""</li>
<li>When the program arrives at an element of level X for the first time
on its way to the end of the first branch of the tree, it does one of
four things depending on the aforementioned labels: If the element's
label is a ""+"" or nothing, then it is assumed that the element is
required and moves on to obtain attribute data for the said element
or moves on to the next element if there are no attribute values to
prompt for. If the element's label is ""*"" or ""?"", then the program
asks the user if such an element exists. If yes, then the program
creates the element and prompts for attribute values if necessary,
before moving on. If no, then the program jumps to the next type of
element at level X if any, or else moves back up the tree to continue
preorder. If the element at level X is a final element that contains
#CDATA or #PCDATA (etc), then the program prompts for such data, or
leaves the element as EMPTY if necessary. Essentially, elements and
absolute data points are created in preorder.</li>
<li>When the program jumps back up the tree to a root of a branch, the
program analyzes the quantity labels once again. If the root element
at level X-1 has a label of ""+"" or ""*"", the program asks if more of
such elements exist (are to be entered, recorded, created, etc). This
is the mechanism by which the program discovers branches to traverse
in preorder. Elements at level X-1 who are roots of level-X elements
that contain a ""?"" label or nothing are not checked because they can
only exist in a quantity of at most one, so their presence (or
non-presence) is already determined as the program traverses down the
tree (away from root) as described in the previous step.</li>
</ul>

<p>The program continues like this (with more DTD rules that I may have missed applied as necessary) until it finally gets back to the root element (cd_collection in this case), at which point the program has enough information to write an XML file containing all the aquired datat.</p>

<p><em>[/end imagination]</em></p>

<p>In that imaginary scenario, the example was a command line program. However, it could also be a graphical web interface. For example, instead of prompting for data piece by piece like this:</p>

<pre><code>What is the title attribute of album 2? Live From Mars [enter]
What is the artist attribute of album 2? Ben Harper [enter]
What is the label attribute of album 2? Virgin Records [enter]
</code></pre>

<p>it could be obtained in an HTML form like this:</p>

<pre><code>album 2:

    title:  ____Live From Mars____
    artist: ____Ben Harper _______
    label:  ____Virgin Records ___

Database - Oracle 11g
Datasources - multiple XA recources involved
Tx mgr - JTA</p>

<p>Here are the results of the experiments I have done so far:</p>

<p><strong>Experiment 1 - Rely on read uncommitted</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Read the db record</li>
<li>Lock the record by id in another table, as part of the global JTA transaction</li>
<li>Process the record
A second transaction which tries to lock the same record will fail, will drop the record.
But for this to work the RDBMS should allow dirty reads.
Unfortunately Oracle does not support read uncommitted isolation level.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Experiment 2 - Lock record in local transaction</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Read the db record</li>
<li>Lock the record by id in another table, as a separate local transaction</li>
<li>Process the record and delete the record when the transaction commits successfully
A second transaction which tries to lock the same record will fail, will drop the record. This approach is based on committed data, should work fine.
Here is the problem - Since the lock transaction and the global parent are different, if the processing fails rolling back the main transaction, I should compensate by rolling back the lock transaction, which I do not know how to do - <strong>Need help here</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>If Iam not able to rollback the record locking transaction, would have to write some dirty logic around the record locking code. I dont prefer this.</p>

<p>This appears to be a very common requirement. I would like to know how you guys handle this elegantly.
Does Oracle support in any way making uncommitted updates visible to all transactions.</p>

I have a WSDL. I want to generate a web service for that WSDL. I know that I have to manually write something, but that's the part I need help.</p>

<p>I have a WSDL. I save it in /home/username/java/ws/wsdl/test.wsdl. I also have an xsd at /home/username/java/ws/wsdl/test.xsd used by the aforementioned WSDL.</p>

<p>I generate the server stubs for this like so:</p>

<pre><code>[/home/username/java/ws/wsdl/] $ wsimport -p com.uptimeservice.ws -d build/classes -s src wsdl/test.wsdl
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I need an implementor. I create one like so under /home/username/java/ws/src/WsImpl.java:</p>

<pre><code>package com.uptimeservice;  

import javax.jws.WebService;  

import com.uptimeservice.ws.*;  

@WebService(name = ""UptimeService"",
        targetNamespace = ""test"",  
    serviceName = ""UptimeService"",  
    portName = ""UptimeServiceSOAP"",  
    endpointInterface = ""com.uptimeservice.ws.UptimeService"",

public UptimeResponseType uptimeRequest(UptimeRequestType msg) {  
    UptimeResponseType resp = null;
        return resp;  
    }  
}  
</code></pre>

<p>I compile it like so:
[/home/username/java/ws/src/] $ javac -classpath /home/username/java/ws/build/classes/:. com/uptimeservice/WsImpl.java</p>

<p>Then when I try to deploy the service, like so:
/home/username/java/ws/src/] $  java -classpath /home/username/java/ws/build/classes/:. com/uptimeservice/WsImpl</p>

<p>I get the error:
Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: main</p>

<p>My guess is that this is something very trivial, but I am not a Java person.</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

I am not sure why this happens. The servlets implement the <code>POST</code> but not the rest of the methods.<br>
Is this programming issue?  Should I have overriden <code>doOptions</code> for example, or can I configure something in Tomcat instance and get away with it?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>What am I trying to achieve?</p>

<p>I need to write a standalone program to access a particular instance or multiple instances of Websphere Application Server and get details from it.  As far as my research goes, there are two ways to do this.</p>

<ol>
<li>Adaptors</li>
<li>Connectors</li>
</ol>

<p>I am currently taking up the 'Connectors' approach and that too the SOAP connector (for its firewall friendliness)</p>

<p>So, my code would be something like this..</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>// Initialize the AdminClient.
Properties adminProps = new Properties();

adminProps.setProperty(""type"", AdminClient.CONNECTOR_TYPE_SOAP );
adminProps.setProperty(""host"", ""localhost"");
adminProps.setProperty(""port"", ""8880"");
AdminClient adminClient = AdminClientFactory.createAdminClient(adminProps);

String query = ""WebSphere:*"";
//String query = ""WebSphere:type=Server,*"";
ObjectName queryName = new ObjectName(query);
Set s = adminClient.queryNames(queryName, null);
if (!s.isEmpty()) {
    iter = s.iterator();
    while (iter.hasNext()) {
        ObjectName nodeagent = (ObjectName) iter.next();
    System.out.println(""*********************************************"");
        System.out.println(""KeyPropertyList: "" + nodeagent.getKeyPropertyListString());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>With this piece of code, I am able to get the list of all the MBeans on that particular instance of the WAS (C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer\profiles\AppSrv01) and it successfully prints the Key - Property list.</p>

<p>Now I have a list of MBeans.  What next?
Link: _http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.javadoc.doc/web/mbeanDocs/index.html</p>

<p>Here is my query:</p>

<p>How do I get an instance of a particular MBean I am interested in and fetch all related properties?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>AppManagement appM = AppManagementProxy.getJMXProxyForClient (adminClient);
System.out.println(appM.listApplications(null, null, null));
</code></pre>

<p>Would list all the application(s) on that particular instance of WAS</p>

<p>[query, SamplesGallery, ivtApp, DefaultApplication, PlantsByWebSphere]</p>

<p>I am interested in knowing more about the applications installed say, are they up and running? If so, the IP Address, build number, is it in maintenance, etc., (just quoting them as an example)  If I can get all possible details of the application that the MBean could offer, then it would complete my task (partly)</p>

<p>The aforementioned is just an example and I would like to get more out of MBeans.  So, please provide a solution / sample code that would help me out in getting information from any MBean the WAS instance has to offer. (Using JMX)</p>

<p>I'm converting several client web services from JAX-RPC to JAX-WS, and we implement the WS-Security header with a custom username token generator. For JAX-RPC, this is done via a simple wizard, where you create the token and token generator, and it inserts the WSSE information at runtime (using the custom CallbackHandler).

<p>They're looking to replace their current external facing web application, which was built with ASP.NET WebForms some time ago and definitely needs replacing.</p>

<p>At the moment, WebSphere Portal is being touted as the product to build the web application on. As far as I can tell it's useful for intranets or extranets but not for bespoke web applications.</p>

<p>A prototype of what the replacement web application might look like has been built already. It's been built purely for the client-side, so has static content. It follows best practice in terms of web standards, accessibility and front-end performance. It achieves this with a mixture of semantic HTML (some HTML5 tags), CSS3 and JS to progressively enhance the site, and OO JS to keep things tidy and well structured and jQuery to manipulate the DOM when appropriate.</p>

<p>The company in question has a large customer base that they service via other channels, e.g. telephone and shops as well as via the web channel. They can purchase products and/or services from any of the channels but I guess the important thing is that the same data is available across the channels. This points to some enterprise solution.</p>

<p>I understand WebSphere Portal offers a lot out of the box in terms of personalisation and security, and probably fits in well with the nature of the enterprise. I've had a few conversations with architects and developers about Portal but whenever I raise the question about the front-end and its performance it goes in one ear and out of the other.</p>

<p>What I don't understand is how much control a web developer has over the interface? Does the sheer divvying up of parts of the site into Portlets stop a decent front-end developer doing his/her job well? Will the well-crafted prototype (if I say so myself) still be well performing after being portalised?</p>

<p>How does IBM WebSphere Portal hinder or help the goal of fast, accessible, usable web apps? What are your experiences of WebSphere Portal developers working through this issues and helping front-end devs to provide the best UI they can?</p>

<p><em><strong>Clarification and rephrasing of question</em></strong></p>

<p>Based on first answer I have re-phrased the question but I think the points I mentioned above are still valid for setting context.</p>

<p>WebSphere Portal offer a number of capabilities that are aimed at the enterprise, like social media capabilities between employees, calendars, news widgets, weather widgets, etc... Not a single out-of-the-box portlet overlaps with the needs of the customer-facing web application.</p>

<p>I am having difficulty in understanding the role of Portal if none of its typical intranet-type portlet functionality would be used in the web application.</p>

<p>So my worry, which may or may not be founded, is that by using Portal to develop a web application, it will put unnecessary hurdles in the way of controlling the build of the front-end.</p>

<p>My understanding of a portal is something like a typical intranet site, or the Yahoo homepage or MSN or NetVibes; a website that allows personalisation, dropping'n'dragging of customisable widgets. Whereas a web application is focused, like a share-dealing web app, online-banking, an e-commerce site, or a betting site, all of which can be logged into and tasks can be carried out. Perhaps these types of web applications could form part of a portal, so, for example, a portal would be a launch-pad into these web applications.</p>

<p>I think my question has changed to is WebSphere Portal the right technology to build a web application, based on the definitions I've stated above? And, if not, why not? And vice versa?</p>

<p>Let me know what will be the solution for this.</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks for your inputs Manglu. Now I am confident that there should not be a compatibility issue for having WAS 7 + MQ 6 on Solaris 9. IBM website also says the this combination is supportable.</p>

<p>So the main challenge for me to find out the proper configuration.</p>

<p>Any more inputs on this configuration would be more helpful.</p>

<p>Yes, the MQ 6 is at the end of service life however the MQ 6 upgrade is considered in the pipeline but at the moments we are trying to make WAS 7 works with MQ 6.</p>

<p>I want to avoid the manual step of extracting the existing properties file and editing it.  The scripts needs to run completely unattended.  In fact, I'd prefer to not use a file at all, but just set the property to a value directly in the script.</p>

<p>Something like the following pseudo-code:</p>

<pre><code>defaultwmId = AdminConfig.getid(""wm/default"")
AdminTask.setProperty(defaultwmId, ['-propertyName', maxThreads, '-propertyValue', 20])

<p>Number of request can be between 400 - 600. On each request to server, I am creating 15 threads( using Java ExecutorService) for requesting 15 different webservies simultaneously and group all the responses data together and send it back to user.
Load test fails at nearly 150 - 170  users. CPU and memory spikes are seen in DB servicing these webservices and eventually after a very short period of time app server too crashes.
Response time of webservice is 10-12 sec max and 4-6 secs min. Connection pooling size of the DB is 40.</p>

<p>I am assuming that 150 request are creating 150*15=2250 threads and app server resources are being spiked  and hence crashing.  So I want to use App server threadpool and have threadCount say 100 (may not be good number..). One thing thats troubling me is, with 100 threads I can process first 6 (6*15 = 90) requests and 10 calls of 7th request. The next requests have to wait for 10-15 secs for getting the threads back and then another 10-15 secs for its own webservice call.  Is this approach even good?</p>

<p>Another idea was asynchronous beans provided in Websphere.  Which one suits my requirement.</p>

<p>Please suggest!!. Calling one webservice after another takes a total of 15*(lets say 4sec for each request) = 60 secs which is really bad. So calling webserices together is what I want to do. </p>

<p>This will solve three problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Webapps using JNI (where the JNI code changes between restarts) cannot be restarted. There is no way to guarantee that the old webapp has been garbage-collected before loading the new webapp, so when the code invokes System.loadLibrary() the JVM throws: <code>java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Native Library x already loaded in another classloader.</code></li>
<li>Libraries leak memory every time a webapp is reloaded, eventually forcing a full server restart. Tomcat has made headway in addressing this problem but it will never be completely fixed.</li>
<li>Faster restarts. The mechanism I'm proposing would allow near-instant webapp restarts. We no longer have to wait for the old webapp to finish unloading, which is the slowest part.</li>

<p>I'm using Scala v2.9.0.1</p>

<p>How can I diagnose this class linkage problem?</p>

<p><strong>Edit #1</strong></p>

<p>On some reflection I realised that the problem occured after an unrelated change. On a hunch I fully uninstalled the application from WAS and then reinstalled it. The problem was gone. The problem recurred after the next application <em>update</em> (i.e. overwrite).</p>

<p>After several more hours, and other changes unlreated to Scala XML parsing, I forgot to uninstall/reinstall and did an update instead. The problem did not recur. I can no longer replicate the issue.</p>

<p><strong>Edit #2</strong></p>

<p>The problem came back and can not be solved with uninstall/reinstall alone. Retried with Scala 2.8.1, but the problem persists. Will now try uninstall/turn off server/delete temp files/reinstall/restart server. Wish me luck.</p>

My portlet is trying to make a db2 connection to a remote server. I wrote a java program locally to do a basic JDBC connection to the server and get records from a table. The code works fine; however, when I add the code to my portlet as well as the db2jcc4.jar, the connection doesn't work. I'm using the basic: </p>

<pre><code>Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(""jdbc:db2://server:port/db:user=user;password=pw;"");

<p>I figure that using the Websphere datasource is the right way to go. I know the JNDI name for the datasource, but I'm not finding clear cut examples on how to make a connection. Several examples use a DataSource class (I typed this in and this doesn't seem like it comes from a native java package so what import do I use here?) coupled with a Context. I've come across code like: </p>

<pre><code>Context ctx = new InitialContext();
ctx.lookup(""jdbc/xxxx"");

<p>I've tried tracing in Fiddler to no avail - I can't get the WCF test client to submit requests through the proxy it creates despite modifying it's app.config file. I have traced my SOAP request however can can see the following:</p>

<pre><code>Content-Type: text/xml; charset=""utf-8""

<p>As far as I can tell, the message I am sending should be ok - outside of the headers and the message content I can't see what else could be sent.</p>

<p>Last thing I should say is that I am by no means a WCF expert and I have had to change the specific SOAPAction value due to commercial sensitivity..</p>

<p>Can anyone offer any help on this rather frustrating problem?</p>

The session facade beans make updates to the entity beans but the updates are persisted to database (call to ejbStore() methods of entity beans) at the end of the transaction which causes problem as the updates are not visible to other client withing the transaction. In Weblogic there is a setting ""delay-updates-until-end-of-tx"" which can be set to false. This causes the updates to be persisted without waiting for the end of the transaction. I read that the default behavior of Websphere is to not wait for the end of the transaction but it does not seems to work like that.</p>

<p>A JSESSIONID. This is your HTTPSession ID as far as I can tell.
An LTPA2 token. This is your “single sign on” session as far as websphere is concerned.</p>

<p>Now, IBM say that a single hosted application cannot invalidate the LTPA2 token when a user is signing out. The thinking behind this is that it is an SSO identifier, so a single application should not be able to invalidate it as it is intended for use across multiple applications. There is no configuration in WAS to declare “this environment hosts only one application so therefore that app can invalidate the LTPA2 token”.</p>

<p>What is worrying is that these LTPA2 sessions hang around for a configurable amount of time. Therefore, if another user got a handle on a users’ LTPA2 token, they can use it to access that users’ session and therefore their sensitive data.</p>

<p>You can prevent a man in the middle attack to capture the session value by forcing the transmission of the cookie to occur over SSL, and by specifying HTTP only for cookies. However, I am still worried about the cookie being available on the local machines’ hard drive. The browser has to store it somewhere, so therefore there has got to be a way to get access to it?</p>

<p>My question is, is it possible for someone to get an LTPA2 value such as this from the hard drive? Say someone sits down in a library, signs in to their online banking, does some work and then logs out. Is it possible for the next user to get the LTPA2 token somehow?</p>

<p>I tried searching through the directories where I thought FireFox 4 and IE8 would store the cookie, but couldn’t pattern match the value. My gut instinct is that it may be possible to find this data on certain browsers?</p>

<p>But haven't been able to make it work. I've been trying to find an example or tutorial on how to actually use it.</p>

<p>Here's what I have so far:</p>

<pre>
        Project p = new Project();
        p.setUserProperty(""ant.file"", buildFile.getAbsolutePath());
        p.fireBuildStarted();
        p.init();

<p>I tried specifying the project with:</p>

<pre>
p.setUserProperty(""ant.project.name"", ""VSS Project"");
</pre>

<p>But no luck.</p>

<p>The ant file specified is correct as it works perfectly from the command line.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>After some more searching I got here: <a href=""http://onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2002/07/24/antauto.html?page=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2002/07/24/antauto.html?page=1</a></p>

<p>It is a great tutorial.</p>

<p>Here's the code I got a little bit earlier than seeing the code in the answer below:</p>

<pre>
        Project project = new Project();
        ProjectHelper.configureProject(project, buildFile);
        DefaultLogger consoleLogger = new DefaultLogger();
        consoleLogger.setErrorPrintStream(System.err);
        consoleLogger.setOutputPrintStream(System.out);
        consoleLogger.setMessageOutputLevel(Project.MSG_INFO);
        project.addBuildListener(consoleLogger);
        project.init();
        project.executeTarget(project.getDefaultTarget());
</pre>

<p>But for some reason the task still fails! I'm using a Visual Source Safe task that needs to read an environment value at runtime but it doesn't see it with this approach. Running the build.xml file manually and with the following code works:</p>

<pre>
        ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder();
        Map env = pb.environment();
        String path = env.get(""ANT_HOME"");
        System.out.println(path);
        pb.directory(new File(System.getProperty(""user.home"")));
        pb.command(path + System.getProperty(""file.separator"")
                + ""bin"" + System.getProperty(""file.separator"") + ""ant.bat"");
        try {
            Process p = pb.start();
        } catch (IOException ex) {
            //
        }

<p>That should do it, if we log in to the machine with the websphere user, we can create folders and files in that path; but our java web app can´t create a directory and it fails. </p>

<p>I'm trying to get an very simple java application with jsf and jpa running, but there seems to be a problem with the enhancement of my entities. As far as I know, tries OpenJPA to enhance my entities at runtime, which are listet in the <code>persistence.xml</code>, however there is no agent to do this. The keyword for this is: <code>Enhancing at Runtime</code>, right?</p>

<p>I thought the enhancement will automatically done by the application server at deployment? How can I configure this?</p>

<li>Glassfish 3.1.1</li>
<li>Derby, which is integrated in Glassfish</li>

<p><strong>Update #1:</strong></p>

<p>After some comments I've added the following lines to my <code>persistence.xml</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;property name=""openjpa.DynamicEnhancementAgent"" value=""false""/&gt;
&lt;property name=""openjpa.RuntimeUnenhancedClasses"" value=""supported"" /&gt;

<p>It works now, but OpenJPA throw this warning:</p>

This means that your application will be less efficient and will consume more memory than it would if you ran the OpenJPA enhancer. Additionally, lazy loading will not be available for one-to-one and many-to-one persistent attributes in types using field access; they will be loaded eagerly instead.

<p>I think this can't be the solution.</p>

<p>Refer to fvu's answer, I've tried to define the <code>-javaagent</code> jvm parameter in the <code>domain.xml</code> and over the web admin console. After a restart appeared the problem again.</p>

<p><strong>Update #3:</strong></p>

<p>Refer to update #2, I've played a bit around. There must be thrown an error, when the <code>-javaagent</code> parameter is used, but the file is missing, right?. Yes, there it is:</p>

<p>If I copying the agent to this location, this error doesn't appear, but openjpa could still not enhance my entities!</p>

<p>The QueueConnectionFactory instance is a <code>com.ibm.ejs.jms.JMSQueueConnectionFactoryHandle</code>. Could I get an XAConnection from this? Do I need to? I'd prefer to stay with vanilla JMS if possible.</p>

<p>The MDB implementation is akin to:</p>

<pre><code>public void onMessage(Message message) {
    // ^^ incoming message delivered from EMS queue via WAS MessageListener
    TextMessage textMessage = (TextMessage) message;
    QueueConnectionFactory factory = (QueueConnectionFactory) context.lookup(factoryName);
    Queue queue = (Queue) context.lookup(queueName);
    QueueConnection connection = factory.createQueueConnection();
    connection.start();
    QueueSession session = connection.createQueueSession(false, QueueSession.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
    QueueSender sender = session.createSender(queue);
    TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage(""some new payload"");
    sender.send(message);
    // ^^ outgoing message sent to WebSphere MQ queue
}

but wonder if I'm missing a trick by not evaluating ADF Faces. The big stumbling block
for me is the way ADF is clearly deliberately tied in with jDeveloper studio. I work
with NetBeans on a glassfish a/s, and as open as I am to change, I want to maximise
my existing experience and leverage this stability.</p>

<p>My (tentative) rationale is that perhaps a company with the resources of Oracle could,
perhaps, come up with a better quality product than other alternatives and with superior
functionality, and this is what I wish to evaluate.</p>

<p>So I just wondered if anyone had any experience they could share with respect to working
with ADF Faces outside a jDeveloper environment. Presumably from a technical perspective
it's not much more than extracting the necessary jars from the distribution and taking
it from there. Equally important would be any licensing/legal considerations of course.
I've read that ADF has a business layer however I'd want to continue working with a Java

<li><p>I have only recently found out, and was very surprised, to realise that ADF has the
third JSF core implementation, alongside Mojarrra and MyFaces. Is this just a case of
taking the RI and making a few necessary changes to support core ADF functionality or
more than that? I see from the JIRA that Ed Burns corresponds closely with the ADF
team, of course they now work for the same company. Clearly the RI has to mirror the
spec, and that takes time, so this in itself could be interesting.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><code>PutForwardMessage</code></li>
<li><code>PutReplyMessage</code></li>
<li><code>PutReportMessage</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I understand purpose of the first one because it takes passed message, makes a copy of the message and puts it to the queue but what is a purpose of second and third method?</p>

<p>The documentation for <code>PutReplyMessage</code> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Put a reply message onto the queue using message as the original message </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The documentation for <code>PutReportMessage</code> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Put a report message onto the queue using message as the original message </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing more. Really great and helpful doc.</p>

<p>It looks like all three methods do the same. They take original message passed to the method, makes a copy of the message (including body and properties) and sets some control fields like <code>MessageId</code> or <code>CorrelationId</code> based on original message and put the newly created message into the queue. The only difference between them is setting <code>MessageType</code> and probably some conditions how control headers should be copied. But why and when do I need these methods? </p>

<p>I would expect that <code>PutReplyMessage</code> will take a new message with reply body and original message with request and configure reply message with necessary fields like message type and correlation Id before putting it to the queue. This version seems pretty use less because I always have to create my own reply message to specify its content and configure everything myself. Once I do that, I can simply use the <code>Put</code> method instead of <code>PutReplyMessage</code>.</p>

<p>What is the purpose of realm-name in the login-config element?
Where do i configure the username, passwords and map the users to the roles?</p>

<p>When i try to access a jsp within my web application, i get asked for a username and password. What do i give there? And how does this security mechanism work? </p>

<p>I am completely new to security, so I will be grateful if someone can point me to a nice article which explains the basics of configuring security and how it actually works?</p>

The behaviour I require in this is that Messages with the same group ID are processed sequentially (though message ordering is irrelevant), and tying them to the same MDB-instance should provide that.</p>

<p>The messages do not carry any kind of sequence number (as it is irrelevant) and we do not know what the first or last message in a group is (there could theoratically ""never"" be a last message in a group). We want them to be delivered as soon as the consumer is able to receive them.</p>

<p>ActiveMQ provides this exact feature (<a href=""http://activemq.apache.org/message-groups.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://activemq.apache.org/message-groups.html</a>) by simply setting JMSXGroupID. We are bound to WebSphere MQ, though. All I've found out so far is that it is possible to collect Messages of the same group in the queue and using a MessageSelector to receive a ""Last Message in Group"" Message as described in <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/0602_currie/0602_currie.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/0602_currie/0602_currie.html</a>. We would prefer a cleaner way though (like in ActiveMQ). Does anyone know how to achieve that behaviour in WebSphere?</p>

Clients request information/jobs from the server and send new information/jobs (some parameters arrays, with sometimes up to 8000 array-elements) to the server.</p>

<p>The client and server are in PHP using SOAP in <strong>non-wsdl mode</strong> so far.</p>

<p>This is the example (unfortunately in German) I used:
<a href=""http://www.ordix.de/ORDIXNews/3_2008/Open_Source/PHP5_SOAP_WebServices.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ordix.de/ORDIXNews/3_2008/Open_Source/PHP5_SOAP_WebServices.html</a></p>

<p>This works fine. But now I want to optimize the client side(e.g. implement multithreading) and switch the clients to Java.</p>

<p>I'm not very expierenced in Java.
So I searched the web for many hours to find a simple but not to old school solution.
Ideally where I do not have to touch the server script.</p>

<p>Now I'm a little bit confused.
I found Apache XML-RPC as obsolete library.
JAX-RPC is now integrated in JAX-WS and at first sight a little bit to complex.</p>

<p>With Redstone XML-RPC I found another alternative but don't really know if this is the solution for me.</p>

<p>Before learning the ropes.. Is one of my mentioned libraries a good way to consume my non-wsd SOAP server script by a Java SOAP client?</p>

<p>This is exactly the question I wanted to ask, but isn't answered so far:
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5526741/easiest-way-to-write-a-java-soap-client-that-consumes-a-non-wsdl-php-soap-server"">Easiest way to write a Java SOAP client that consumes a non-wsdl PHP SOAP server?</a></p>

<p>What could I be doing wrong that jconsole doesn't want to connect to this jmx server? And what does <code>test</code> in the end of jmx url mean? I just saw that it like that in a tutorial so I wrote the same in my url.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong>
When I run <code>netstat -ntlp</code> on server I get this:
tcp6       0      0 :::10099                :::*                    LISTEN      10754/java</p>

<p>Where 10754 is the right java application. Is that correct? Running telnet <em>.</em>.*.* on 10099 I get a message that it connected to it too. So I guess it's not firewall on server side?</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong>
Okay well I'm trying now (and the exception bellow was thrown on server too) to run the app on my local environment (in Eclipse) and I guessing that it ain't server problem because all the same things happen.</p>

I actually googled for questions like ""What is the difference between servlets and RESTful services over HTTP"" and to sum up the community answers, I got :</p>

<ol>
<li>RESTful service development (on Jersey) is an architecture, which inherently uses servlets.</li>
<li>JAX-RS compliant tools like Jersey provide easy marhalling-unmarshalling of XML/JSON data, helping the developers.</li>
<li>REST helps us use GET/PUT/POST/DELETE in a fashion that is far efficient than normal servlets.</li>
</ol>

<p>According to these answers, I guess if I write a servlet which uses JAXB (for dealing with automatic serialization), and I efficiently use GET/POST/PUT/DELETE in my servlet code, I dont use a tool like Jersey, and hence JAX-RS.</p>

<p>I know I am terribly wrong passing this statement, please correct me.</p>

<p>PS : This doubt actually came in when I had to develop some RESTful services in PHP. After going on through some of the RESTful PHP codes, I realized they are just the same old PHP scripts, with some helper methods for handling XML/JSON.</p>

<p>I am using server 7 run time for IBM RSA 7.5.</p>

<p>So bascially RAD/RSA has websphere run times which allows to configure the server runtime start/stop within RAD/RSA. The run time allows you to develop webapps and test time on the server on deploy it on the websphere run time.</p>

<p>The problem i am facing is with the websphere runtime which works fine after computer reboot but is very slow after several deployments/publishing of the same web app.</p>

<p>On a new project we are extending a large commercial Java software package (Foo) with web services which requires some flexibility of deployment (as separate services, etc).  In particular, we want to avoid the necessity to include in each WAR file all of the Foo software dependency Jar files as they are numerous, large, and will be changing with patch/bugfix releases as we develop.  Similarly, it is highly undesirable to have to copy all of the dependencies into each Servlet container's ""lib"" directory.</p>

<p>Ideally, I would like to tell the Java application server that these WAR files must be loaded using a custom class loader which I will provide which automatically includes the Foo software dependency Jars.  Something like this (in Java-pseudocode):</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>public class MyWarFileClassLoader extends ClassLoader {
  protected URLClassLoader urlcl;
  public MyWarFileClassLoader(File warFile) {
    File installDir = System.getEnv(""FOO_HOME"");
    List&lt;File&gt; fooEntries = new File(installDir, ""jars"").listFiles(""*.jar"");
    fooEntries.add(new File(installDir, ""resources""));
    fooEntries.add(warFile);
    this.urlcl = new URLClassLoader(fooEntries);
  }
  public Class&lt;?&gt; findClass(String name) {
    return this.urlcl.findClass(name);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If there is no <em>standard</em> way to do this, is there a straightforward way to achieve the same goal for several WAR files, regardless of the target Servlet Container?</p>

<p><strong>[Edit]</strong></p>

<p>To put it another way: is there a common pattern for allowing WAR files to manage their own dependencies at runtime instead of relying on the Servlet Container configuration?  I could, of course, have the WAR file manifest include a <code>Class-Path</code> attribute but then the entries are still ""hardcoded"" at build time rather than detected automatically at runtime.</p>

I have nearly no hair left, having pulled it all out trying to get the thing to work. It <em>appears</em> that I've got everything set up right, but I get no response when I put a message to the associated queue.</p>

<p>Here's the EAR file setup:</p>

<pre><code>simplemdb.ear
    META-INF
        Manifest.mf
        application.xml
    simplemdb.jar
        META-INF
            Manifest.mf
            ejb-jar.xml
        com
            [ classes go here ]
</code></pre>

<p>I can't find any syntax for defining the queue's JNDI name in ejb-jar.xml, so instead I:</p>

<ul>
<li>Define a WebSphere activation spec. Name SimpleMDBActivationSpec, JNDI name jms/SimpleActivationSpec, Destination jms/SimpleMDBQueue.</li>
<li>Define a WebSphere queue. Name SimpleMDBQueue, JNDI name jms/SimpleMDBQueue, Queue name SIMPLE.MDB.QUEUE.</li>
<li>Define an MQ queue, name SIMPLE.MDB.QUEUE.</li>
<li>Deploy the EAR file. During the deployment, I'm asked to enter binding information. I select Activation Specification, then point the Target Resource JNDI Name and Destination JNDI name at the activation spec and queue, respectively.</li>
</ul>

<p>(The MDB code has no annotations.) At this point, the app points to the spec and queue, and the spec points to the queue - belt and suspenders. Naturally, I imagine that the app therefore knows about the queue. Full of hope, I put a message on the queue, and ... nothing. The onMessage event is supposed to use System.out to log a message. I see no message.</p>

<p>Clear documentation on this is conspicuous by its absence. Google gives LOTS of results, but none of them details how the configuration all fits together. There's lots of hand-waving about ibm-ejb-jar-bnd.xmi, but examples of the file are arcane, full of opaque numbers with no explanation about how they were generated, or how they relate to other parts of the configuration.</p>

<p>For goodness' sake. All I want to do is deploy an MDB, and have it write ""Hello, world"" when I put a message to a queue. I'm using vi and ant as my development and build tools. Can anybody out there give me an idea about what I'm missing?</p>

(C#) which is running properly.</p>

<p>Now I have to create another client application in JAVA using the same WSDL.

then for hostname verification and finally have tried to create the object of

<p>But while object creation I receive following exceptions. (WSDL not found).
Kindly note that in code I have assigned the new URL for service. And in
project I have attached the web reference (WSDL) which is kept in my
machine's D drive. So, Its was taking the URL as D:/xyz.wsdl but as its not
the correct path of URL so I changed it to ""https://localhost:

<p>As I said, My service is on our own developed webserver and it runs like a

<p>Lately in one project a discussion came up, about how deal with dependencies/libraries in Tomcat production environments:</p>

<p>In my projects I am deploying <strong>big WAR files</strong> holding all the required dependencies for the application in WEB-INF/lib folder. The only things I put in the tomcat/lib folder are the JAR files for JDBC connections managed by tomcat. </p>

<p>The customer has a long history with WebSphere and thinks the container should hold most of the the required dependencies. So they want to put JAR files for used frameworks or WebService API's (like Metro) in the tomcat/lib folder and have <strong>skinny WAR files</strong>.</p>

<p>The problem with that solution in my opinion is that if you have an application that requires another version of a dependency that is already included in the tomcat/lib folder you can get errors and strange behavior.</p>

<p>Is there some best practice or official document that talks about this issue? What is your opinion about this?</p>

<p>one is using RAS and other is JRC.</p>

<p>JRC is 100% java integration.</p>

<p>What I want to know is if I take the RAS approach, can I use it in a j2ee application that is supposed to go on a Websphere app server 7.0 app server on a AIX box?</p>

<p>Meaning can RAS report integration approach be OS independent like JRC?
Any advantage or disadvantage be great.. with some example/guide link. I already referred this:</p>

<p>The Endpoint is coded as</p>

<pre><code>class MySvcEndpoint implements MySvc_SEI {
   public SomeOtherComplexType[] myCall(String[] argStrings) 
         throws javax.xml.soap.SOAPException

<p>The WSDL generated contains the following entries:</p>

<p>As you can see, the 'argStrings' argument has disappeared, though it seems to recognize <em>something</em> should be there. Also, the return type seems to have disappeared too.</p>

<p>Anyway, when I generate stubs based on the WSDL, the interface generated is:</p>

   public void myCall() throws java.rmi.RemoteException;
}

<p>Has anyone come across this issue before, and if so how was it solved?</p>

<p>[Edit] OK, it seems to be when there is an array as the input argument. I've tried the following:</p>

<pre><code>public int m1(String s1) throws SOAPException {
   return 0;
}

public int[] m2(String s1) throws SOAPException {
   int[] a = { 0 };
   return a;

public int m3(String[] sArr) throws SOAPException {
   return 0;
}

public int[] m4(String[] sArr) throws SOAPException {
   int[] a = { 0 };

<p>The article starts with</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t understand why firms spend millions of dollars on Java
  application servers like Oracle Weblogic or IBM WebSphere Application
  Server. I get why firms spend money on Red Hat JBoss -- they want to
  spend less on application servers. But, why spend anything at all?
  Apache Tomcat will satisfy the deployment requirements of most Java
  web applications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and goes on giving some reasons why:</p>

<ul>
<li>You need an application container that supports EJBs.  </li>
<li>Optimized application servers optimize hardware  </li>
<li>Two-phase commit is serious  </li>
<li>Manageability  </li>
<li>Clustering supports scalability, performance, and availability  </li>
</ul>

<p>I love Tomcat and have developed on it, so I will be happy if all these are true. However, I don't see much convincing reasons that you don't need any other application server at all.</p>

<p>So, my question is: In what situations you think you need an (so called) <em>advanced</em> server like Weblogic/Websphere/JBoss. Is there a business case for Websphere/Weblogic/JBoss at all, or should Tomcat do almost always?</p>

<p>Is there something <em>essential</em> that Tomcat does not/can not provide?</p>

<p>As shown above, the CXF client is injected via a setter by Spring.  The code to contact the service is below:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; formNames = client.retrieveNames(formIdsList);

<p>Also, I don't know if this is related, but no trust managers are returned when I inspect the TLSClientParameters object on the CXF client at runtime.  The code to do the inspection is below:</p>

<pre><code>// Get the trust managers for this client.
Client proxy = ClientProxy.getClient(client);
HTTPConduit conduit = (HTTPConduit) proxy.getConduit();
TLSClientParameters tls = conduit.getTlsClientParameters();
TrustManager[] trustManagers = tls.getTrustManagers();  // trustManagers is null
</code></pre>

<p>Is there anything else that I need to do to get the Apache CXF client to trust the self-signed certificate?</p>

<p>I prefer to not have to specify the path to a truststore along with a password in the configuration file.</p>

<p>Most (90-95%) of our applications are based on .NET with Microsoft SQL Server 2008. We have sales cloud in Salesforce and planning to migrate more applications (to Force.com platform)  Salesforce in the coming years. We bought IBM Cast Iron for integrating our on-premise applications with Salesforce and possibly within our on-premise applications. Now after analyzing the existing applications and the existing integration (ad-hoc - SQL jobs, windows services,...), I felt that we needed an ESB as I realized that we have multiple ways that we use to talk with the applications (FTP, Web Services, CSV/Excel, SQL). Though Cast Iron can take any type of formats and can talk Web Services, FTP, etc..., I'm concerned about positioning the Cast Iron as the core integration platform as this will become a broker architecture (similar to Hub and Spoke) that follows traditional EAI approach which may suffer from single point of failure and performance issues as the orchestrations increase. </p>

<p>By introducing ESB, I think I'll achieve at least the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scalability</li>
<li>Reliability</li>
<li>High performance</li>
</ul>

<p>The attached diagram reflects a simplified version of this scenario. This architecture can also be expanded in future by providing SOA over the ESB.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/kBIsU.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now my concerns/questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Since Cast Iron is an orchestration tool, which one should I use for orchestrations? Is it Cast Iron or the ESB?</li>
<li>Cast Iron can only talk to JMS/IBM MQ and cannot talk to Microsoft Messsage Queue. So, should we go with java based ESB like Mule (with Active MQ) or Service Mix? </li>
<li>What are my options for .NET based ESB (other than Microsoft Biztalk and NServiceBus), which is reliable and most widely used?</li>
<li>What's the best practice on bulk data movement? Usually, this can be done through SSIS. In our case, we may have to move bulk data to cloud on periodical basis. </li>
<li>What's the best way to publish messages to JMS based message store from .NET applications? </li>
</ul>

<p>I know I have asked many questions here and may or may not have direct  answers. I would be glad to hear the views from the gurus. </p>

<p>Clients should be able to connect using different connectors like HTTP, SOAP or AMF. Incoming requests need to be converted to unified, internal messages. Next, message driven beans call the business logic and return the result of the request to the specific connector.</p>

<p>Q1: Does that sound reasonable?</p>

<p>My question is how do I store the session information for each client. That would include connection data, timestamps, commands which need to be delivered etc.
Stateful Session Beans should be fine for this, because I need them just as long as a client is connected. However, the problem is to maintain a list of all beans to be able to pick the correct session for a new request.
I cannot link the SFSB reference to a HttpSession (as recommended elsewhere) because there are different connectors, not only HTTP clients.</p>

<p>Q2: What is the correct approach for that? A session manager, which performs a JNDI lookup to create a new SFSB and adds it to an internal list?</p>

<p>Q3: How would it work in a clustered environment? I see that SFSBs can be replicated to different nodes, but how to sync the session manager list?</p>

I really don't want to use JSTL to build my forms here, because there's no data backing for them at this point. I'm using tiles to assemble the pages, so the guts of this form comes from a view, but apart from that there's nothing JSPish about it; it's just a form.</p>

<p>Inside that form, I have a text area that I've written:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;textarea id=""whatever"" name=""whatever""&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When that comes to the screen, the &lt;/textarea> tag is gone. Different browsers deal with that differently, up to and including swallowing up the whole rest of the body HTML inside the text area field.</p>

<p>So I tried putting some content inside that textarea. Spaces and line breaks don't change its behavior, but it appears that any non-space character does. If I go </p>

<pre><code>&lt;textarea&gt;.&lt;/textarea&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>... it respects my close textarea tag. But then of course my text area renders on the screen with a dot in it, which isn't what I want.</p>

<p>Is this a known issue? Am I doing something wrong?</p>

<p>EDIT: 
@bozho: Here's a pertinent chunk of my jsp:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""notes"" class=""detailPanel""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""panelLabel""&gt;Notes&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;table &gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;By&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Note&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody id=""notesBody""&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;textarea id=""newNote"" rows=""5"" cols=""80"" &gt;.&lt;/textarea&gt;
    &lt;button id=""addNewNote"" onClick=""saveNote();""&gt;Add New Note&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Absolutely nothing fancy going on here (I populate the tbody with rows on the client, is why that's empty). Without the dot in the third-to-last line, the closing textarea tag does not come out in the resulting HTML.</p>

<p>EDIT2 (Solution):</p>

<p>This URL became googlable after hearing some key words from people responding here: 
<a href=""http://www.jroller.com/komu/entry/textareas_with_jspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jroller.com/komu/entry/textareas_with_jspx</a></p>

<p>Turns out that when jspx pages are parsed, empty tags are collapsed into a single self-closing tag, which breaks text areas. The solution is to put an empty jsp:text in the middle:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;textarea&gt;&lt;jsp:text /&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>More over some configuration can't be stored in db i.e. log level needs to be applied on the logger object in each node separately. </p>

<p>I was thinking about using JMS Topics and publish/subscribe approach to achive that goal. 
The idea is that each node could subscribe to each Topic and no matter which nodes initate the config change modification would be propagated to all nodes within the cluster.</p>

<p>Has anyone ever tried to do that in WAS and whether there are any obstacles with this approach. If there are or if you have any other suggestion on how to solve that problem I would be very greatfull for your help.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I updated my post to include the steps I've done. I am using Eclipse as my IDE and the version of my Axis2 is axis2-1.6.1. My JDK version is 1.6.</p>

<p>The steps below is how I created my web service and deploy it on Tomcat. I haven't encountered any problem on running it on Tomcat.</p>

<ol>
<li>Set Axis2 Preferences. Browse the location of axis2-1.6.1. Click Ok.</li>
<li>Create Dynamic Web Project. For the mean time, I set the server to Apache Tomcat v5.5. I also modify the configuration to include Axis2 Web Services under Project Facet. Axis2 Web Services Core and Extensions are Version 1.1. Dynamic Web Module is Version 2.4. Java is Version 1.6. JavaScript is Version 1.0.</li>
<li>Create HelloName class with a hello method. The parameter of the method is the name of the person. The return type of the method is a String consisting of ""Hello, "" + the name of the person.</li>
<li>Right click on HelloWorld class. Click New > Other > web Service. Server runtime is Tomcat v5.5 Server. Web service runtime is Apache Axis2. Click Finish.</li>
</ol>

<p>The steps below is how I deployed it on WebSphere: (I am using a WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0.0.0.)</p>

<ol>
<li>Modify axis2.xml. Add parameter ""EnableChildFirstClassLoading"" to it and set its value to true. This is as instructed on the Application Server Specific Configuration Guide found at the Apache Axis2's website. I am following the guide for WebSphere since I'm using WebSphere.</li>
<li>Export project as war. Uncheck Optimize for a specific server runtime. Browse Destination. Click Finish.</li>
<li>Install war on WebSphere. Select Fast Path and accept all defaults. Set the Context Root to ""/HelloName"".</li>
<li>Modify Class loader order of the module under Manage module. Set it to Class loaded with local class loader first (parent last). This is also as instructed on the guide.</li>
<li>Click Ok. Then Save. Click Ok again. Then Save.</li>
<li>Start it.</li>
</ol>

<p>After following these steps, I am encountered the error I above. The guide I followed is located at: <a href=""http://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/docs/app_server.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/docs/app_server.html</a> . Under the WebSphere portion, it says that I must modify axis2.xml and add ""EnableChildFirstClassLoading"" parameter and set the value of it to ""true"". It also says that I must modify the application configuration to enable parent last class loading for the Web module. I did both of them but to no avail. I did not set the repository location outside of the installedApps directory since I won't be upgrading it and I'm only testing the project. I also have no plans to add any additional modules.</p>

<p>Updates:</p>

<p>It's now working. Apparently, ""EnableChildFirstClassLoading"" is already existing on axis2.xml. I didn't notice it so I added a new parameter and even though the value of my new parameter is set to true, it was overriden by the other ""EnableChildFirstClassLoading"" parameter which is set to false by default.</p>

<ul>
<li>message queue is FIFO</li>
<li>if a duplicate message is being enqueued, the message queue itself either rejects or drops it.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, producers put these three messages (each with a discriminator value) into the queue in this sequence: M1(discriminator=7654), M2(discriminator=2435), M3(discriminator=7654).
Now I want the message queue to see that M3 has the same discriminator value as M1 and thus drop/reject M3. Consumers receive only: M1, M2.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong><br>
I have created 'mq-user' linux user (mq-users group). CHLAUTH is enabled (default).
After creating the queue manager QM_TEST (using sudo mqm) I have executed the following mqsc commands again using sudo mqm:</p>

<p>stateless session bean implements this interface. Method createTimer creates timer instance from TimerService. This part of code work fine.

<li><p>create Servlet with 1 where inject SchedulerBean in init() method and call createTimer.</p></li>

<p>But this does not work, because at first webspere deploy web application, call listeners, initialize servlets, and only then deploy ejb.jar in which all ejb are located. I can see that in webshpere log file. So when I try get ejb throw @EJB annotation or lookup I get Exception, beacause ejb has not been found.
May be is other approach to start timer after deploy ejb module or change deploy order?</p>

<p>I have a problem to struggle with. Before end user receives a response from web-service, I should sign the message, that is I extract the current SOAP message and invoke signing web-service. After I'm done, I just send it up the JAX-WS handlers chain. We have used JAX-WS handlers so far. The problem is that WebSphere sometimes refuses to pick up and invoke the handler. I mean, really. I've worked every angle and this just does not work. I've come up with an idea to do the signing in the module. I know it is not a good idea but I will think of something better after the signing procedure works once and for all. The major problem is that I do not know how to inject SOAPMessageContext in the module since WebSphere do it for JAX-WS handler automatically. I have neither not found the api reference to retrieve current SOAPMessageContext with ibm api, nor am I able to set the message in any other way. Is there a light at the end of the tonnel for me?</p>

There is a requirement to not use a Application Server. So I am trying to look into some alternative options. Currently we are planning to use ActiveMQ as the JMS provider. Also the Java application needs to interact with an backend database. So, when trying to figure out options, I found that the Spring framework would be quite helpful. It appears that Spring may need some additional components (e.g, Atomikos) to provide transaction support for JMS &amp; JDBC operations.
I am trying to limit the user of additional components as much as possible.
So, Is this the right approach to use ActiveMQ with Spring. If so, can I just use the built-in transaction module available in Spring to support transactions?</p>

I've been doing some research on some of the APIs that Microsoft makes available for this purpose, and from what I've read so far (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1308585/using-msmq-system-messaging-versus-wcfg-msmq-system-messaging-versus-wcf"">Using MSMQ - System.Messaging versus WCF</a>), WCF seems to provide the preferred APIs for doing this sort of thing, since it handles many of the low-level networking details for you.</p>

<p>I was wondering, however, if there are any newer/higher-level solutions for message queuing (from Microsoft or 3rd-parties)?  I searched in ASP.Net MVC3 and .Net 4, but I didn't find anything other than the solutions already offered in WCF.</p>

<p>My project is currently using MSMQ for message queuing, but if there are any more convenient queuing solutions, I'd be glad to hear about them.</p>

<p>I understand that in a 3-tier system the database usually is the 3rd tier. Some times legacy systems are also placed on this tier because they also interact directly with the same database as the business middleware (2nd tier) and for one reason or another, they don't belong anywhere else.</p>

<p>My question is: what <em>code</em> (if any) belongs on the 3rd ""EIS"" tier? ORM code such as Hibernate classes and DAOs?</p>

<p>On the 2nd tier you have both systems and compiled Java running. For instance you might have a Tomcat server running a bunch of WARs that you wrote. I'm not ""getting"" the anology in the 3rd tier, where you have an RDBMS and (I guess?!?!) some code to interact with that RDBMS.</p>

<p>In sum, I guess I'm wondering what the standard/best practices are behind deploying code in the EIS tier, and what those deployments look like. Thanks in advance!</p>

These will mostly need to be signal processing modules for manipulating audio and video. I have been reading about implementing a custom class loader, but it seems that one must know the names of the classes in order to use the classLoader. This doesn't seem right to me. I want to be able to build these modules after the application has been deployed (and possibly open up a public api for their creation).</p>

<p>I was thinking of requiring the modules to extend an abstract class that implements an interface:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class AbstractModule implements myInterface{
    //....
}
</code></pre>

<p>I still don't have any way of knowing what the authors of these Modules will name the subclass...</p>

However I obviously dont want to redesign my entire architecture... is it possible to have this part of my application use Osgi bundles? My feeling is no, since it seems that Osgi bundles require their own container to run in.</p>

<p>Anyway, what is the best, least hacky, and most stable way to let my applcation load modules dynamically. The modules need some sort of standardization (like extending an abstract class).</p>

There should only be one instance of this timer thread.  The current solution involves calling startTimer() from the init() method of one of our servlets, where the servlet is forced to load at startup using  in the web.xml, but that feels like coincidental behaviour instead of the right way to do things.

<p>After an initial analysis made by the new team in charge, they noticed that, comparing to the other services/technologies our company has to offer - Java, C++, Objective-C, etc - COBOL was lacking ""advertisement"". He stated that whenever members of other teams are in-between projects they implement small demos which then can be shown to our clients whenever there is a presentation of our company. He gave examples of widgets for mobile devices in Objective-C, cool web-pages with HTML5, etc.
And noticed that there is nothing in COBOL like that. So he wants us to develop some kind of tool/app to show what our competences. </p>

<p>We already told him that COBOL is used under the hood, and doesn't have bells and whistles to show. Also that when hiring a COBOL programmer/analyst the most important for the client is that he shows he has ""business logic"" knowledge. </p>

<p>I know that the coding part is very important but after a two weeks introduction to the mainframe environment and to COBOL I was capable of doing my programming tasks easily. But with a 6 months experience working in a bank I find myself having to, nearly everyday, ask questions regarding ""business logic"" to the ""gurus"" just so that I don't end up changing the logic of the process when performing some maintenance task. </p>

<p>Can we really make something (tool/app) that shows or future clients that we have something different to offer than all the other company's which provide the same services? Or if not, is there anything that we can say to our manager so that he understands that COBOL is different from the other languages and it's purpose is not to display pretty graphics on the screen.</p>

<p>Over the years I've heard little bits and pieces about it, and even took a software engineering course that covered some EJB. However, I realize I still know almost nothing about it and what it's used for.</p>

<p>So, I have two questions really: first, if I'm designing a web application server, what kinds of requirements would lead me to pick Java EE versus Java SE? Does it largely depend on the application I want to deploy, or are there fundamental aspects of Java EE that make it better for <em>any</em> application server?</p>

<p>My second question: what are some well-known Java EE applications in deployment? Are there any that are open source?</p>

<p>Thanks much.</p>

<p>The portal has a credential vault and we can successfully access the secrets for the remote web application on the server side. We are using Apache's HTTP Components utility to post the login request to the j_spring_security_check and are successfully authenticating. The response to this post sends back a 302 redirect to the application home page and sets a cookie with a session id.</p>

<p>Now we have to somehow send this authenticated session back to the browser and this is where we are having trouble. Simply redirecting the browser to the home page doesn't work - it redirects us to the login page. Forwarding all of the response headers back to the browser exactly as received on the server-side doesn't work either - still returned to the login page.</p>

<p>So, how do we authenticate server-side and still be able to load the target page client-side?</p>

<p>I am relatively new to this so I apologize if this is a silly question. Any help or advice regarding an alternative approach is appreciated.</p>

<p>As a test, we wrote a bit of a hack that seems to work, but is too insecure to be viable:</p>

<ul>
<li>Embedded a form on the jsp which will post the login credentials directly to the remote site's j_spring_security_check. </li>
<li>Wrote a servlet method to retrieve the credentials from the vault. </li>
<li>Filled the credentials on the client side into hidden form fields and submitted the form via javascript.</li>
</ul>

I'm using Hibernate+Struts2+Tomcat6+Mysql as my J2EE framework. I've been using hibernate's built-in connection pooling mechanism but it turned out to be problematic where mysql closes it's connections after 8 hours. Anyway I googled around a little bit and found that I should get my connections through JNDI datasource but I couldn't reach a good and complete tutorial on this. What steps should I take to do so? please provide me enough of details, I'm kinda new on this.
here is my hibernate.cfg.xml</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE hibernate-configuration PUBLIC ""-//Hibernate/Hibernate Configuration DTD 3.0//EN"" ""http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-configuration-3.0.dtd""&gt;

    &lt;property name=""show_sql""&gt;true&lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name=""dialect""&gt;org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect&lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name=""current_session_context_class""&gt;thread&lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name=""cache.provider_class""&gt;org.hibernate.cache.NoCacheProvider&lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name=""hbm2ddl.auto""&gt;update&lt;/property&gt;

    &lt;property name=""hibernate.max_fetch_depth""&gt;3&lt;/property&gt;

      &lt;!-- Mapping files --&gt;

      &lt;mapping resource=""com/hposg/hibernate/resources/Player.hbm.xml""/&gt;
      &lt;mapping resource=""com/hposg/hibernate/resources/Game.hbm.xml""/&gt;
      ...

  &lt;/session-factory&gt;
&lt;/hibernate-configuration&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I also tried this but it didn't work out:
Creating a context.xml in WebContent/META-INF containing:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Context path="""" docBase=""../RSGames"" debug=""0"" reloadable=""true""&gt;
    &lt;Resource name=""jdbc/RSGames"" auth=""Container"" type=""javax.sql.DataSource""
         username=""root""
         password=""""
         driverClassName=""com.mysql.jdbc.Driver""
         url=""jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hposg?autoReconnect=true&amp;amp;useUnicode=true&amp;amp;characterEncoding=utf8""
         maxActive=""15""
         maxIdle=""7""
         validationQuery=""Select 1"" /&gt;
&lt;/Context&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>putting this in web.xml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;resource-ref&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;Connection Pool&lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;res-ref-name&gt;jdbc/RSGames&lt;/res-ref-name&gt;
    &lt;res-type&gt;javax.sql.Datasource&lt;/res-type&gt;
    &lt;res-auth&gt;Container&lt;/res-auth&gt;
&lt;/resource-ref&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and modifying hibernate config like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE hibernate-configuration PUBLIC ""-//Hibernate/Hibernate Configuration DTD 3.0//EN"" ""http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-configuration-3.0.dtd""&gt;
&lt;hibernate-configuration&gt;
  &lt;session-factory&gt;
  ...
    &lt;property name=""connection.datasource""&gt;java:comp/env/jdbc/RSGames&lt;/property&gt;
  ...
  &lt;/session-factory&gt;
&lt;/hibernate-configuration&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>as I mentioned before, it doesn't get connected to database this way. any ideas?</p>

<p>[EDIT]
When I execute the app I get this exception:</p>

Since the project has been developed in 3-tier architecture, we wanna dedicate a separated machines to each tier and connect them via GigaBit Ethenrnet connections. So we're gonna need a DB-Server(MySQL), a Logic-Server(Struts2+POJOs) and a Web-Server. </p>

<p>Tomcat is a part of the Logic-Server and it lies where POJOs and struts go, What I mean by web-server is a front end server which takes users' requests and dispatches them to the Logic-Server.
On the other hand we might wanna use more than one Logic-Server. Is it even possible?</p>

This is often caused by having a class defined at multiple

include compiling against an older or newer version of the class

<p>I'm not sure what the issue is. I was seeing this previously before defining a serial version uid and figured that by defining that and being consistent, future updates to the class file would run successfully. There are no errors during compilation or deployment to the server. Is it possible that an older version of the servlet is cached somewhere on the WebSphere instance (I am only deploying on my dev machine at the moment)?</p>

This web application should be able to query current tasks for a specific user, claim tasks not claimed previously by any other user, complete tasks and so on. This web application will be deployed on a WAS 7.0 on a different cell than the one providing the HumanTask service (Currently we are using another WPS instance as the WAS but eventually it will be a simple WAS without WPS features). We synchronized LTPA generation keys by means of following steps:</p>

<p>We developed a simple web application with GWT as a proof of concept with a simple UI and a web service client which consumes the HumanTask JAX-WS service. This web application is protected behind a Siteminder authenticator (when first entering web application Siteminder agent redirects to a web form asking for credentials). Web service client has been developed following JAX-WS standards, no additional dependencies have been added, we rely on WebSphere JAX-WS implementation (Apache Axis2). Once deployed we tested two scenarios without luck:</p>

<p><strong>Scenario A</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>By default WPS’ HumanTask service provider is attached to policy set “BPC Web Service” with default policy set binding and policy set sharing disabled.</li>
<li>We configure our HumanTask service client to use same policy set as service provider.</li>
<li><p>Log in to custom web application. When trying to query current tasks we get following exception:</p>

</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>No error message at service provider side.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario B</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Change WPS’ HumanTask service provider configuration enabling policy set sharing through HTTP GET. This way service provider WSDL contains information about the policy set.</li>
<li>Change policy set configuration at service client to obtain policy set from provider using HTTP GET.</li>
<li><p>Log in to custom web application. When trying to query current tasks we get following exception:</p>

<p>At service provider logs we can see following error:</p>

<p>And a set of FFDCs are generated reporting the same exception we got at service client side.</p>

We need to run two copies of the same WAR within the same copy of websphere, and have each copy of the app load a different properties file from the filesystem. I'm looking for something that I can set from the websphere management console while deploying the application, which is visible to the app and can be used to change how the app searches for its properties.</p>

<p>Right now the properties file is stored in the WAR so we build a different version of the WAR for each environment. Instead, we'd like to use a single, non-environment-specific WAR file with an external properties file stored in the filesystem. We have that working. However, we have two development environments hosted within the same copy of websphere. So we need to deploy two copies of the same WAR within the same websphere server and have each instance load a different properties file.</p>

<p>One thing we tried was to check the context root. When two copies of the app are deployed, they each have to have a different context root (the first part of the URL used to access the app), and the Axis2 ConfigurationContext includes a function for reading the context root. Unfortunately, when the app runs within WAS, it's getting the Axis2 idea of the context root--which is always ""axis2""--and not the real context root that WAS is using.</p>

<p>EDIT: To clarify, we want to load the properties file during application startup (during ServiceLifecycle.startup() for those of you familiar with Axis2). At that point there's no actual web service request to be processed, so we don't have a message context to examine.</p>

(eclipse)</a> but is specifically about bundling a JRE as well.</p>

<p>I am currently working on building an MSI for my product so it can be installed as an add-on with Windows Home Server. <strong>The installer must be a silent MSI installer.</strong></p>

<p>My product depends on Java 1.6. I want to bundle Java inside the MSI but not necessarily <i>install</i> the JRE, simply copying the files to my product directory and executing from there would be fine.</p>

<p>Initially I tried installing the JRE anyway as a first step. I used the <a href=""http://www.java.com/en/download/help/silent_install.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">JRE's silent installer</a>, however it turned out that because the JRE installs itself via another MSI, under the covers, the one-MSI-installation-running-at-once rule was broken, and so a JRE could not be installed.</p>

<p>So I changed to copying the JRE files instead. I have managed to create an MSI with all the items, but it comes in at a whopping 60MB! That's around 33MB for my app and the rest is the JRE. My normal setup.exe which bundles the JRE is about 30MB, so I am assuming compression is much better in the latter case (I also use Pack200 compression there).</p>

<p>I am using WiX to build the MSI and have compression turned on.</p>

<p>We have an application that is running on WAS. When we start the server, WAS sets his DataSource so that it points to the data base. Everything works fine, expect when the DBAs have to reboot the data base server. When they do, the data source is no longer valid and we have to manually restart all server and we are currently trying to correct that, if possible. We need to find a way to do it because we have 3 pre-production environnement for for our application, and there are two servers associated with it, one for the application and the other is a report generator web service. So, when the DBAs wants to reboot the server (and they usually don't tell us!) we have to reboot six servers. I was wondering if in Java, there was a way to reset the data source so that we don't need to restart the servers.</p>

<p>We have a jar file that we create as part of our build process with some common code in it and under tomcat 5 this lived under shared/lib. When we wrote log statements from code in this jar file, they were written to the log file of the web application calling the jar at that moment. Each of our webapps has a log4j.properites and log4j.jar in it's WEB-INF/lib directory, and there was also a log4j.jar in shared/lib, but not log4j/properties.</p>

<p>For some background, I've been using IBM WebSphere Application Server as my primary Java EE application server and it provides Java APIs, wsadmin commands, and a GUI wizard in the admin console which prompt deployers for the deployment information that it needs to deploy an application and generates its own custom descriptor files during deployment. I'm hoping that other application servers, in particular, JBoss 7, also provide similar functionality.</p>

<p>One of the goals is to be able to <em>automate</em> the deployment of a diverse set of portable Java EE applications (i.e. applications that will not have JBoss-specific descriptors containing deployment information), and to prevent deployers <em>manually</em> performing deployments from being intimately familiar not only with the application and module deployment descriptors, but more importantly, all of the annotations contained in the code that must be managed at deployment-time (such as <code>@Resource</code> annotations).</p>

<p>In particular, I'm looking for the fulfillment of this requirement in the <a href=""http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=316"" rel=""nofollow"">Java EE specification</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>EE.2.12.4 Deployment Descriptors and Annotations</strong></p>
  
  <p>The Java EE Product Provider is required to provide a deployment tool that interprets the Java EE deployment descriptors and class file annotations and allows the Deployer to map the application component’s requirements to the capabilities of a specific Java EE product and environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the specification is somewhat ambiguous as to what this means and how it is implemented, in my opinion, WebSphere Application Server fulfills this requirement beautifully, whereas many other application servers (such as JBoss, it seems) that require the manual creation of custom descriptors prior to deployment fall short.</p>

<p>Also note that I've posted this same question to the JBoss Community Forums (<a href=""http://community.jboss.org/message/621309#621309"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""http://community.jboss.org/thread/171141"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>), but have not received any responses there.</p>

<p>I'm hopeful but not optimistic that there can be a better way.
Some options we've considered/used, each with it's pros and cons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use multiple maven projects and continuous integration (eg. hudson or jenkins) to build a configuration jar that includes all the property files for each environment (dev, qa, prod) and then bundle everything up as an EAR. But then things can't be easily changed in production when needed.</li>
<li>Put most of the settings in the DB and have a simple screen to modify it. Internally we can have a generic configuration service EJB that can read and modify the values. Each module can have a custom extended version that have specific getters and setter.</li>
<li>Version control all the property files then check it out on production and check it into a production branch after making changes.</li>

In the past, developers have had more or less free reign to access UAT environments, and even wide latitude to access production.  </p>

<p>However, under the new approach, developers have access only to the Dev and initial QA environments... and are locked out of UAT and production.  All access to those environments, from deploying code (Java WAR's in this case), to managing Java app servers, to even reviewing logs and the database, has to funnel through a sysadmin.</p>

<p>It's still early on, but so far this approach does not appear tenable.  The net result is that every time there is a production issue, <strong><em>or even just a bug ticket entered in UAT</em></strong>... it requires an ""all hands"" meeting, with half the department crammed into someone's office or huddled around one person's monitor.</p>

<p>I would like to propose something more workable, while still satisfying the need to restrict access to sensitive user data, etc.  One idea that comes to mind is to create a readonly-mount for the log file directory, at some other location where developers may at least view the application-level logs.  However, beyond that I am interested in best practices for how to restrict developer access while taking the smallest productivity hit possible.</p>

<p>I am using Jquery &amp; Jquery forms to auto-save user data at a set interval. I still want the application to be able to time out, but the auto-saves via jquery forms keep refreshing the server.</p>

<p>My initial idea to fix this was pretty simple. I've already got an ActionFilter I use to see if the session expires. Well, the session won't ever expire; however, I just keep track of how many auto saves occurr based on a value in session and when it reaches a limit (specified in the web.config), it does a:</p>

<pre><code> filterContext.Result = new RedirectResult(""~/Account.aspx/LogOn"");
</code></pre>

<p>Well, this doesn't work because the auto save is doing an ajaxFormSubmit to call the action in the first place. I've tried changing the action to redirect to the login page, but the same thing happens....it just doesn't do a redirect. The only thing the action can return is a Json result. In my latest version (code below) I'm setting the json return value to false and calling a redirectToLogin() function to send the page over to the login page. It doesn't work and i'm not sure why.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on this would be most helpful.</p>

    double maxContiguousAutoSaves = double.Parse(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[""MAX_CONTIGUOUS_AUTO_SAVES""].ToString());           
    double autoSaveInterval = (sessionTimeoutInMinutes / maxContiguousAutoSaves) * 60 * 1000;

I am not able to understand the difference between why it works when deployed as an enterprise application from admin console.</p>

<p>I have uninstalled the server assuming something might have corrupted the server. But it did not help at all.</p>

<p>Is this a known problem?
Please help.</p>

<p>Thanks,

<p>We are hosting the Webservice in Websphere 7 - the external webservice is essentially a proxy to the real WS running on our ESB platform.</p>

<p>Currently I have the following security in place:</p>

<p>1) WS-Security username/password sent in the header (plantext). This is authenticated against our custom repository (the repository is in-use elsewhere and has been security tested).</p>

<p>2) HTTPS</p>

<p>3) Restricting calling IPs via firewall</p>

<p>4) Payload data is PGP encrypted using the clients public key</p>

<p>Is this secure ""enough""? I'm pretty sure the payload data is secure, but I'm not completely sure if the access mechanism is 100% secure? We are using what is built-in to IBM Websphere for #1.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Process process = Runtime.getRuntime (). Exec (JAVA_HOME ANT_HOME -jar
  / lib / ant-launcher.jar-BuildFile file.xml);</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This method, despite its apparent simplicity, but it poses several problems and is described in the javadoc as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because Some native platforms Provide only limited buffer size for
  standard input and output streams, failure to promptly write the input
  stream or read the output stream of the subprocess May cause the
  subprocess to block, and Even deadlock.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To solve this problem I referred to the following article:
<a href=""http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-2000/jw-1229-traps.html?page=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-2000/jw-1229-traps.html?page=1</a>
This method worked for unemachine (64-bit Windows 7, Core 2 Quad Q9400 @ 2,66 GHz 2.67 GHz, 4GB)
But when I used another machine (XP SP3, Core 2 Duo 2.99 GHz @ 3 GHz, 3.21 GB memory), the process hangs at generating the data schema and the console remains desperately silent after posted the following message: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Are you faced with a problem like this? Do you have a solution for me?

<li>MD<strong>P</strong>s (Message Driven POJO) connect via Connection Factory. </li>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/KTZiV.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>To me, <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/0504_barcia/0504_barcia.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this explanation from IBM</a> does not shed much light on the difference:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Connection factory</strong> -- used by the application to get connections to the messaging bus.</li>
<li><strong>Queue</strong> -- used by the application to send and receive messages.</li>
<li><strong>Activation specification</strong> -- used by the application's message-driven bean to connect to the queue and receive messages.</li>
</ul>

<p>One real <a href=""http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gipko.html"" rel=""nofollow"">difference I have found is that</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Session beans and entity beans [aka MDPs] allow you to send JMS messages and to
  receive them <strong>synchronously, but not asynchronously</strong>. To avoid tying up
  server resources, you may prefer not to use blocking synchronous
  receives in a server-side component. <strong>To receive messages
  asynchronously, use a message-driven bean</strong> [MDB].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the unsatisfying list I have so far is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use ActivationSpec with an MDB and ConnectionFactory with a POJO (but wait, can POJOs <a href=""http://blog.xebia.com/2009/09/spring-jms-and-websphere/"" rel=""nofollow"">use ActivationSpec too</a> ?)</li>
<li>MDB's operate asynchronously. MBP's operate synchronously.</li>
</ul>

<p>My question is: Are there other differences? Can you clarify the difference ?</p>

<p>However when I deploy that war file to Tomcat 7.0 and then copy the axis2 jars to the WEB-INF\lib folder.</p>

<p>When I restart Tomcat, the WebService does not work.</p>

<p>What I am curious is, how come Websphere7, deploys the WebService on startup without any entires in web.xml but Tomcat refuses to do so ?</p>

<p>What am I missing ?</p>

<p>This works exactly as expected in Tomcat 6.0.33 and Glassfish 3.1.1. When I migrated the same app to Websphere 7.0.0.17, I noticed that I had to reverse the classloader order marking it as PARENT_LAST (because WAS embeds a really old version of commons-logging which breaks the webapp). </p>

<p>The behavior I expect is for WAS to redirect to the form-login-page when I request a resource in the webapp.</p>

<p>The behavior I'm seeing is that instead of websphere protecting the secured resources by presenting the login form, it proceeds directly to the ""Access Denied"" supplied by spring security from within the app. </p>

<p>I've also tried BASIC instead of FORM as the auth-method, and the results are the same.</p>

<p>Any ideas as to what I might be doing wrong?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Disabling Spring Security causes the declarative security to work as expected.
This sort of leads to the conclusion that if I want the built-in LoginFilter to fire first, I'd have to explicitly declare it in my web.xml --giving me a dependency on WAS :O(</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I also discovered that WAS fires the filters declared in the app <em>before</em> applying declarative security; it happens this way regardless of the classloader order.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: I have administrative security enabled, and properly mapped user roles, etc. I verified this using the ""DefaultApp"" that comes with websphere, the ""snoop"" servlet is protected, and the challenge seems to work as normal in that app.</p>

AFAIK, this method is used to roll back all operations to JMS server (sending/receiving) by the session when using *SESSION_TRANSACTED* acknowledge mode. Now suppose I am calling this method in a catch block of a receiving/processing operation (is reasonable?), to tell JMS server to redeliver the message for processing, But even if it is redelivered the processing still throws the same exception which cause the JMS server to redeliver the message again, so it seems a infinite process.

"8093932","1","8094098","","2011-11-11 12:22:54","2","1102","<p>For my project i want to implement a combobox with <strong>h:selectOneMenu</strong>. I read many posts about how to handle the selectOneMenu properly and how to implement a custom converter. The combobox shall store the ID (<strong>Long</strong>) from a different DB Table (named fk_ID) for which a constrain is in place. So far everything seems to function as planned. Now to my problem:</p>

<p>The column fk_ID is optional, so the first option in the combobox is a <strong>f:selectItem</strong> with no value labeled ""choose ..."". When I save the form and change the value everything is OK, except if I set it back to ""choose ..."". The error I get is a <strong>constraint integrity violation</strong>.</p>

<p>I found the problem too: The converter returns <strong>null</strong> as intended but the bean receives the <strong>Long 0</strong>.</p>

<p>The XHTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h:selectOneMenu value=""#{userBean.selectedModel.fk_id}""
    id=""combobox""&gt;
    &lt;f:selectItem itemLabel=""choose ..."" /&gt;
    &lt;f:selectItems
        value=""#{userBean.items}""
        var=""item""
        itemLabel=""#{item.value}""
        itemValue=""#{item.id}""
    /&gt;
    &lt;f:converter converterId=""userConverter"" /&gt;
&lt;/h:selectOneMenu&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The custom converter:</p>

<pre><code>@FacesConverter(value = ""userConverter"")
public class UserConverter implements Converter {
    @Override
    public Object getAsObject(FacesContext arg0, UIComponent arg1, String arg2) {
        if (arg2 != null &amp;&amp; !arg2.equals(""null""))
            return Long.valueOf(arg2);

        return null;
    }
    @Override
    public String getAsString(FacesContext arg0, UIComponent arg1, Object arg2) {
        return String.valueOf(arg2);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The bean (very short version):</p>

<pre><code>@Named(value = ""userBean"")
public class UserController implements Serializable {

    @Getter
    @Setter
    private UserModel selectedModel;

    @Getter
    @Setter
    private List&lt;UserModel&gt; items;

    public void saveModel() {
        selectedModel = userService.saveModel(selectedModel);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that the <strong>fk_id</strong> is <strong>Long 0</strong>, but should be <strong>null</strong>. I can solve the problem by writing</p>

<pre><code>if (selectedModel.getFk_id() == 0)
    selectedModel.setFk_id(null);
</code></pre>

<p>, but thats not a solution I am comfortable with.</p>

<p>My Question: Why is the value <strong>null</strong>, which the converter returns, the <strong>Long 0</strong> inside the <strong>saveModel()</strong> method?</p>

<p>There is something I am not sure to understand with an ESB. I know it is rather a concept describing the network of an enterprise as a bus and not really a concrete thing, but still.</p>

<p>I can understand that an ESB provides protocol and message conversions with legacy services, allows orchestration and that the logic of the message destination is done by the ESB. But I also thought of the ESB as a middleware between different ESB servers (and not only with web service interfaces). </p>

<p>If I take the example of ServiceMix, I thought that it would be natural to have several ServiceMix platforms on different servers which interact through a common bus/protocol (NMR? JMS?). Therefore my service on ServiceMix (a) created with CAMEL (by using some web services for instance) could consume a service on ServiceMix (b) also created with CAMEL.</p>

<p>So if my service need another service, I would just mention its identifier, and the ESB would route my request to the correct ServiceMix platform.</p>

<p>But when I read about the examples of ServiceMix, it seems to me that ServiceMix is prefentially used as a standalone application server. Not a cluster of servers.</p>

<p>Is an ESB simply a boosted application server? (let apart the integration capabilities it provides)</p>

<p>Is there actually multiple ESBs in an SOA? Are they linked with a protocol internal to the ESB? Or do the services implemented on an ESB (a) must provide external interfaces like SOAP so an ESB (b) can use its services? </p>

I found a <a href=""http://s.sudre.free.fr/Stuff/Ivanhoe/FLAT.html"" rel=""nofollow"">website</a> that details the contents of a flat package but it seems like a bit of a project to start from scratch. Anyone have any experience building PKGs? Does anyone know of any libraries to aid in the process?</p>

<p>EDIT: 
It seems I may not have been clear in my request. My goal is to have users go to a website that requires them to enter some information. After they've entered their information my code would create a PKG for them that contains some information about them. For example, maybe the postinsall script would run the command ""say 'Hello USERNAME_THEY_ENTERED'"". Silly example but it's the general idea. The user would then be able to run the PKG and the install that takes place would be customized with their information.</p>

<p>Here is a simple web app and JMeter test that I think demonstrates the cause of this problem. The web app consists of two classes, the following servlet:</p>

<pre><code>public class SessionTestServlet extends HttpServlet {

    protected static final String SESSION_KEY = ""session_key"";

    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        // set data on session so the listener is invoked
        String sessionData = new String(""Session data"");
        request.getSession().setAttribute(SESSION_KEY, sessionData);
        PrintWriter writer = response.getWriter();                           
        writer.println(""&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;OK&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"");                      
        writer.flush();
        writer.close();
    }
}

<p>and the following implementation of HttpSessionListener and HTTPSessionAttributeListener:</p>

<pre><code>public class SessionTestListener implements 
        HttpSessionListener, HttpSessionAttributeListener {

    private static final ConcurrentMap&lt;String, HttpSession&gt; allSessions 
        = new ConcurrentHashMap&lt;String, HttpSession&gt;(); 

    public void attributeRemoved(HttpSessionBindingEvent hsbe) {}

    public void attributeAdded(HttpSessionBindingEvent hsbe) {
        System.out.println(""Attribute added, "" + hsbe.getName() 
            + ""="" + hsbe.getValue());

        int count = 0;
        for (HttpSession session : allSessions.values()) {
            if (session.getAttribute(SessionTestServlet.SESSION_KEY) != null) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(count + "" of "" + allSessions.size() 
            + "" sessions have attribute set."");
    }

    public void attributeReplaced(HttpSessionBindingEvent hsbe) {}

<p>It appears that when a thread (T1) executing the servlet's doGet() method calls setAttribute() on the instance of HttpSession implementation (S1), it locks on the monitor of S1. While holding that lock it goes into the iteration of allSessions inside the listener's attributeAdded() method and calls getAttribute(). It looks like inside getAttribute(), WebSphere locks on that instance's monitor (possibly because it is setting a lastUpdateTime field?). So, T1 will in turn lock the monitors of S1, S2, S3, S4, S5... all the while holding the lock on S1 from the setAttribute() call in the servlet.</p>

<p>So if at the same time another thread (T2) is locking on another session (S2)'s monitor in the servlet and then goes into the loop in addAttribute(), the threads deadlock on the S1 and S2 monitors.</p>

<p>I have been unable to find anything explicit in the J2EE specs about this but this part of the Servlet 2.4 spec implies that the container should not be synchronizing on instances of HttpSession implementations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>SRV.7.7.1 Threading Issues</strong></p>
  
  <p>Multiple servlets executing request threads may have active access to
  a single session object at the same time. The Developer has the
  responsibility for synchronizing access to session resources as
  appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>JBoss does not show any deadlocks when we run the test against it. So my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is my understanding correct?</li>
<li>If so, is this a bug or contravention of the J2EE spec in WebSphere?</li>
<li>If not, and it is valid behaviour that the developer should know about and code around, is this behaviour documented anywhere?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I consume a Web service methods exposed by an institution outside the mine, the web service was generated by JAX WS-SUN.
Implement other web service for domestic consumption of my institution which encapsulates the methods exposed by the outsourcer, use JAX WS-SUN (not IBM), initially had some problems with the recognition of some jar.
Try setting the shared libraries on the server to use the jar with the class loader PARENT_LAST and did not work.
Try reliza with JAX WS-IBM libraries but had no success, so do so with JAX WS-SUN (libraries used by the external service provider)
Then I found a solution using the ""endorsed"" folder (this folder already existed but was empty) that is in the sdk directory tree included in the WAS 7.0 and copying other jar in the ""classes"" folder, which are physically located (in my PC):</p>

<pre><code>endorsed: E: \ IBM \ SDP \ jdk \ jre \ lib \ Endorsed
jar copied: 
- saaj-api.jar
- Saaj-impl.jar
- Serializer-2.7.1.jar
- Stax-1.2.0.jar
- Stax-ex.jar
- Streambuffer.jar
- Xalan-2.7.1.jar
- XercesImpl-2.9.0.jar
- Xml-apis-1.3.04.jar

classes: E: \ IBM \ SDP \ runtimes \ base_v7 \ profiles \ AppSrv01 \ classes
jar copied: 
- jaxb-api.jar
- Jaxb-impl.jar
- Jaxb-xjc.jar
- Jaxp-ri-1.4.2.jar
- Jaxws-api.jar
- Jaxws-rt.jar
- Jaxws-tools.jar
- Webservices-api.jar
- Webservices-rt.jar
</code></pre>

<p>To deploy the application using the WAS 7.0 that is included in the RSA 7.5 (Rational Software Architect) which is installed on Windows Server 2003 EE - 32bit. So far so good, do my test query exposed methods and get the expected response</p>

<p><strong>THE PROBLEM:</strong></p>

<p>The problem arises when I deploy the EAR to WAS 7.0 that is installed on linux (RedHat) kernel 2.6.18 - 64 bits.</p>

<p>In this case I had to create the folder it was not endorsed directory and put the jar in each directory listed above, which are physically located in:</p>

<pre><code>Endorsed: / opt / IBM / WebSphere / AppServer / java / jre / lib / endorsed
classes: / opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/AppSrv01/classes

<p>Then I do my tests and trace gives the following error:</p>

<p>In weblogic I get the output like:</p>

<pre><code>Param value from web.xml ==&gt;&gt;  ${habilitar.debug}

<p>As noticed weblogic DOES NOT parse the value of the varible set in web.xml</p>

<p>There's a service which provides detailed information about Foos depending on their identifier.</p>

<pre><code>public FooResponse getFoo(FooRequest request){...};
</code></pre>

<p>Somewhere under the surface is a self written pool which holds recently provided response objects. For every request, the pool is asked, if there's an entry available. If yes, then it's used as the response and if not, then the database will be asked. When a response was fetched from the database, then it's stored in the pool.</p>

<p>The pool uses two strategies to take care of its size.
First, it uses <code>java.lang.ref.SoftReference&lt;T&gt;</code> inside a <code>Map</code> to avoid <code>OutOfMemoryError</code>s.
The second thing it uses is a <code>java.util.TimerTask</code> which is created for every entry in the <code>Map</code> and scheduled by a <code>java.util.Timer</code>, which deletes the entry after a configurable amount of time.</p>

<p>This is, in my opinion, violating the restriction, that an EJB is not allowed to create threads (which the <code>java.util.Timer</code> does). Am I right or am I missing something somewhere?
Until today, this has not caused any obvious problems. Do you recommend, to get rid of this self coded pool?</p>

<p>Another thing is, that the service is a stateless SessionBean. A container will create not just only one of them. Therefore they're not sharing the same pool and it would be luck, if one bean would be asked about a <code>Foo</code> twice. Am I also right with this?</p>

Now I know that this is against the original idea of the whole JCA idea but unfortunately I cannot change this design as quickly as I'd like/have to.
The data I need to get to the RA is </p>

<ul>
<li>the port it's supposed to listen on,</li>
<li>the license used for the whole application (the feature the RA supplies requires extra licensing)</li>
<li>additional configuration data stored in a db</li>
</ul>

<p>I've come up with four ideas:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use the asadmin create-resource-adapter-config. Due to the fact that glassfish doesn't seem to restart apps depending on the RA, we need to restart the application after this. While this attempt is suitable for the port, it won't fit for the other data.</li>
<li><p>Use administered objects to give my application a means to pass data in to the RA. This idea is mentioned <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2449253/get-reference-to-the-ejb3-local-business-interface-inside-the-jca-adapter/2449632#2449632"">here</a>. I guess this does it, but the spec states in chapter 13.4.2.3 that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note, administered objects are not used for setting up asynchronous message
  deliveries to message endpoints. The ActivationSpec JavaBean is used to hold all
  the necessary activation information needed for asynchronous message delivery
  setup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I cannot get any dynamic data to the ActivationSpec object (neither through a DeploymentDescriptor nor through annotations). Or did I miss something here? :-)</p></li>
<li><p>Use JDBC directly to access the data (also grabbed the idea from <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2449253/get-reference-to-the-ejb3-local-business-interface-inside-the-jca-adapter/2449632#2449632"">here</a>). While this is presumably the best idea, it does not work for the mentioned licensing data as it is not stored in the db.</p></li>
<li><p>The last idea I had was to put a method in the MessageDrivenBean (through my interface) that is used to fetch data from within the RA. That method could be called from the RA and would supply the data. But: I just think that is quite abusive as it couples the RA to the app.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Dear community, what are your thoughts on this one? I'm afraid it's not so easy to find answers to these questions, so I'd be quite happy about opinions!</p>

I'm now trying to see the ""big picture"" here and put all the theory behind JMS into a practical context where real enterprise technologies are used.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/rHiS4.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So here we have four elements: (1) <strong>JMS</strong> - a Java API for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Oriented_Middleware"" rel=""nofollow"">MOM</a>, (2) <strong>ActiveMQ</strong> - one of the many JMS implementations, (3) <strong>EIP</strong> - an intriguing and mysterious beast I am only beginning to understand, and finally, (4) <strong>Apache Camel</strong>, an open source implementation of that beast.</p>

<p>I am trying to now relate these components together to see JMS (and, in general, enterprise-class messaging) in action.</p>

<p>I guess the first thing I'm looking for is a simple and concise definition for what EIPs are. They seem to be a whole set of design patterns for how MOMs should behave, but since I'm already fuzzy on the concept of messaging to begin with, this is just a fuzzier definition being added on top of an already-fuzzy understanding of some pretty hardcore concepts.</p>

<p>Even if I don't ""get"" what EIPs are, I do ""get"" that frameworks like Camel, Mule and ServiceMix implement them and allow server-side components (""endpoints"") to message each other efficiently.</p>

<p>Most important to this question is my understanding of how these four components relate to one another. I think understanding this will help me connect most of the dots; well, the important ones anyway.</p>

<p>So in the diagram above I labeled all 6 possible relationships and refer to them below:</p>

<ol>
<li>JMS:ActiveMQ - I understand ActiveMQ to be an implementation of JMS, much like Hibernate is an implementation of JPA. Is this correct?</li>
<li>ActiveMQ:Camel - Camel has the ability to push messages to any JMS implementation, such as ActiveMQ. In this case ActiveMQ is a camel endpoint. Correct?</li>
<li>EIP:Camel - Camel is an implementation of EIPs. Understanding what EIPs are in the first place is also important to my understanding of this entire setup.</li>
<li>EIP:JMS - Although there may not be a direct connection between these two, it seems as though messaging is at the core of EIP, and JMS is Java's foundation for messaging. Is this a fair assessment?</li>
<li>I left relations between EIP:ActiveMQ and JMS:Camel in case there are any ""big concepts"" that I should be aware of between these systems.</li>
</ol>

<p>Any help in putting a simple-to-understand definition to EIP and in understanding how all these components relate to each other is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!</p>

<li>Applet</li>
<li>Java program (myapp.jar)</li>
<li>JNI library (myjni.so)</li>

<p>Please note that JNI library is built for 32 bit.   On 32 bit OS, applet uses <code>java.home</code> property to get the JRE path. Once applet gets  JRE path, it launches JAR like this </p>

<pre><code>JRE-path myapp.jar
</code></pre>

<p>Now I need to run this application on 64 bit Linux.  Here I have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Build JNI library for 64 bit. 
This is not possible as all depended libraries needs to build for 64 bit. ( This is a constraint at my end)  </li>
<li>Ask users to install 32 bit JVM
Now problem is how to get the 32 bit JRE path as <code>java.home</code> property gives the 64 bit JRE path. ( Because browser and plugins are 64 bit).  One option is to use <code>update-alternatives –list java</code> command to get all JRE installations path.   Then for each installation path, run <code>JRE-path -d32 –version</code> command to see whether it supports 32 bit JVM<br>
<ul>
<li>If it supports 32 bit JVM, use that JRE path to launch JAR file  </li>
<li>If none of the java installations support 32 bit JVM, show message to install 32 bit JVM  </li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Question:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Is there any problem for above mentioned solution? (I need to use this solution on Ubuntu, Redhat and OpenSuse)    </li>

<p><strong>JDK:</strong> stands for <strong>Java Development Kit</strong> can be know as the most basic of Java, use to develop client side application (such as desktop application (use Swing, awt, ...) or Applet,...)</p>

<p><strong>J2EE:</strong> stands for <strong>Java Enterprise Edition</strong> use to develop application on Server side (such as Servlet, EJB,...)</p>

<p>Here some answer that I have search:</p>

<p>JDK is like J2SEE !!! Oh, I don't trust this so much. when I config Glassfish server on Eclipse, Eclipse warns that this version need j2se 1.4 later (but I have JDK 7 or jdk 1.7 !!!)</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2013958/correlation-between-jee-j2ee-to-j2se-jdk-versions"">correlation-between-jee-j2ee-to-j2se-jdk-versions</a> I don't under stand phrase <code>will be built</code>(the post that have marked correct answer).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>J2EE 1.4 is the Enterprise Edition of version 1.4 of the Java
  platform, and thus will be built on J2SE 1.4.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it means J2EE is the ""beta version"" of J2SE ??!! Please explain for me.</p>

<p>By ""queue-like-thing"" I mean supports the following operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>append(entry:Entry) - add entry to tail of queue  </li>
<li>take(): Entry - remove entry from head of queue and return it</li>
<li>promote(entry_id) - move the entry one position closer to the head; the entry that currently occupies that position is moved in the old position</li>
<li>demote(entry_id) - the opposite of promote(entry_id)</li>
</ul>

<p>Optional operations would be something like:</p>

<ul>
<li>promote(entry_id, amount) - like promote(entry_id) except you specify the number of positions</li>
<li>demote(entry_id, amount) - opposite of promote(entry_id, amount)</li>
<li>of course, if we allow amount to be positive or negative, we can consolidate the promote/demote methods with a single move(entry_id, amount) method</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be ideal if the following operations could be performed on the queue in a distributed fashion (multiple clients interacting with the queue):</p>

<pre><code>queue = ...

queue.append( a )
queue.append( b )
queue.append( c )

print queue
""a b c""

queue.promote( b.id )
print queue
""b a c""

queue.demote( a.id )
""b c a""

x = queue.take()
print x
""b""
print queue
""c a""
</code></pre>

<p>Are there any data stores that are particularly apt for this use case? The queue should always be in a consistent state even if multiple users are modifying the queue simultaneously.</p>

<p>If it weren't for the promote/demote/move requirement, there wouldn't be much of a problem.</p>

<p>Edit:
Bonus points if there are Java and/or Python libraries to accomplish the task outlined above.</p>

<h1>The code (domain objects, repository classes, configuration)</h1>

<p>Here is the stack of technologies i'm using (from DB to business logic tier). I use JDK6.</p>

<p>I've two domain classes, mapped in a one-to-many fashion. A <code>DocumentVersion</code> has many <code>DocumentData</code>, each of one can represent different binary content for the same <code>DocumentVersion</code>.</p>

}
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong><em>same code</em></strong> works against a PostreSQL 9 installation. The images is being written in the database. 
Debugging my code, i've been able to find that the PostgreSQL jdbc drivers writes on the database using a buffered output stream....while the Oracle OJDBC driver tries to allocate all at once all the <code>byte[]</code>representing the image.</p>

<p>From the error stack:</p>

<pre><code>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
at java.util.Arrays.copyOf(Arrays.java:2786)
at java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream.toByteArray(ByteArrayOutputStream.java:133)
</code></pre>

<p>Is the error due to this behavior?
Can anyone give me some insights on this problem?</p>

<p>Thanks everyone.</p>

<h1>Memory Tests with JConsole</h1>

<p>Thanks to the suggestions received for my question, i've tried to do some simple tests to show memory usage of my code using two different jdbc drivers, one for PostgreSQL and one for Oracle.
Test setup:</p>

<ol>
<li>The test has been conducted using the JUnit test described in the previous section.</li>
<li>JVM Heap Size has been set to 512MB, using parameter <em>-Xmx512MB</em></li>
<li>For Oracle database, I've used <em>ojdbc6.jar</em> driver</li>
<li>For Postgres database, I've used <em>9.0-801.jdbc3 driver</em> (via Maven)</li>
</ol>

<h3>First test, with a file of approx 150MB</h3>

<p>In this first test, both Oracle and Postgres <strong><em>passed</em></strong> the test (this is BIG news).
The file is sized 1/3 of available JVM heap size.
Here the picture of JVM memory consumption:</p>

<p>Testing Oracle, 512MB Heap Size, 150MB file
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/xUvA1.png"" alt=""Testing Oracle, 512MB Heap Size, 150MB file""></p>

<p>Testing PostgreSQL, 512MB Heap Size, 150MB file
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/wXS76.png"" alt=""Testing PostgreSQL, 512MB Heap Size, 150MB file""></p>

<h3>Second test, with a file of approx 485MB</h3>

<p>In this second test, only Postgres passed the test and Oracle <strong><em>failed</em></strong> it .
The file is sized very near the size of the available JVM heap space.
Here the picture of JVM memory consumption:</p>

<p>Testing Oracle, 512MB Heap Size, 485MB file
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/81FMO.png"" alt=""Testing Oracle, 512MB Heap Size, 485MB file""></p>

<p>Testing PostgreSQL, 512MB Heap Size, 485MB file
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/U9uKb.png"" alt=""Testing PostgreSQL, 512MB Heap Size, 485MB file""></p>

<h3>Analysis of the tests:</h3>

<p>It seems that PostgreSQL driver handles memory without surpassing a certain threshold, while Oracle driver behaves very differently.</p>

<p>I can't honestly explain why Oracle jdbc driver leads me to error (the same <code>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space</code>) when using file sized near the available heap space.</p>

<p>Is there anyone that can give me more insights?
Thanks a lot for you help :)</p>

with Spring and is running in Websphere Application Server 8. </p>

<p>The problem is that this thread keeps running even if the application has been stopped. That thread needs to be stopped too but it is not happening. I even tried to use  <code>Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()</code> to check if the current thread was interrupted but it always returns <code>false</code>. So there is no way to know through my code if the Thread should keep running or stop.</p>

<p>This is my spring configuration for the WorkManagerTaskExecutor:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id=""taskExecutor"" class=""org.springframework.scheduling.commonj.WorkManagerTaskExecutor""&gt;

<ul>
<li>What am I missing? </li>
<li>What can I do so that whenever the application is stopped the application's thread (threads that were generated by the application) stops too?</li>
</ul>

<p>I think this is not considered an unmanaged thread because I am registering the thread using the appropriate <a href=""http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.express.doc/info/exp/ae/cspr_design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">WorkManager</a> which the container exposes as a resource by JNDI.</p>

<p>I have tried to comment out the code which calls processStoreSalesFile() and we didn't get this error and it is able to fetch the next ResultSet without throwing any exceptions.</p>

<p>The next attempt I tried is to uncomment the call to the method processStoreSalesFile() and then remove any ascii files from the file system so that the program will have nothing to process. And no exceptions thrown also.</p>

<p>Our setup is WebSphere-Informix. We have another setup WebSphere-Oracle and that didn't have any problems.</p>

<p>The thing I am suspecting is the ResultSet has timedout or it just didn't want to wait for the process to finish and closed by itself.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong>
Inside the processStoreSalesFile() method, there's a conn.commit() call to commit the records. Is it when a commit is called, the ResultSet will be closed? At the WAS admin console, I've already added the data source property resultSetHoldability with the value '1'. But still the ResultSet is closed.</p>

<p>I hope someone can help me here :(</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>When I download the SDK, it tries to install lots of crap I don't want. So I did some reading and realized that actually the Java SDK is a set of tools technically unrelated to the JDK. So what I am looking for is a clean simple standalone download of the JDK only.</p>

<p>We know that ""Java SE JDK"" has always been <a href=""http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">available</a> from Sun's (now Oracle) website. However, I am developing a web application and interested in <em>some</em> of the Java EE features: javax.servlet, javax.validation, javax.persistence and javax.transaction. So in effect what I'm really looking for is a ""Java EE JDK"".</p>

<p>I'm using a typical Maven / Tomcat / Spring / Hibernate setup and in the past I've always added API-only dependencies in provided scope in Maven to my project for these parts of the Java EE specification, i.e:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;javax.servlet&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;servlet-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.5&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So if I do this for all the Java EE APIs that my project requires, then I am actually using Java SE JDK with some additional manually-declared Java EE components. Furthermore when I direct my IDE to use the JDK that came with the Java EE SDK installation, these additional namespaces aren't available.</p>

<p>In other words, for all intents and purposes it would appear that the JDK that comes with the Java EE SDK download is equivalent to the JDK that I get when I install the ""Java SE JDK""... If this is correct then there is no need for me to install the Java EE SDK and I can simply use the Java (SE) JDK declaring any Java EE components that I need as *-api/provided dependencies the way I described above.</p>

<p>So my questions is: is what I describe above the right way to go, or is there such a thing as a ""Java EE JDK""? i.e a JDK that comes with the unimplemented interfaces of things like javax.servlet and javax.resources and so on? And if such a beast exists, where would I download it from?</p>

<h2>info update</h2>

<p>I wanted to mention a few things as an update to my question if it's not to late: I have about 50 headers/columns (example: First Name, Middle Name, Street1, Street2,..). So what i always need do every time a client gives me his excel file (contacts backup) is manually copy data for each of his column to the one on my side. And the problem is, every client has different column names, and also some of the columns of the client can go to multiple columns on my side. </p>

<p>So i think, if i can't find a solution, i would make a c++/qt app, which takes an excell and lets me to assign (dragdrop,etc..) every column of his side to on or more columns of my side. </p>

<p>I haven't done any vb programming, so if you can be a bit more detailed about how to aproach the solution i vb that would be great.</p>

<p>Suppose the system is in a EJB or Spring container. The system is message driven (perhaps EJB3.1).

<p>I think what I'm describing is a Strategy Pattern. Can these POJOs be generated from a set of human-readable and editable rules? Is a rule engine like <a href=""http://www.jboss.org/drools"" rel=""nofollow"">Drools</a> the right way to approach this problem?</p>

However, not all classes from the lib folder of Axis2 are being copied. Interestingly, the web service runs without any problem when deployed to Tomcat via Eclipse even if some the jars from Axis2 were not copied. Also, when I viewed the temp file of Tomcat, Tomcat seems to generate the jars for the listed modules on modules.list of the web service.</p>

<p>My web service is already running in Axis2. My class loading policy is set to PARENT_LAST. I know that since WebSphere has its own Axis2 configuration, the class loading policy must be set to PARENT_LAST so that WebSphere will use the Axis2 from the project itself.

I have been on a bunch of forums looking for better information on the subject but I haven't seen anything detailed on the subject.  So here is my situation.</p>

<p>My application uses multiple threads which were being handled by ThreadPoolTaskExecutor which a friend told me he thought would not be the correct choice since we are using websphere 7.0 application server.  I had everything working correctly and with some minor tweaking was able to replace the ThreadPoolTaskExecutor with a WorkManagerTaskExecutor.  When I run the application the threads fire off via the default work manager on the websphere server.  The problem that seems to be happening though is that even though I am using the workManagerTaskExecutor.waitForAll(collection,timeout); It never actually waits for the threads to complete.  I know that it is working that is the threads are executing their respective methods because if you issue a lengthy for loop after all of this the data is there where as if you do not the data is not there.  I was wondering the following two things.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is the WorkManagerTaskExecutor the way to go?  Or would using a ThreadPoolTaskExecutor be sufficient for handling multiple threads on a enterprise web application?</p></li>
<li><p>If the WorkManagerTaskExecutor is the way to go?  Any ideas as to why the waitForAll method is completing as if the methods are done?  When clearly they are not?  After the page loads I can see in the logging that the methods are still running and eventually completeing.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Any help would be much appreciated.  If I left anything out I will gladly try and give more information about the issue as I truly appreciate any help that might be given.</p>

<ol>
<li>Maybe it is not clear, but directory <code>static</code> is a sibling of WEB-INF and not its child.</li>
<li>The static directory might contain 2 GB of images. So it is not desired that this directory should be copied every time the application is deployed (so putting it in the classpath is not probably a good idea).</li>
<li>I just can't find the behaviour of DefaultServlet, which I allow to access this directory. Does it copy all the stuff somewhere else? Or does it access it as by absolute path?</li>

<p>My question is do you really think there is a huge difference in SPEED between the file based queue used by products like WebSphere MQ or the SQLite based queue? Both are file based after all and the fact that SQLIte is pure ANSI C does it well for speed.</p>

<p>SQLIte does offer some extra functionality like ""update hooks"" etc....and numerous others.</p>

<p>I guess what I would like to know is if you were going to implement a high speed persistent queue in C would you do it in a similar way to WebSphere MQ and have messages in different offsets etc in a single file, or would you use SQLIte in WAL mode?</p>

<p>Those applications are programmed with different technologies and they all have one thing in common: they can consume plain SOAP Web Service.</p>

<p>I already have a WCF Service that could be exposed but as it was built for internal purpose only, I never had to secure it.</p>

<p>I did read a lot of articles on how to secure WCF service and how to consume it from a Microsoft client application.  However, I'm really concern about the customer’s non-microsoft applications abilities to implement a standard WCF Service security.  I must keep in mind that some of them might be stateless and unable to hold on to a session or anything that might be required by a secure WCF Service.</p>

<p>So here are the options I have right now.</p>

<p>1) Add username/password parameters to each WCF function and perform a credential check on every call.  (I do have an SSL certificate... is it enough to consider this option as secured?)</p>

<p>2) Drop my WCF Service and create a plain SOAP Web Service with username/password parameters as mentioned in option #1 to be closer to my customer’s applications capabilities.</p>

<p>3) Implement standard WCF security and let the customers find a way to deal with it on their own.  (The real question here: is WCF security simple enough to be implemented by any SOAP client?)</p>

<p>4) Change my name and move to Jamaica with my customer’s money before they find out that I’m a Web Service security noob.</p>

<ul>
<li>Java EE webApp </li>
<li>JDK: 1.6,</li>
<li>AS: Websphere app server 7, </li>
<li>OS:redhatzLinux</li>
</ul>

<p>I am not a websphere admin and I am asked to develop a way or a script to solve the issue below: </p>

<p>I have a cluster with three nodes NodeA NodeB and NodeC. My application runs on these clusters. I want to deploy my application on these nodes such that i dont need to bring all of them down at once. These days the deployments is done this way : we come at night to stop all the servers all at once from console. Then we install the application on the main node which is on the same machine as the deployment manager and then we synchronize and bring all the servers back up one by one. </p>

<p><em><strong>What I am asked to do</em></strong> is that we upgrade the application or install the new ear file by not bringing everything down as this is causing downtime to the application. Is there a way to acheive this. WAS 7 is a very mature product i am sure there must be a way to do it. </p>

<p>I looked at the documentation/tutorial we can do something like ""Update"" where we select the application (from Apllications> websphere enterprise application)and select update and then select radio button ""Replace Entire Application"" and radio button""local file system"" and point to the new ear file. But in that case the doc says that it will bring down all the servers as well when updating. its the same as before. no online deployment.</p>

<p>I am a java programmer so I thought of using what tools I have to solve this </p>

<p><em><strong>Tell me if this is can be an issue</em></strong> : </p>

<p>1) We bring down NODEA 
2) We remove the NODEA from the cluster (by pressing remove node button or using the removeNode.sh)
3) Install the new Ear on the NODEA (can we do this in the same admin console? or through shell script or jython or may be like a standalone server)
3) We then start it up back again and then add it to cluster.
NOW we have NODEA with new applicaition while NODE B and NODEC are with old application versions.</p>

<p>Then we bring down NODEB 
remove NODEB from cluster
install applciation on NODEB 
start it up again 
Add it back to cluster</p>

<p>NOW we have two nodes with new application and NODEC with old</p>

<p>we try the same process for NODEC.</p>

<p>Will this work. Has any one tried this. what issues can you think of that can happen.</p>

<p>I will so appreciate any feedback from here. I am sure there are experienced ppl on this forum. I dont think this is a rare issue,i believe this is something any organization would want with High Availability requirements.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help in advance.

The application calls a web service developed and hosted by a third party partner.  Our production environment is running WebSphere 5.1 and the application is running just fine.  We need to migrate our servers off of 5.1  to 6.1 for security reasons.  We began by upgrading our development environment to 6.1.  In our development environment we decided to update the app to Java 1.5 in addition to the WebSphere migration.  The application on dev is working just fine.  All the web service calls execute correctly, with the exception of one.  This particular call always returns with the following error.</p>

<p><strong>No mapping found for 'http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/:string' using encoding style 'http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/'</strong></p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas why all the WS would work except this one?  I have not changed the code base, just what version compiler I am using.  Since it works on prod I am not sure what I could have done to mess up dev.</p>

"10518057","1","","","2012-05-09 14:21:57","10","193","<p>My application is a stand-alone Swing client invoking EJB Stateless Session beans thanks to classical JNDI lookup and RMI-IIOP method calls. It is started as a Java WebStart application. My aim is to retrieve the client user's identity from <code>EJBContext</code> with <code>getCallerPrincipal</code> method thanks to Kerberos SSO between the Windows workstation, ActiveDirectory and WebSphere server running on Linux.</p>

<p>I have already successfully configured my WebSphere cell in network deployment mode to support Kerberos authentication <a href=""http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/info/aes/ae/tsec_authusers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">thanks to the infocenter documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Both <code>krb5.conf</code> and <code>krb5.keytab</code> files are OK and tested with both Linux <code>kinit</code>, <code>klist</code> and <code>wsadmin</code>, <code>$AdminTask validateKrbConfig</code> answers <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/v7r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/info/aes/ae/tsec_kerb_auth_client.html"" rel=""nofollow"">client setup</a> does only refer to a JAAS <code>login.config</code> file to enable with command system property. My intuition tells me it is probably not enough.</p>

<p>But now, I find no more information to finalize the test case:</p>

<ul>
<li>how the JNDI initial context environment must be setup to trigger Kerberos negotiation ?</li>
<li>if there are other requirements on server-side like protect my EJB with a role (JBoss does not require it for instance) ?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update</strong> </p>

<p>As not running JavaEE client container with <code>./launchClient</code>, I have set in my JNLP the required properties to read <code>sas.client.props</code> and JAAS login configuration:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;property name=""java.security.auth.login.config"" value=""C:\temp\wsjaas_client.config""/&gt;
&lt;property name=""com.ibm.CORBA.ConfigURL"" value=""C:\temp\sas.client.props""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My <code>wsjaas_client.config</code> is for Oracle Java so it contains:</p>

<pre><code>WSKRB5Login{
    com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
       debug=true useTicketCache=true doNotPrompt=true;
};
</code></pre>

<p>My <code>sas.client.props</code> contains:</p>

<pre><code>com.ibm.CORBA.securityEnabled=true
com.ibm.CORBA.authenticationTarget=KRB5
com.ibm.CORBA.loginSource=krb5Ccache
com.ibm.CORBA.loginUserid=
com.ibm.CORBA.loginPassword=
com.ibm.CORBA.krb5CcacheFile=
com.ibm.CORBA.krb5ConfigFile=C:\\temp\\krb5.conf
</code></pre>

<p>At the moment, no Kerberos authentication is triggered: there is no TGS for the SPN <code>WAS/myserver.mydomain.com</code> in my kerberos cache (either from Windows or Linux workstations) and JNDI connection is still established anonymously.</p>

<p>No error message, no warning and finally no principal. How to diagnose what is wrong or lacking ?</p>

<p><strong>Update 2012/06/20</strong> </p>

<p>Here are some steps forward. In my application JLNP running with Oracle Java, I have set the following properties to use IBM ORB  and enable full trace and debug information:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;property name=""org.omg.CORBA.ORBSingletonClass"" value=""com.ibm.rmi.corba.ORBSingleton""/&gt;
&lt;property name=""org.omg.CORBA.ORBClass"" value=""com.ibm.CORBA.iiop.ORB""/&gt;
&lt;property name=""traceSettingsFile"" value=""C:\temp\TraceSettings.properties""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The file <code>TraceSettings.properties</code> contains</p>

<pre><code>traceFileName=c:\\temp\\traces.log
ORBRas=all=enabled
SASRas=all=enabled
com.ibm.*=all=enabled
</code></pre>

<p>When I set <code>Context.SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION</code> to the value <code>GSSAPI</code> in my JNDI environment properties, I get the following exception:</p>

<pre><code>javax.naming.ConfigurationException: Value ""GSSAPI"" specified for property java.naming.security.authentication is not valid.

<p>I have a java DAL class which loads an object with items from the database as follows:</p>

<pre><code>sql = ""SELECT COUNT(*) FROM projects"";
count = execute(sql) // this returns the count

sql = ""SELECT p.*, m.name AS clientName""
...
sql = sql + "" FROM projects p""
sql = sql + "" LEFT JOIN clients m ON p.clientID = m.id"";

Project[] p = execute(sql, count); //this returns Project array
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I have is the count script takes over 4 seconds to run and the select script takes about 2 seconds.  Although this is delivered to the presentation layer asynchronously, 6 seconds is still a very long time to wait (there are only about 300 records in the projects table).</p>

<p>I'm thinking that I can probably improve this by adding stored procedures and maybe adding additional filters to the scripts such as ""where active=1"".  But I'm wondering if anyone can suggest a better solution overall?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>EDIT: I've been doing some further testing with System.nanoTime() and I've found the largest chunk of the 4 seconds (3.8s) from the count script happens inside the execute function in one line:</p>

<pre><code>Connection c = getCon();
</code></pre>

<p>The getCon function does this:</p>

<pre><code>if (con == null) {
try {
Class.forName(""com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"").newInstance();
con = DriverManager.getConnection(db_connect_string,db_userid,db_password);
}
...
</code></pre>

<p>So I have a new question now - why would it take 3.8 seconds to get the db connection?</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/evTQB.jpg"" alt=""Multiple instances of multiple apps.""></p>

<ol>
<li>The Portal(producer) will send some message to the bus to which has to be processed by multiple applications(consumer) – PAYROLLAPP, HELPDESK etc.</li>
<li>Multiple instances of consumer applications may be running, also these <strong>instances can be added/
removed dynamically</strong></li>
<li>Now, it is critical to ensure that <strong>message is processed only once, per application</strong> i.e if
PAYROLLAPP -1 processes the message, PAYROLLAPP -2 should NOT process it; of course, in the
above diagram, HELPDESK – 1 must process it. In short, in case of multiple instances, exactly one
must process the message, once</li>
<li>When I searched for answers, most of the stuff was about creating a 'selective consumer' - a consumer that accepts/rejects a message based on some logic - please note that no changes/additions/wrapping can be done for the applications shown in the diagram; the logic has to reside somewhere in the provider that manages the bus</li>
</ol>

<p>Please guide about the same.</p>

<p>Adding more details after Petter's answer :</p>

<ol>
<li>The items to the to the left of the left-dotted line are the 'approaches' - Pure JMS,ESB,EAI</li>
<li>The items to the to the right of the right-dotted line are the 'implementations'</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Now, the big part - QUERIES :</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Irrespective of the solution(pure JMS, ESB, EAI), does the part
below the horizontal dotted line(application-specific queues) needs
to be implemented?</li>
<li>How does the usage of ESB(JBoss ESB etc.), instead of ‘pure’ JMS(Active MQ etc.), help/
hamper? Does ESB provide any advantage over JMS which is ‘java-only’(?). I am hell confused
– ‘ESB or JMS’, even after referring threads like these : <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5322675/jms-and-esb-how-they-are-related"">JMS and ESB - how they are related?</a>.
It has one reply which says “JMS is not well suited
for the integration of REST services, File systems, S/FTP, Email, Hessian, SOAP etc. which are
better handled with an ESB that supports these types natively. For example, if you have a process
that dumps a CSV file of 500MB at midnight, and you want another system to pickup the file,
parse CSV and import into a database, this can easily be accomplished by an ESB - whereas a
solution with just JMS will be bad. Similarly, integration of REST services, with load balancing/
failover to multiple backend instances can be done better with an ESB supporting HTTP/S
natively.” <em>It only added to my confusion !!!</em></li>
<li>Is the usage of EAI framework (Apache Camel etc.) an approach entirely different from the pure
JMS or ESB approach? If yes, how and what are the pros/cons?</li>
<li>I was told that ESB alone won’t help, BPM(or something else?) needs to be used to define and
store the ‘routing’ logic – is this true?</li>

So one process will put info in the Queue (and terminate) and another will pick it up and process it. My implementation leaves me facing a number of challenges and I am interested in what everyone's approach is to these problems (in terms of architecture as well as libraries).</p>

<p>Let me paint the picture. Lets say you have three processes:</p>

<pre><code>Process A -----&gt; Process B
                      |
Process C &lt;-----------|
</code></pre>

<p>So <strong>Process A</strong> puts a message in a queue and ends, <strong>Process B</strong> picks up the message, processes it and puts it in a ""return"" queue. <strong>Process C</strong> picks up the message and processes it. </p>

<ol>
<li>How does one handle <strong>Process B</strong> not listening or processing messages off the Queue? Is there some JMS type method that prevents a Producer from submitting a message when the Consumer is not active? So <strong>Process A</strong> will submit but throw an exception.</li>
<li>Lets say <strong>Process C</strong> has to get a reply with in X minutes, but <strong>Process B</strong> has stopped (for any reason), is there some mechanism that enforces a timeout on a Queue? So guaranteed reply within X minutes which would kick off <strong>Process C</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Can all of these matters be handled using a dead letter Queue of some sort? Should I maybe be doing this all manually with timers and check. I have mentioned JMS but I am open to anything, in fact I am using Hazelcast for the Queues. </p>

<p>Please note this is more of a architectural question, in terms of available java technologies and methods, and I do feel this is a proper question.</p>

<p>Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Can someone please give an example of an architecture that would use all of these technologies/concepts, and explain what <strong>role</strong> each of them play in the overall solution? Once I see a working example I'm sure it will help me connect most of the dots.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Since I added the bounty, I've had several answers that suggest reading books. Although I appreciate all feedback here, I simply can't part ways with 300 reputation points for an answer that, essentially, boils down to ""RTM"" (especially when I'm flat broke and can't <em>afford</em> the manual!) To reiterate, the bounty and definitive answer will go to someone who can hit all of these bullets in a meaningful, practical example. <strong>This does not have to be a middleware compendium!!!</strong> Just a paragraph or two that shows how all these can be used together in harmony to produce a Java business-tier solution.

<p>Currently, at WMQ side, there's a queue manager called <code>TestMgr</code>. Under this queue manager I created two channels. One is <code>PLAIN.CHL</code> which does not specify an SSL Cipher Spec, the other one is <code>SSL.CHL</code> which configured SSL Cipher Spec with <code>RC4_MD5_US</code> and SSL Authentication with <code>Optional</code>. </p>

<p>I have created a key store for the queue manager using IBM Key Management tool. The path of key db is <code>[wmq_home]\qmgrs\TestMgr\ssl\key</code>.</p>

<p>For channel <code>PLAIN.CHL</code>, I defined a queue connection factory like:</p>

<pre><code>DEF QCF(PlainQCF) QMANAGER(TestMgr) CHANNEL(PLAIN.CHL) HOST(192.168.66.23) PORT(1414)   TRANSPORT(client)
</code></pre>

<p>And under the SSL channel <code>SSL.CHL</code>, I defined a queue connection factory like:</p>

<p>Am I missing some context properties when looking up the SSL factory? connection And then I found the code is hanging on the line <code>new InitialContext( environment )</code> for a long time, almost 5 minutes, and I got <code>CC=2;RC=2009;AMQ9208...</code> error. </p>

<p>Any suggestion would be appreciated. Is it true that SSL channel can't be connected by JNDI?</p>

<h3>updates on MQEnvironment...</h3>

<p>reply the comments.</p>

<p>The value of <code>MQEnvironment.sslCipherSuite</code> is null, so it throws out NullPointerExcetpion when i put it the the env hashtable. But i tried another one <code>environment.put(MQC.SSL_CIPHER_SUITE_PROPERTY, ""SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5"")</code> and it still failed with <code>2009</code> error. </p>

<p>For <code>JMSAdmin</code> tool, i had changed the config to use <code>WMQInitialContextFactory</code>. The configuration like(<code>JMSAdmin.config</code>):</p>

<pre><code>INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY=com.ibm.mq.jms.context.WMQInitialContextFactory
PROVIDER_URL=192.168.66.23:1414/SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN
</code></pre>

<p>The rest configuration leaves as default.</p>

<p>Kindly note, here i use the default channel <code>SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN</code> so that i can logon to admin console. If I change the channel to the SSL one<code>SSL.CHL</code>, I also can't logon to admin console. The error happened here is just like the one in my client app. </p>

<p>Another clarification, in my client, i use follow code can connect to connect qmgr(<code>TestMgr</code>) successfully through channel <code>SSL.CHL</code>.</p>

<pre><code>   MQConnectionFactory factory = new MQConnectionFactory();
    factory.setTransportType(JMSC.MQJMS_TP_CLIENT_MQ_TCPIP);
    factory.setQueueManager(""TestMgr"");
    factory.setSSLCipherSuite(""SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5"");
    factory.setPort(1414);
    factory.setHostName(""192.168.66.23"");
    factory.setChannel(""SSL.CHL"");

    MQConnection connection = (MQConnection) factory.createConnection();
</code></pre>

<p>And now the problem is just like you said, that's the initial context failed connect to qmgr through SSL channel. The option(<code>use plain channel for initial context and ssl channel for connection factory</code>) you provided works too. But I still want to know how to get initial context with ssl channel work. Thanks for you patience very much. Your updates will be appreciated.</p>

<p>As a bit of a simplification, I think I should be able to do something like the following pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>shoppingApi.postTransaction(""paypal"", amount, currency, invoiceId, purchaseDescription)
</code></pre>

<p>and later on during a scheduled task or on notification from an IPN url:</p>

<pre><code>completedPayments = shoppingApi.getUnprocessedCompletedPayments();
for (Payment payment: completedPayments)
{
  // my code to process a successful payment.
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then I'd process the purchases. </p>

<p>I know there's tons of shopping carts out there that do this, but from what I've seen, they all want you to put your products in their system, which doesn't work for me. My products are in a 3rd party system, and I just want to process a payment. That's all.</p>

<p>And no cart I know of exposes a simple API like the one I'm suggesting above. I don't care what payment type my users use, I just want to know if they completed it. I know that Shopify.com has a REST api that does something like this, but it's not IPN like (it wants your products in it's system), and it's not opensource, which I'd prefer.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I know of course that there'd be other statuses that I'd need to look at, like ""pending"", etc, but that'd simply be another simple API call, like shoppingApi.getPendingPayments(). If the API did the above 2 calls, I'd be pretty happy ;-)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> I'd prefer opensource, but am totally open to commercial if it's a flat fee, can be trialed to some extent, and is reasonably mature/respectable </p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3 - MAJOR NOTE:</strong> I feel confident that such a library should exist. Whether or not it does is another question.

<p>I have Java 2 security enabled in Websphere, and I am logged in as 'admin5'. (I have a user with this username in my user database.) But when I access the application, there is never a call to the 'customAuthenticationUserDetailsService' bean to verify the username. I know this, because 'customAuthenticationUserDetailsService' does extensive logging which clearly shows what it is doing. When I am using the Siteminder pre-authentication - the 'customAuthenticationUserDetailsService' works just fine, I get some trace output in the log. But not for the J2EE authentication...</p>

<p>My guess is that one of these things is happening:</p>

<p>a) Java EE pre-authentication filter is not locating the username, so it never calls the authentication manager</p>

<p>b) Java EE pre-authentication filter works fine, but my custom authentication provider is never called by the authentication manager for some reason</p>

<p><em>By the way, the default authentication provider, which uses 'customUserDetailsService' does not kick in either. Again, I can tell that because there is no output from 'customUserDetailsService' in the log.</em></p>

<p><strong>Can you advise on what could be the problem here? If not a solution, then a suggestion on how to approach this would be greatly appreciated.</strong></p>

<p>How I can get current status for application deployed on websphere (such as started/stopped)? I know, that I can use <code>AdminControl.completeObjectName('type=Application,name=myApplication,*')</code> 
but if I just invoked start it is very much likely that following command will return nothing since app is not in running state yet. Same way, when I just invoked stop I want to display that app is actually stopped so that I won't change anything while app is still running. Any ideas how I can do this? Thanks.</p>

<p>Looking at the second (and last) stack trace cause, there seem to be some confusion or assumption about the JMX Server Instance Name. However, I have no control on that (and I can't figure why it works fine in Jetty and not in WAS 7).</p>

<p>I get the following error as soon as I add this:  to the file above. I have tried copying these two files (commons-logging-1.1.jar, log4j-1.2.6.jar) into WEB_INF/lib but didnt fx the problem. Doesnt seem to be much on the web on how to get this working as is. Any ideas ? </p>

<p>Please note that I can not change the classloading policy in Websphere as this would stop my app from working</p>

I can login smoothly without any problem, but it's got be very slow on response when doing operations such as showing Node status by clicking ""Nodes"" under ""System administration"", showing AppServer status by clicking ""Application Servers"" under ""Servers"" etc. However, the funny thing is the problem is more serious on remote node than the local nodes which locate on same box with DmgrNode.
So i suspect it should be the problem with network communication between DmgrNode and remote Node, but i don't know how to fix it.

<p>I have tried different versions of WebSphere's built-in JSF jars (after seeing <a href=""http://jforum.icesoft.org/JForum/posts/list/20359.page"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>), but no luck.  Does anyone know how to configure ICEFaces 1.8.2 to work with WAS 8?</p>

<p>Do I need to upgrade to ICEFaces 3?  If so, is the open-source version compatible with WAS 8?  (WAS 8 seems to be only listed under the EE version <a href=""http://www.icesoft.org/projects/ICEfaces/supported-platforms.jsf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>)</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I have an unpleasant security library that pulls authorization and authentication from multiple places, and will initially be on Tomcat for early development, followed by late development and production on Websphere. Rather than the hack-a-doo needed to get a custom realm set up through JAAS for Tomcat followed by another hack round on WAS, are there any common alternatives out there? </p>

<p>I've only ever done realm-based security on Tomcat. I have seen some interesting home brew approaches such as monitoring a user object in the session <a href=""http://www.vitarara.org/cms/struts_2_cookbook/creating_a_login_interceptor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vitarara.org/cms/struts_2_cookbook/creating_a_login_interceptor</a>. I'm also curious how wiki pages (for example) with <a href=""http://host.com/view.jsp?a_wiki_page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://host.com/view.jsp?a_wiki_page</a> manage to keep roles straight since this seems to be commonly needed for wikis and bbs, and maybe this is my solution?</p>

<p>Any advice?</p>

So I wrote the following script:</p>

<pre class=""lang-sh prettyprint-override""><code>  @echo off
  REM Author : Akshay Sinha
  REM Date Created : 07/05/2012
  REM Installing Websphere MQ.......
  Msiexec /q /i ""%CD%\MSI\IBM WebSphere MQ.msi"" /l*v .\install.log /m mif_file             TRANSFORMS=""1033.mst"" AGREETOLICENSE=""yes""
  echo Script to check if the installation failed !!!
  echo Waiting for installaion to complete.......
  REM Script will wait for 2 mins, This is to ensure that install.log gets fully             generated.
  ping 123.45.67.89 -n 1 -w 120000 &gt; nul
  echo Wait Over
  find /C ""Installation operation failed"" ""%CD%""\install.log &gt; tmp.log
  for /f ""tokens=1,2,3 delims=:"" %%a in (tmp.log) DO (
  SET /a FOUND_STR=%%c
  echo %FOUND_STR%
  )
  del tmp.log
  SET %FOUND_STR%=%FOUND_STR: =%
  echo %FOUND_STR%
  if %FOUND_STR% EQU 0 (
  echo Installation Of MQ completed without any errors!!!!!
  EXIT /B 0
  )
  if %FOUND_STR% GTR 0 (
  echo There were errors while installing MQ.. Pls Verify!!!
  EXIT /B 1
  )
</code></pre>

<p>the script is working fine for a fresh installation. ie if the mentioned software was not installed on the system already.</p>

<p>However, I need to enhance this script such that, it should check the system for existing installations of Websphere MQ and its version.
--if the version is not the one which we require(which of course , i will provide from command line) , it should initiate a uninstallation.</p>

<p>The problem is I don't want to use the approach of searching the file system.
So how do I accomplish this task using WMI classes.?? I looked up Win32_Product class, but it only returned me one installed program(Although, I have arnd 40 applications installed on my system).So I want to know:
1)what is the concrete method of searching for a particular program on a system.(I am open to VbScripting or batch programming)
2)Does the value of registry key for a installed software remains same across all systems and does it differ with different virsions??</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

  <ol>
  <li><p>is either inbound or outbound data through websphere transfered with SSL way according to the setting?</p></li>
  <li><p>is the above SSL setting enabled by default? If not, then how to enable it?</p></li>

<p>in the regard of KeyStore or TrustStore configuration, i can see it refers to path like </p>

  <p>${CONFIG_ROOT}/cells/localhostCell01/key.p12</p>

<p>I want to write some JUnit tests for the UserService.</p>

<p>I launch the application from within Eclipse, it's running on WebSphere.  I have a JUnit test in a new Java project in Eclipse.  My question is, how can my JUnit test access a reference to UserService?</p>

<p>Is there a way for me to do something like with an @EJB annotation:</p>

<pre><code>public class UserTests extends TestCase {

  @EJB  
  private UserServiceLocal userService;

  public void test1() throws Exception {
    Assert.assertTrue(""userService is not null"", (userService != null));
  }

}

<p>Here's a basic version of my UserService:</p>

<pre><code>@Stateless
public class UserService implements UserServiceLocal {

  @EJB
  private UserDAOLocal userDAO;

  /* ... */
}
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: @EJB doesn't inject anything.</p>

<p>NOTE: <code>userService = (UserServiceLocal)new InitiatContext().lookup(UserServiceLocal.JNDI);</code> doesn't work either, says, ""NamingManager.getURLContext cannot find the factory for this scheme: ejblocal""</p>

<pre><code>@Local
public class interface UserServiceLocal {

  public static final String JNDI = ""ejblocal:com.myapp.service.UserServiceLocal"";

  /* ... */
}

<p>All my pages are in XHTML format. I also added a facelets dependency to my project. And I'm using maven.</p>

<p>I made some configurations to try making the class loader to load PARENT_LAST. I don't know if it's correct, but while the log says that it's load the Mojarra 2.1.7, I think it's ok.</p>

<p>I found a post related with mine, but it isn't solved: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6867382/jsf-2-mojarra-and-primefaces-in-websphere-7"">JSF 2 Mojarra and Primefaces in WebSphere 7+</a></p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I tried to add the javax.faces.DEFAULT_SUFFIX context param to .xhtml. The result is that when I tried to open the arquivo.jsf, I see the source of the XHTML. Although the log is saying it's initializing the Mojarra 2.1.7, I am feeling that there's some conflict here.</p>

<p>This is my ear-plugin configuration of the ear's maven module:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;plugin&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-ear-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.6&lt;/version&gt;

        &lt;version&gt;5&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;defaultLibBundleDir&gt;lib&lt;/defaultLibBundleDir&gt;
        &lt;earSourceDirectory&gt;${basedir}\src\main\application\META-INF\ibmconfig&lt;/earSourceDirectory&gt;
    &lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>At \src\main\application\META-INF\ibmconfig, there's the deployment.xml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;appdeployment:Deployment xmi:version=""2.0"" xmlns:xmi=""http://www.omg.org/XMI"" xmlns:appdeployment=""http://www.ibm.com/websphere/appserver/schemas/5.0/appdeployment.xmi"" xmi:id=""Deployment_1241112964096""&gt;

    &lt;/modules&gt;
  &lt;/deployedObject&gt;
&lt;/appdeployment:Deployment&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And in my web's maven module, I have this dependencies:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.sun.faces&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;jsf-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;

&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.sun.facelets&lt;/groupId&gt;

&lt;dependency&gt;

    &lt;scope&gt;compile&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Is there something wrong? I'm new on WebSphere and I need to use it with JSF 2.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I removed the jsf-facelets dependency, but it's not working yet.
I exported an EAR to see if the deployment.xml is there, but it's not being packaged within the EAR. Is there something wrong?</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Now, I'm following this tutorial: <a href=""http://www.webspheretools.com/sites/webspheretools.nsf/docs/How%20to%20set%20the%20class%20loading%20policy%20to%20parent%20last%20using%20configuration%20files%20shipped%20within%20the%20EAR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webspheretools.com/sites/webspheretools.nsf/docs/How%20to%20set%20the%20class%20loading%20policy%20to%20parent%20last%20using%20configuration%20files%20shipped%20within%20the%20EAR</a></p>

<p>My deployment.xml is under \META-INF\ibmconfig\cells\defaultCell\applications\
defaultApp\deployments\defaultApp, and my ear plugin's configuration is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;plugin&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-ear-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.6&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;configuration&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;5&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;defaultLibBundleDir&gt;lib&lt;/defaultLibBundleDir&gt;
    &lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This way, the deployment.xml is being packaged when I export the EAR. My deployment.xml is the same as shown in the tutorial.</p>

<p>Anyway, when I deploy my application on WebSphere, it generates a new deployment.xml, ignoring mine. Then, it still loading parent first.</p>

<p>For the test I coded getItSomehow() just as create HashMap and fill it with key ""hello_world"" and value ""[""+locale+""]""+""hello world""</p>

<p>The sample works fine when I deploy it on Glassfish3. 
But when I use WebSphere AS 7, the jsf page is displayed correctly only for the first time. Opening the jsf page in other browsers (with other prefered language selected) I receive the respond always in the locale of first run. </p>

<p>While debugging, I found the difference in implementation of ResourceBundle.java: Glassfish uses this class provided in rt.jar of the JDK1.6; but WebSphere has this class inside java.util.jar</p>

<p>The ResourceBundle (of WebSphere) called from ApplicationResourceBundle.getResourceBundle() calls handleGetBundle() and finally invokes my.i18n.DbResourceBundle$DBControl.newBundle() .
Called second (and further) time with different locale it doesn't invoke my override but just returns the same bundle created for first locale. </p>

<p>The server starts up no problem, loads Geronimo quite fast, however, when I started to deploy my web application, it is taking forever, and once it is deployed, it takes forever to navigate through pages.</p>

<p>I've been monitoring the server activity, the CPU is not so busy, however, 60% of the memory is being used up. Could this be the problem?</p>

<p>If so, what are my options? Should I consider upgrading this cloud server to something with more RAM, or changing a host provider to better suit my needs?</p>

<p>Edit:
I should note that, even if I don't deploy my application, just having Geronimo loaded, sometimes I would get a connection time when I try to shut down Geronimo.</p>

<p>Also the database is on the same server as the application. (however I wouldn't say its query intensive)</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:<br/>
After what @matiu suggested, I tried running free -m, and this is the output that I get:</p>

<pre><code>             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached

<p>This was totally different result than running <em>ps ux</em>, which is how I got my previous 60%.</p>

<p>And I did an iostat check, and about 25% iowait time, and device is constantly writing and reading.</p>

<p><hr>
<strong>update:</strong>
<br>Upgraded my hosting to 512MB, now it is up to speed! Something I should note is, I forgot about the Java's Permanent Generation memory, which is also used by Geronimo. So it turns out, I do need more RAM, and more RAM did solve my problem. (As expected) yay.</p>

Now that we have products like maven, I've been wondering why this still needs to be the case. For example, one might have a central final release-only repo for all running java applications on a particular machine or a particular application server. For app servers, if you created a singular dependency on something that handles dependencies programmatically, perhaps through a maven-like mechanism in the Spring configuration, couldn't you have all of your dependencies just handled auto-magically?  If it couldn't be done in the Spring configuration, then perhaps the container could be extended? I suppose the trick might be building the Classpath but that really doesn't seem insurmountable. Especially since the top 3 OS's now all have symbolic links. Haven't looked in quite a while but it appears there is now a way to handle and/or create them in Java:</p>

<p><a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/links.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/links.html</a></p>

<p>Of course symbolic links might even be overkill. </p>

<p>I suppose what I am asking is, couldn't you use these ideas to greatly simplify dependency management or deployment for all JSE / JEE applications?</p>

<p>I am working on an enhancement to the application that will allow calls through a Message Driven Pojo linked to a Websphere Queue.  I was able to setup a configuration through spring that will allow my application to receive messages through a JMS queue.  The spring config looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;jee:jndi-lookup id=""jmsConnectionFactory"" jndi-name=""QueueConnectionFactory""/&gt;
&lt;jee:jndi-lookup id=""jmsQueue"" jndi-name=""DIQueue"" /&gt;

&lt;/bean&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure if there is an issue with my spring setup, but I do receive messages through my Active MQ broker, so that part I seem to be good with.</p>

<p>Now, the issue is, that when I get a message in through JMS, I would call the above code to insert the JPA entity.  When the code would run, I would get the message ""unable to commit a one phase resource in a two phase transaction"", or something similar.  What I came to understand is that the Spring JpaTransactionManager does not work with XA or JTA transactions.</p>

<p>So, I worked on moving to the Spring JtaTransactionManager.</p>

<p>I changed everything I Could think of over to use JTA, here is where I declare my transaction manager:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id=""transactionManager"" class=""org.springframework.transaction.jta.WebSphereUowTransactionManager""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Updated my persistence XML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;persistence-unit name=""AppUnit"" transaction-type=""JTA""&gt;        
    &lt;provider&gt;oracle.toplink.essentials.ejb.cmp3.EntityManagerFactoryProvider&lt;/provider&gt;
    &lt;jta-data-source&gt;java:APPDS&lt;/jta-data-source&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>And still, nothing works.  My code runs without exception, but nothing gets persisted to the database.  The message gets pulled off of the JMS Queue, but no data.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

  ...The message must be put on the (IBM Websphere) MessageQueue as a IBytesMessage</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The XML document, for simplicities sake, looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
&lt;foo&gt;
  &lt;lastname&gt;John ÐØë&lt;/lastname&gt;
  &lt;city&gt;John ÐØë&lt;/city&gt;
  &lt;other&gt;UTF-8 string&lt;/other&gt;
&lt;/foo&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The ""ÐØë"" part are (or should be) <a href=""http://www.ascii-code.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">ASCII values</a> 208, 216, 235 respectively.</p>

<p>I also have an object:</p>

<pre><code>public class foo {
  public string lastname { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So I instantiate an object and set the lastname:</p>

<pre><code>var x = new foo() { lastname = ""John ÐØë"", city = ""John ÐØë"" };
</code></pre>

<p>Now this is where my headache sets in (or the <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/"" rel=""nofollow"">inception</a> if you will...):</p>

<ul>
<li>Visual studio / source code is in <strong>Unicode</strong></li>
<li>Hence: Object has an <strong>Unicode</strong> lastname</li>
<li>The XML Serializer uses <strong>UTF-8</strong> to encode the document</li>
<li>Lastname should contain only (Extended) <strong>ASCII</strong> characters; the characters are valid <strong>ASCII</strong> chars but ofcourse in UTF-8 encoded form</li>
</ul>

<p>I normally don't experience any trouble with my encodings; I am familiar with <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html"" rel=""nofollow"">The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)</a> but this one's got me stumped...</p>

<p>I understand that the UTF-8 document will be perfectly able to ""contain"" both encodings because the codepoints 'overlap'. But where I get lost is when I need to convert the serialized message to a byte-array. When doing a dump I see <code>C3 XX C3 XX C3 XX</code> (I don't have the actual dump at hand). It's clear (or I've been staring at this for too long) that the lastname / city strings are put in the serialized document in their unicode form; the byte-array suggests so.</p>

<p>Now what will I have to do, and where, to ensure the Lastname string goes into the XML document and finally the byte-array as an <strong>ASCII</strong> string (and the actual 208, 216, 235 byte sequence), and that City makes it in there as <strong>ISOLatin1</strong>?</p>

<p>I know the requirements are backwards, but I can't change those (3rd party). I always use UTF-8 for our internal projects so I have to support the unicode-utf8=>ASCII/ISOLatin1 conversion (ofcourse, only for chars that are in those sets).</p>

<p>All DB's are shared and no network resources as opposed to local so a lack of DB2 or Oracle on my box shouldn't be an issue. My main concern is how to run the local testing server, and how to get all the basics set up.

<p>Is it possible to do this, and keep everything but the DB's local and native? Or am I stuck with using the windows based toolkit?</p>

The basic idea is that when internal, authenticated users in the domain accesses a page, it will be as per normal. However, should external users try to access it, it will direct them to a login page, interface with Active Directory, and redirect them to the page upon correct authentication.</p>

<p>In order to make it work, I have tried to modify Web.xml to allow form authentication with the built-in ""j_security_check"" servlet. Upon logging in, it will greet the user ""Hello, !"" with a simple function <em>&lt;% request.getRemoteUser() %></em> or <em>&lt;% request.getUserPrincipal().getName() %></em>.</p>

<p>Based on the <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/1.4/tutorial/doc/Security5.html"" rel=""nofollow"">examples found here</a>, I modified my Web.xml details as below:</p>

<p>Under my login.jsp, I have a simple form that does the logging in.</p>

    Password: &lt;input type=""password"" name=""j_password""&gt;
    &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Login""&gt;

    Hello, &lt;% request.getRemoteUser(); %&gt;
    Hello, &lt;% request.getUserPrincipal().getName(); %&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I am facing three issues here. Importance ranked as it is.</p>

<p>1) Error 403
The redirecting and logging in page works. When I try to access index.jsp, I am redirected to login.jsp. When I enter an incorrect uid:pwd pair, I am greeted with error.jsp. When I log in correctly, I am redirected back to index.jsp but I am greeted with an <em>Error 403: The Website requires you to log in</em>. I am sure I have logged in because I am previously unable to access the built-in <em>snoop</em> page, but after logging in, I can. I suspect it is some settings in my Web.xml</p>

<p>2) Getting the user's ID
Even upon disabling all protection in the Web.xml and accessing the index.jsp, I am greeted with a ""<em>Hello, null!</em>"" instead of ""<em>Hello, user!</em>"". The codes as shown in the index.jsp should be correct as I copied it out from snoop sample codes found on the internet. <em>request.getRemoteUser()</em> does not work on my index.jsp but works on the snoop page. There must be something I am not calling before performing the request?</p>

<p>3) Security (not important, yet)
I think this j_security_check is under Spring Security. I am trying to encrypt both the sending and the receiving side as well as the transport channel. This is because for authentication, I believe the password must not be sent or stored in clear text. I found <a href=""http://www.datadisk.co.uk/html_docs/java_app/tomcat6/tomcat6_security.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">some information here</a> which led me to attempt/try to protect this process of authentication.</p>

<p>I would appreciate some guidance and help with regards to the top 3 issues I am facing. It feels like I am close to getting the thing done but it's so close, yet so far...</p>

We are facing simple problem in our company. We need to use reliable message-based system for communication of nodes in cluster. Since we have ""our own"" solution for this, it's becoming quite clutter for us as we are trying to add more and more functionality into it (plus, it's buggy :)).</p>

<p>I really don't want to raise another question about which broker is better/worse, I would rather like to ask you about your personal experience and observation about reliability/complexity/flexibility of JMS/AMQP brokers. (i.e. I've found some confusing information about ActiveMQ, saying it's not stable yet many people consider it to be best JMS solution out there)</p>

<p>Currently, our system sends approx. 100 mps, so it's not big load, yet we need to be able to scale it in the future as more and more nodes will be added into cluster. Each node should be will be sending and receiving messages. We need to find as reliable solution as possible. </p>

<p>Thank you for your answers.</p>

<li>Object A.1 (New instance) - placed into Session with ID ""ABC""</li>
<li>retrieve object with ID ""ABC"" from the session - RESULT: A.1 (Correct)</li>
<li>carry out a Servlet forward or a redirect (issues seen on both functions)..</li>
<li>retrieve ""ABC"" from the session - RESULT: A.0, the object that was removed from the session..</li>
</ol>

<p>Notes - </p>

<ul>
<li>Same Session object (hashcode/session ID) used in steps 1-5 using in
memory replication across 2 JVMs (single cluster) </li>
<li>time duration    between steps 2 &amp; 5 is total of 4 seconds</li>
<li>No other external threads have accessed the session in the interim..</li>
<li>Only noticed for 1 specific use-case; haven't encountered this in<br>
other use-cases..</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyone seen anything like this before where a stale data is being returned from the websphere application server? </p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Ian.</p>

<p>Since now I have implemented that myself using a simple POST HTML form:</p>

<ol>
<li>checking the sent parameters against the database</li>
<li>if present, save a User object into the HttpSession</li>
<li>check in every Servlet whether this object is present</li>
<li>if not: redirect to the login page with an error message</li>
</ol>

<p>But now I have stumbled over <a href=""http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/How+to+Configure+Security+with+Embedded+Jetty"">How to Configure Security with Embedded Jetty</a> and now I am thinking of that I can reuse already implemented solutions to that problem, but what is the standard approach here? I am using Jetty myself, but what about Tomcat or other web servers?</p>

<p>I also read about <strong>j_security_check</strong>, what's with that? Is that a legacy method?</p>
