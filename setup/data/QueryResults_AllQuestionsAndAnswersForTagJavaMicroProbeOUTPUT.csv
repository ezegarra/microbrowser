<p>It seems people are assuming I am talking about private or protected variables/properties only. When I learned OO I was taught to use getters/setters for every single property even if it was public (and actually I was told never to make any variable/property public). So, I may be starting off from a false assumption from the get go. It appears that people answering this question are maybe saying that you should have public properties and that those don't need getters and setters, which goes against what I was taught, and what I was talking about, although maybe that needs to be discussed as well. That's probably a good topic for a different question though...</p>

This is further indicated when I try to print the default time zone's <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/TimeZone.html#getDisplayName()"" rel=""nofollow"">display name</a>, and it comes up ""GMT-08:00"", which seems to indicate to me that it is not correctly set to the US Pacific time zone.  I am running on Ubuntu Hardy Heron, upgraded from Gutsy Gibbon.</p>

<p>Is there a configuration file I can update to tell the JRE to use Pacific with all the associated daylight savings time information?  The time on my machine shows correctly, so it doesn't seem to be an OS-wide misconfiguration.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ok, here's an update. A coworker suggested I update JAVA_OPTS in my /etc/profile to include ""-Duser.timezone=US/Pacific"", which worked (I also saw CATALINA_OPTS, which I updated as well). Actually, I just exported the change into the variables rather than use the new /etc/profile (a reboot later will pick up the changes and I will be golden).</p>

<p>However, I still think there is a better solution... there should be a configuration for Java somewhere that says what timezone it is using, or how it is grabbing the timezone. If someone knows such a setting, that would be awesome, but for now this is a decent workaround.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am using 1.5, and it is most definitely a DST problem.  As you can see, the time zone is set to not use daylight savings.  My belief is it is generically set to -8 offset rather than the specific Pacific timezone.  Since the generic -8 offset has no daylight savings info, it's of course not using it, but the question is, where do I tell Java to use Pacific time zone when it starts up?  I'm NOT looking for a programmatic solution, it should be a configuration solution.</p>

It seemed pretty robust, but we found out that it wasn't terribly configurable.  Or at least not configurable enough to meet our needs.

Mostly I've written database driven applications, but occasionally, even those require some file io. Since I do it so rarely, I end up googling around for quite some time to figure out the exact incantation that Java requires to read a file into a byte[], char[], String or whatever I need at the time.</p>

<p>For a 'once and for all' list, I'd like to see all of the usual ways to get data from a file into Java, or vice versa. There will be a fair bit of overlap, but the point is to define all of the subtle different variants that are out there.</p>

<p>For example: </p>

<ol>
<li>Read/Write a text file from/to a single String.</li>
<li>Read a text file line by line.</li>
<li>Read/Write a binary file from/to a single byte[].</li>
<li>Read a binary file into a byte[] of size x, one chunk at a time.</li>
</ol>

<p>The goal is to show concise ways to do each of these. Samples do not need to handle missing files or other errors, as that is generally domain specific. Feel free to suggest more IO tasks that are somewhat common and I have neglected to mention. </p>

<p>Using JConsole I was able to determine who was running and what they were doing.  It took me a few hours to then figure out why it was doing it.  The problem ended up being that the vendor's API jar that was being used did not match exactly to the the database configuration that it was using.  It was defaulting to having tracing and performance monitoring enabled on the servers that had the slight mis-match in configuration.  I used a different jar and all is well.</p>

<p>One is using a tree structure just as the previous one. The drawback of this structure is that you need a ton of tweaking/hacks to get the multi-module reporting work well with Maven. Another downside is that in Subversion the standard trunk/tags/branches approach add even more complexity to the repository.</p>

<p>The other approach uses a flat structure, where there are only one parent project and all the modules, submodules and parts-of-the-submodules are a direct child of the parent project. This approach works well for reporting and is easier in Subversion, however I feel I lose a bit of the structure this way.</p>

For those that don't know (probably everyone), Project Darkstar is a framework for massively multiplayer online games that attempts to take care of all of the ""hard stuff.""  The basic idea is that you write your game server logic in such a way that all operations are broken up into tiny tasks.  You pass these tasks to the Project Darkstar framework which handles distributing them to a specific node in the cluster, any concurrency issues, and finally persisting the data.</p>

<p>Apparently doing this kind of thing is a much different problem for video games than it is for enterprise applications.  Jim Waldo, who gave the lecture, claims that MMO games have a DB read/write ratio of 50/50, whereas enterprise apps are more like 90% read, 10% write.  He also claims that most existing MMOs keep everything in memory exlcusively, and only dump to a DB every 6 hours of so.  This means if a server goes down, you would lose all of the work since the last DB dump.</p>

<p>Now, the project itself sounds really cool, but I don't think the industry will accept it.  First, you have to write your server code in Java.  The client code can be written in anything (Jim claims ActionScript 3 is the most popular, follow by C++), but the server stuff has to be Java.  Sounds good to me, but I really get the impression that everyone in the games industry hates Java.</p>

<p>Second, unlike other industries where developers prefer to use existing frameworks and libraries, the guys in the games industry seem to like to write everything themselves.  Not only that, they like to rewrite everything for every new game they produce.  Things are starting to change where developers are using Havok for physics, Unreal Engine 3 as their platform, etc., but for the most part it looks like everything is still proprietary.</p>

<p>So, are the guys at Project Darkstar just wasting their time?  Can a general framework like this really work for complex games with the performance that is required?  Even if it does work, are game companies willing to use it?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> As a clarification, the exceptions aren't for logs and what-not, this relates to how code reacts to them.

<p>My code would want to react differently to each of these issues (mostly by changing the message returned to the client, but actual logic as well).</p>

  public ImageWrapper(final Image lwuitBuffer) {
    this.image = lwuitBuffer;
  }

  public javax.microedition.lcdui.Graphics getGraphics() {

<p>Now I can get the 'native' Graphics element from LWUIT. Paint on it - effectively painting on LWUIT image. And I can use the image to paint on a component.</p>

<p>And it still looks like a hack :)</p>

<p>From reading the Javadoc about <code>readLine()</code> it says: </p>

<p>Reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed (<code>\n</code>), a carriage return (<code>\r</code>), or a carriage return followed immediately by a linefeed. </p>

<p><strong>Returns</strong>:
A <code>String</code> containing the contents of the line, not including any line-termination characters, or null if the end of the stream has been reached </p>

<p><strong>Throws</strong>: 
<code>IOException</code> - If an I/O error occurs</p>

<p>From my understanding of this, <code>readLine</code> should return null the first time no input is entered other than a line termination, like <code>\r</code>. However, this code just ends up looping infinitely. After debugging, I have found that instead of null being returned when just a termination character is entered, it actually returns an empty string (""""). This doesn't make sense to me.

Examining solutions in terms of ease of programing, supported topologies (ie. single data center versus over the WAN ), number of supported nodes.  Issues faced, work arounds.

<p>I've decided to explore the option having the same program, that currently recieves a single format XML document, receive two additional XML document formats, with various XML element changes.  I was hoping to just swap out the ContentHandler with an appropriate one based on the first ""startElement"" in the document... but, uh-duh, the ContentHandler is set and <strong>then</strong> the document is parsed!</p>

<pre><code>... constructor ...
{
SAXParserFactory spf = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();

try {
SAXParser sp = spf.newSAXParser();
parser = sp.getXMLReader();
parser.setErrorHandler(new MyErrorHandler());
} catch (Exception e) {} 

... parse StringBuffer ...
try {
parser.setContentHandler(pP);
parser.parse(new InputSource(new StringReader(xml.toString())));
return true;

For speed and efficiency purposes I never really looked at DOM because these XML documents are fairly large and the system receives about 1200 every few minutes.

<p>To make this question too long and add to my confusion; following is a mockup of some various XML documents that I would like to have a single SAX, StAX, or ?? parser cleanly deal with. </p>

<p>If, however, before X seconds has elapsed, I decide that the event should occur after Y seconds instead, then I want to be able to tell the timer to reset its time so that the event occurs in Y seconds.
 E.g. the timer should be able to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>Timer timer = new Timer();  
timer.schedule(timerTask, 5000); //Timer starts in 5000 ms (X)

//At some point between 0 and 5000 ms...

<p>But I want to recover from specific problems, and I'm not sure the best way to approach it with unchecked exceptions. Here is a concrete example.</p>

<p>Suppose I have a web application, built using Struts2 and Hibernate. If an exception bubbles up to my ""action"", I log it, and display a pretty apology to the user. But one of the functions of my web application is creating new user accounts, that require a unique user name. If a user picks a name that already exists, Hibernate throws an <code>org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException</code> (an unchecked exception) down in the guts of my system. I'd really like to recover from this particular problem by asking the user to choose another user name, rather than giving them the same ""we logged your problem but for now you're hosed"" message.</p>

<p>Here are a few points to consider:</p>

<ol>
<li>There a lot of people creating accounts simultaneously. I don't want to lock the whole user table between a ""SELECT"" to see if the name exists and an ""INSERT"" if it doesn't. In the case of relational databases, there might be some tricks to work around this, but what I'm really interested in is the general case where pre-checking for an exception won't work because of a fundamental race condition. Same thing could apply to looking for a file on the file system, etc.</li>
<li>Given my CTO's propensity for drive-by management induced by reading technology columns in ""Inc."", I need a layer of indirection around the persistence mechanism so that I can throw out Hibernate and use Kodo, or whatever, without changing anything except the lowest layer of persistence code. As a matter of fact, there are several such layers of abstraction in my system. How can I prevent them from leaking in spite of unchecked exceptions?</li>
<li>One of the declaimed weaknesses of checked exceptions is having to ""handle"" them in every call on the stack&mdash;either by declaring that a calling method throws them, or by catching them and handling them. Handling them often means wrapping them in another checked exception of a type appropriate to the level of abstraction. So, for example, in checked-exception land, a file-system&ndash;based implementation of my UserRegistry might catch <code>IOException</code>, while a database implementation would catch <code>SQLException</code>, but both would throw a <code>UserNotFoundException</code> that hides the underlying implementation. How do I take advantage of unchecked exceptions, sparing myself of the burden of this wrapping at each layer, without leaking implementation details?</li>

<p>I am working on a site that will allow the user to download very large files (up to and exceeding 100GB)</p>

<p>What is the best way to do this <strong><em>without using FTP</em></strong>.  The end user must be able to download the file from there browser using HTTP.  I don't think Flash or Silverlight can save files to the client so as far as I know they won't cut it.</p>

<p>I'm guessing we will need an ActiveX or Java applet to pull this off.  Something like the download manager that MSDN uses.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a commercial (or free) component that will do that?  We do not want the user to have to install a ""browser wide"" download manager (like GetRight), we want it to only work with downloading on our site. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Here is some additional info to help clarify what I'm trying to do.  Most of the files above the 4GB limit would be large HD video files (its for a video editing company).  These will be downloaded by users across the internet, this isn't going to be people on a local network.  We want the files to be available via HTTP (some users are going to be behind firewalls that aren't going to allow FTP, Bittorrent, etc.).  The will be a library of files the end user could download, so we aren't talking about a one time large download.  The will be download different large files on a semi-regular basis.</p>

<p>So far Vault that @Edmund-Tay suggested is the closest solution so far.  The only problem is that it doesn't work for files larger than 4GB (it instantly fails before starting the download, they are probably using a 32bit integer somewhere that the content length of the file exceeds).</p>

<p>A java applet (or ActiveX component since the problem only exist in IE) that worked like the article @spoulson linked to would be the best solution, but so far I haven't had any luck finding one that does anything like that (multipart downloads, resume, etc.).</p>

<p>It looks like we might have to write our own.  Another option would be to write a .Net application (maybe ClickOnce) that is associated with an extension or mime type.  Then the user would actually be downloading a small file from the web server that opens in the exe/ClickOnce app that tells the application what file to download.  That is how the MSDN downloader works.  The end user would then only have to download/install an EXE once.

<p>Well, the whole thing about changing templates place is to put the templates in a designer accessible area, so any modification needed, the designer can load them to his/her computer, edit, and upload it again.

<p>The conditions are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The protocol is asynchronous</li>
<li>A third party can modify the data at any time</li>
<li>The command round-trip can be significant</li>
<li>The model should be well suited for UI interaction</li>
<li>The protocol supports queries over certain objects, and so must the model</li>
</ul>

<p>As a means of improving my lacking skills in this area (and brush up my Java in general), I have started a <a href=""http://Telharmonium.devjavu.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">project</a> to create an Eclipse-based front-end for <a href=""http://xmms2.xmms.se"" rel=""nofollow"">xmms2</a> (described below).</p>

<p>So, the question is; how should I expose the remote interface as a neat data model (In this case, track management and event handling)?</p>

<p>I welcome anything from generic discussions to pattern name-dropping or concrete examples and patches :)</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>My primary goal here is learning about this class of problems in general. If my project can gain from it, fine, but I present it strictly to have something to start a discussion around.</p>

<p>I've implemented a protocol abstraction which I call <a href=""http://telharmonium.devjavu.com/browser/trunk/xmms2-client"" rel=""nofollow"">'client'</a> (for legacy reasons) which allows me to access most exposed features using method calls which I am happy with even if it's far from perfect.</p>

<p>The features provided by the xmms2 daemon are things like track searching, meta-data retrieval and manipulation, change playback state, load playlists and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>I'm in the middle of updating to the latest stable release of xmms2, and I figured I might as well fix some of the glaring weaknesses of my current implementation.</p>

<p>My plan is to build a better abstraction on top of the protocol interface, one that allows a more natural interaction with the daemon. The current <a href=""http://telharmonium.devjavu.com/browser/trunk/xmms2-model"" rel=""nofollow"">'model'</a> implementation is hard to use and is frankly quite ugly (not to mention the UI-code which is truly horrible atm).</p>

<p>Today I have the <a href=""http://telharmonium.devjavu.com/browser/trunk/xmms2-model/src/se/fnord/xmms2/model/Tracks.java"" rel=""nofollow"">Tracks</a> interface which I can use to get instances of <a href=""http://telharmonium.devjavu.com/browser/trunk/xmms2-model/src/se/fnord/xmms2/model/Track.java"" rel=""nofollow"">Track</a> classes based on their id. Searching is performed through the <a href=""http://telharmonium.devjavu.com/browser/trunk/xmms2-model/src/se/fnord/xmms2/model/Collections.java"" rel=""nofollow"">Collections</a> interface (unfortunate namespace clash) which I'd rather move to Tracks, I think.</p>

<p>Any data can be modified by a third party at any time, and this should be properly reflected in the model and change-notifications distributed</p>

<p>These interfaces are exposed when connecting, by returning an object hierarchy that looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Connection
<ul>
<li>Playback getPlayback()
<ul>
<li>Play, pause, jump, current track etc</li>
<li>Expose playback state changes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tracks getTracks()
<ul>
<li>Track getTrack(id) etc</li>
<li>Expose track updates</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Collections getCollection()

<li>Load and manipulate playlists or named collections</li>
<li>Query media library</li>
<li>Expose collection updates</li>

<li><p><strong>Straight old Serialization using ObjectOutputStream and its various related classes</strong>: I'm not sold on it though since I find the data brittle.  Changing any object's structure breaks the serialized instances of it.  So I'm locked in to what seems to be a horrible versioning nightmare.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>XML Serialization</strong>: It's not as brittle, but it's significantly slower that straight out serialization.  It can be transformed outside of my program.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>JavaDB</strong>: I'd considered this since I'm comfortable writing JDBC applications. The difference here is that the database instance would only persist while the file was being opened or saved.  It's not pretty but... it does lend itself to migrating to a central server architecture if the need arises later and it introduces the possibility of quering the datamodel in a simpler way.</p></li>

Ok, I've read the answers so far but lets just say I am a cheap bastard (meaning I am more interested in learning how to use JHat than to pay for JProfiler).

<pre><code>public void showSelection(IWorkbenchPart sourcePart) {

<p>I think it is pretty clear what I am trying to do. I expect @ManyToOne person to be inherited by UglyProblem class. But there will be an exception saying something like: ""There is no such property found in UglyProblem class (mappedBy=""person"")"".</p>

<p>All I found is <a href=""http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/ANN-558"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>. I was not able to find the post by Emmanuel Bernard explaining reasons behind this. </p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unfortunately, according to the Hibernate documentation ""Properties from superclasses not mapped as @MappedSuperclass are ignored.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well I think this means that if I have these two classes:</p>

<pre><code>public class A {
    private int foo;
}

@Entity
public class B extens A {
}
</code></pre>

<p>then field <code>foo</code> will not be mapped for class  B. Which makes sense. But if I have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
public class Problem {

@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
private Long id;

private String name;

public Long getId() {
    return id;
}

public void setId(Long id) {
    this.id = id;
}

public String getName() {
    return name;
}

public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
}
}

@Entity
public class UglyProblem extends Problem {

private int levelOfUgliness;

public int getLevelOfUgliness() {
    return levelOfUgliness;
}

public void setLevelOfUgliness(int levelOfUgliness) {
    this.levelOfUgliness = levelOfUgliness;
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>I expect the class UglyProblem to have fileds <code>id</code> and <code>name</code> and both classes to be mapped using same table. (In fact, this is exactly what happens, I have just checked again). I have got this table:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE ""problem"" (
    ""DTYPE"" varchar(31) NOT NULL,
    ""id"" bigint(20) NOT NULL auto_increment,
    ""name"" varchar(255) default NULL,
    ""levelOfUgliness"" int(11) default NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY  (""id"")
) AUTO_INCREMENT=2;
</code></pre>

<p>Going back to my question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I expect @ManyToOne person to be inherited by UglyProblem class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I expect that because all other mapped fields are inherited and I do not see any reason to make this exception for ManyToOne relationships.</p>

<hr>

<p>Yeah, I saw that. In fact, I used Read-Only solution for my case. But my question was ""Why..."" :). I know that there is an explanation given by a member of hibernate team. I was not able to find it and that is why I asked.</p>

<pre><code>Ã¡Ã©Ã­Ã³Ãº
</code></pre>

<p>Clearly, that's not encoded properly. Yet Firebug reports that the page is served up in UTF-8, so presumably the form submission request would also be encoded in UTF-8. Inspecting the value as it comes from the database produces the correct string, so it wouldn't appear to be an OS or IDE encoding issue. I have not overridden Tapestry's default value for org.apache.tapestry.output-encoding in the .application file, and the Tapestry 4 <a href=""http://tapestry.apache.org/tapestry4/UsersGuide/configuration.html#configuration.properties"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a> indicates that the default value for the property is UTF-8.</p>

<p>So why does Tapestry appear to botch the encoding when setting the property?</p>

<p>Relevant code follows:</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<p>@Jan Soltis: Well, if I inspect the value that comes from the database, it displays the correct string, so it would seem that my editor, OS and database are all encoding the value correctly. I've also checked my .application file; it does not contain an org.apache.tapestry.output-encoding entry, and the Tapestry 4 <a href=""http://tapestry.apache.org/tapestry4/UsersGuide/configuration.html#configuration.properties"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a> indicates that the default value for this property is UTF-8. I have updated the description above to reflect the answers to your questions.</p>

The company is rather small in size and has pretty strong ""start-up"" feel to it. I'm working as a Java developer on a team of 3 others. The company primarily sells a service to for businesses/business-type people to use in communicating with each other.</p>

<p>One of the main things I have been, and will be working on, is the main website for the company - from which the service is sold, existing users login to check their service and pay their bills, new users can sign up for a trial, etc. Currently this is a JSP application deployed on Tomcat, with access to a database done thru a persistence layer written by the company itself.</p>

<p>A repeated and growing frustration I am having here (and I'm pretty happy with the job overall, so this isn't an ""oh no I don't like my job""-type post) is the lack of any larger design or architecture for this web application. The app is made up of several dozen JSP pages, with almost no logic existing in Servlets or Beans or any other sort of framework. Many of the JSP pages are thousands of lines of code, they <code>jsp:include</code> other JSP pages, business logic is mixed in with the HTML, frequently used snippets of code (such as obtaining a web service connection) is cut and paste rather than reused, etc. In other words, the application is a mess.</p>

<p>There have been some rumblings within the company of trying to re-architect this site so that it fits MVC better; I think that the developers and higher-ups are beginning to realize that this current pattern of spaghetti code isn't sustainable or very easily scalable to add more features for the users. The higher-ups and developers are wary of completely re-writing the thing (with good reason, since this would mean several weeks or months of work re-writing existing functionality), but we've had some discussions of (slowly) re-writing certain areas of the site into a new framework.</p>

<p>What are some of the best strategies to enable moving the application and codebase into this direction? How can I as a developer really help move this along, and quickly, without seeming like the jerk-y new guy who comes into a job and tells everyone that what they've written is crap? Are there any proven strategies or experiences that you've used in your own job experience when you've encountered this sort of thing?</p>

Jsf is kind-of extremely painful for working with from designer's perspective, somewhat in the range of trying to draw a picture while having hands tied at your back, but it is good for chewing up forms and listing lots of data. So sites we are making in my company are jsf admin pages and jsp user pages. Problem occurs when user pages have some complicated forms and stuff and jsf starts kickin' in. </p>

<p>Here is the question: I'm on pure jsp page. I need to access some jsf page that uses session bean. How can I initialize that bean? If I was on jsf page, I could have some commandLink which would prepare data. Only thing I can come up with is having dummy jsf page that will do the work and redirect me to needed jsf page, but that's kind of ugly, and I don't want to end up with 50 dummy pages. I would rather find some mechanism to reinitialize bean that is already in session with some wanted parameters.</p>

<p>Edit: some more details. In this specific situation, I have a tests that are either full or filtered. It's a same test with same logic and everything, except if test is filtered, it should eliminate some questions depending on answers. Upon a clicking a link, it should start a requested test in one of the two modes. Links are parts of main menu-tree and are visible on many sibling jsp pages. My task is to have 4 links: testA full, testA filtered, testB full, testB filtered, that all lead on same jsf page and TestFormBean should be reinitialized accordingly.</p>

<p>Edit: I've researched facelets a bit, and while it won't help me now, I'll definitely keep that in mind for next project.</p>

The servers all use the same Oracle 9i database running on a 6th machine.</p>

<p>The application need to prefetch a batch of 100 IDs from a sequence. It's relatively easy to do in a single-threaded, non-distributed environment, you can just issue these queries:</p>

<pre><code>select seq.nextval from dual;
alter sequence seq increment by 100;
select seq.nextval from dual;
</code></pre>

<p>The first select fetches the first sequence ID that the application can use, the second select returns the last one that can be used.</p>

<p>Things get way more interesting in a multithreaded environment. You can't be sure that before the second select another thread doesn't increase the sequence by 100 again. This issue can be solved by synchronizing the access on the Java side - you only let one thread begin fetching the IDs at one time.</p>

<p>The situation becomes really hard when you can't synchronize because parts of the application doesn't run on the same JVM, not even on the same physical machine. I found some references on forums that others have problems with solving this problem too, but none of the answers are really working not to mention being reasonable.</p>

<p>Can the community provide a solution for this problem?</p>

<p>Some more information:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can't really play with the transaction isolation levels. I use JPA and the change would affect the entire application, not only the prefetching queries and that's not acceptable for me.</li>
<li><p>On PostgreSQL I could do the following:</p>

<p>select setval('seq', nextval('seq') + n - 1 )</p></li>
<li><p>The solution by Matthew works when you can use a fixed increment value (which is perfectly acceptable in my case). However is there a solution when you don't want to fix the size of the increment, but want to adjust it dynamically?</p></li>

<p>However, it does need to support inserts and updates as fast as possible. And since it is immutable, if I make a change to a node on the N'th level of the tree, I need to allocate at least N new nodes  in order to return the new tree.</p>

<p>My question is, would it be dramatically faster to pre-allocate nodes rather than create new ones every time the tree is modified? It would be fairly easy to do - keep a pool of several hundred unused nodes, and pull one out of the pool rather than create one whenever it was required for a modify operation. I can replenish the node pool when there's nothing else going on. (in case it isn't obvious, execution time is going to be much more at a premium in this application than heap space is)</p>

<p>Is it worthwhile to do this? Any other tips on speeding it up?</p>

<p>Alternatively, does anyone know if an immutable DOM library already? I searched, but couldn't find anything.</p>

<p>*Note: For those of you who aren't familiar with the concept of immutability, it basically means that on any operation to an object that changes it, the method returns a copy of the object with the changes in place, rather than the changed object. Thus, if another thread is still reading the object it will continue to happily operate on the ""old"" version, unaware that changes have been made, rather than crashing horribly.

The Java aspects of the code run the web UI and establish state on the devices that we're talking to, and the C++ code does the real-time crunching of data coming back from the devices. Shared memory is used to pass device state and context information from the Java code through to the C++ code. The Java code uses a PostgreSQL database to persist its state.</p>

<p>We're running into some pretty severe performance bottlenecks, and right now the only way we can scale is to increase memory and CPU counts. We're stuck on the one physical box due to the shared memory design.</p>

<p>If there's a free library out there that does this in a reliable, cross-platform manner, that would be great (even if it makes external calls or uses native code itself).</p>

<p>*<strong>*EDIT:</strong> To clarify, I would like to get the current CPU usage for the whole system, not just the Java process(es).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The SIGAR API provides all the functionality I'm looking for in one package, so it's the best answer to my question so far. However, due it being licensed under the GPL, I cannot use it for my original purpose (a closed source, commercial product). It's possible that Hyperic may license SIGAR for commercial use, but I haven't looked into it. For my GPL projects, I will definitely consider SIGAR in the future.</p>

<p>For my current needs, I'm leaning towards the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>for cpu usage, OperatingSystemMXBean.getSystemLoadAverage() / OperatingSystemMXBean.getAvailableProcessors() (load average per cpu)</li>
<li>for memory, OperatingSystemMXBean.getTotalPhysicalMemorySize() and OperatingSystemMXBean.getFreePhysicalMemorySize()</li>
<li>for disk space, File.getTotalSpace() and File.getUsableSpace()</li>
</ul>

<p>Limitations:</p>

<p>The getSystemLoadAverage() and disk space querying methods are only available under Java 6. Also, some JMX functionality may not be available to all platforms (i.e. it's been reported that getSystemLoadAverage() returns -1 on Windows).</p>

<p>In the C++ standard template library, iterators seem to represent a datatype or class the supports the operator++ and operator== but has <strong>no concept of a limit</strong> built in so comparison is required before advancing to the next item. The limit has to checked by the user comparing two iterators in the normal case the second iterator is the container end.</p>

So in my main table I could have a Note with id 4 and in my <code>NOTE_JOIN_TABLE</code> I would have two rows, <code>""foo""</code> and <code>""fizzbuzz""</code> that both have a relationship to the Note.</p>

<p>However, when one of these is inserted into the DB <strong>the larger substitution values are cropped to be as long as the shortest.</strong> So in this case I would have <code>""foo""</code> and <code>""fiz""</code> in the DB instead of <code>""foo""</code> and <code>""fizzbuzz""</code>.</p>

<p>Do you have any idea why this is happening? I have checked and confirmed they aren't being cropped anywhere in our code, it's defintely hibernate.</p>

<p>However you'll note that it never displays <code>parameter: 3</code> which is our clob.</p>

I've used whatever the default FTP client is in windows, FileZilla and lftp.  All without issue.  The servers themselves aren't the same FTP server software from what I can tell.  One is Microsoft FTP, the other I'm uncertain on but is definitely not Microsoft.</p>

<p>Any idea what could cause an FTP client to timeout when waiting for a NLST response on an empty directory?  The visible responses from the FTP server appear to be the same, but is there a difference in how NLST responds for an empty directory that I'm unaware of?</p>

<p>This problem is consistent on these two servers.  Everything functions fine on directories with files or subdirectories within it, but not when empty.</p>

<p>Any thoughts or directions would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<ol>
<li>Pushing data from the server to the client to be displayed.</li>
<li>Sending control information from the client to the server.</li>
<li>Callbacks from those control messages code paths that reach back from the server to the client (sidebar note - this is a side-effect of some legacy code and is not our long-term intent).</li>
</ol>

<p>What we would like to do is ensure that all of our RMI-related code will use only a known specified inventory of ports.  This includes the registry port (commonly expected to be 1099), the server port and any ports resulting from the callbacks.</p>

<p>Here is what we already know:</p>

<ol>
<li>LocateRegistry.getRegistry(1099) or Locate.createRegistry(1099) will ensure that the registry is listening in on 1099.</li>
<li>Using the UnicastRemoteObject constructor / exportObject static method with a port argument will specify the server port.</li>
</ol>

<p>These points are also covered in this <a href=""http://forums.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=370039&amp;messageID=1566073"" rel=""nofollow"">Sun forum post</a>. </p>

<p>What we don't know is: how do we ensure that the client connections back to the server resulting from the callbacks will only connect on a specified port rather than defaulting to an anonymous port?</p>

<p>EDIT: Added a longish answer summarizing my findings and how we solved the problem.  Hopefully, this will help anyone else with similar issues.</p>

<p>SECOND EDIT: It turns out that in my application, there seems to be a race condition in my creation and modification of socket factories.  I had wanted to allow the user to override my default settings in a Beanshell script.  Sadly, it appears that my script is being run significantly after the first socket is created by the factory.  As a result, I'm getting a mix of ports from the set of defaults and the user settings.  More work will be required that's out of the scope of this question but I thought I would point it out as a point of interest for others who might have to tread these waters at some point....</p>

import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.ManyToOne;

@Entity

    return id;
  }

  public void setId(long id) {

  }

  @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
  public Bar getBar() {
    return bar;
  }

  public void setBar(Bar bar) {
    this.bar = bar;
  }
}

package com.example.hibernate

import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;

import javax.persistence.Id;


public class Bar {
  private long id;
  private String title;

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)

  }


  public String getTitle() {
    return title;
  }

  public void setTitle(String title) {
    this.title = title;
  } 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now when we load from the database an object from class Foo using session get e.g:</p>

<p>Foo foo = (Foo)session.get(Foo.class, 1 /* or some other id that exists in the DB*/);
the Bar member of foo is a proxy object (in our case javassist proxy but it can be cglib one depending on the bytecode provider you use), that is not initialized.
If you then use session.get to fetch the Bar object that is the member of the Foo class just loaded (we are in the same session), Hibernate does not issue another DB query and fetches the object from the session (first level) cache. The problem is this is a proxy to Bar class which is not initialized and trying to call this object getId() will return 0, and getTitle() will return null. 
Our current solution is pretty ugly and checks if the object returned from get is a proxy here is the code (form a generic DAO implementation):</p>

<pre><code>@SuppressWarnings(""unchecked"")
@Override
@Transactional(readOnly = true)
public &lt;T extends IEntity&gt; T get(Class&lt;T&gt; clazz, Serializable primaryKey) throws DataAccessException {
  T entity = (T) currentSession().get(clazz, primaryKey);
  if (entity != null) {
    if (LOG.isWarnEnabled()) {
      LOG.warn(""Object not found for class "" + clazz.getName() + "" with primary key "" + primaryKey);
    }
  } else if (entity instanceof HibernateProxy){ // TODO: force initialization due to Hibernate bug
    HibernateProxy proxy = (HibernateProxy)entity;
    if (!Hibernate.isInitialized(proxy)) {
      Hibernate.initialize(proxy);
    }
    entity = (T)proxy.getHibernateLazyInitializer().getImplementation();
  }
  return entity;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a better way to do this, couldn't find a solution in the Hibernate forum, and didn't find the issue in Hibernate's JIRA.</p>

<p>Note: we cannot just use foo.getBar() (which will initialize the proxy properly) to get the Bar class object, because the session.get operation to fetch the Bar object does not know (or care for that matter) that the Bar class is also a lazy member of a Foo object that was just fetched.</p>

<p>As you can see, several prefixes are defined for the same namespace, e.g. the namespace <a href=""http://example.com/schema/common"">http://example.com/schema/common</a> has the prefixes ns4, ns5, ns6, ns7 and ns8. Some long requests define several hundred prefixes for the same namespace.</p>

<p>This causes a problem with the <a href=""http://saxon.sourceforge.net/"">Saxon</a> XSLT processor, that I use to transform the requests. Saxon limits the the number of different prefixes for the same namespace to 255 and throws an exception when you define more prefixes.</p>

<p>A little of background:</p>

<p>In my environment  I have about 50 client computers and 1 reasonably powerful SQL Server.</p>

<p>I have a desktop application in which all 50 clients are accessing the data at all times.</p>

<p>The project's Data Model has gone through a number of reorganizations for various reasons including clarity, efficiency, etc.</p>

<p>My Data Model's history</p>

<ol>
<li>JDBC calls directly</li>
<li>DAO + POJO without relations between Pojos (basically wrapping the JDBC). </li>
<li>Added Relations between POJOs implementing Lazy Loading, but just hiding the inter-DAO calls</li>
<li>Jumped onto the Hibernate bandwagon after seeing how ""simple"" it made data access (it made inter POJO relations trivial) and because it could decrease the number of round trips to the database when working with many related entities.</li>
<li>Since it was a desktop application keeping Sessions open long term was a nightmare so it ended up causing a whole lot of issues</li>
<li>Stepped back to a partial DAO/Hibernate approach that allows me to make direct JDBC calls behind the DAO curtain while at the same time using Hibernate.</li>

Jokes aside, there are a lot of tricks in Java that make testing a nightmare. Two of the most I hate are Anonymous Classes and Static Blocks. We have a lot of legacy code that make use of Static Blocks and these are one of the annoying points in our push in writing unit tests. Our goal is to be able to write unit tests for classes that depend on this static initialization with minimal code changes. </p>

<p>So far my suggestion to my colleagues is to move the body of the static block into a private static method and call it <code>staticInit</code>. This method can then be called from within the static block. For unit testing another class that depends on this class could easily mock <code>staticInit</code> with JMockit to not do anything. Let's see this in example.</p>

<pre><code>public class ClassWithStaticInit {
  static {
    System.out.println(""static initializer."");
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Will be changed to</p>

<pre><code>public class ClassWithStaticInit {
  static {
    staticInit();
  }

  private static void staticInit() {
    System.out.println(""static initialized."");
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So that we can do the following in a JUnit.</p>

<pre><code>public class DependentClassTest {
  public static class MockClassWithStaticInit {
    public static void staticInit() {
    }
  }

  @BeforeClass
  public static void setUpBeforeClass() {
    Mockit.redefineMethods(ClassWithStaticInit.class, MockClassWithStaticInit.class);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However this solution also comes with its own problems. You can't run <code>DependentClassTest</code> and <code>ClassWithStaticInitTest</code> on the same JVM since you actually want the static block to run for <code>ClassWithStaticInitTest</code>.</p>

<p>What would be your way of accomplishing this task? Or any better, non-JMockit based solutions that you think would work cleaner?</p>

Webapps?  </p>

<p>My boss is convinced that compiling our (<strong><em>my</em></strong>) webapp into a binary executable is a brilliant idea.  (Then again, he likes nice, small simple things with blinky lights that he can understand.)  He instinctively sees no issues with this, while I only see an endless series of problems and degradations.  Once I start talking to him about the complexity of our platform, and more in depth specifics of byte code, JVMs, libraries, differences between operating systems, processor architectures, etc...well...his eyes glaze over, he smiles and he has made it clear he thinks I'm being childishly resistive.</p>

<p>Why does he want a single magic executable?  He sees a couple of ""benefits"":</p>

<ul>
<li>If it is a binary executable, then it is hard to reverse engineer and circumvent any licensing.  Management lives in constant fear that this is happening, even though we sell into larger corporates who generally do not do cheat with server software.  </li>
<li>There is that vision of downloading this magic executable, running it, and everything works. (No more sending me out to do customer installations, which is not that frequent.)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, I've done my obligatory 20 minutes of googling, and now I am here.  </p>

<p>A bit of background on my application: </p>

<p><strong>What it is made from:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Java 6 (Sun's JVM)</li>
<li>AspectJ 1.6</li>
<li>Tomcat 6</li>
<li>Hibernate 3</li>
<li>Spring 2</li>
<li>another two dozen supporting jar files</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What it does</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A streaming media CMS</li>
<li>Performance sensitive</li>
<li>Deployed on Linux, Solaris, Windows (and developed on a Mac)</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can probably gather, I'm highly skeptical of this <em>""compiling Java to native code""</em> thing.  It sound like where Mono (VB on Linux) was back in 2000.  But am I being overly pessimistic?  Is it viable?  Should I actually spend the time (days if not weeks) to try this out?</p>

<p>There is one other similar thread (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/53845/java-compiler-options-to-produce-exe-files"">Java Compiler Options to produce .exe files</a>) but it is a bit too simple, the links dated, and not really geared towards a server-side question.</p>

<pre><code>http://server/application?source=123&amp;destination=234&amp;text=hello
</code></pre>

<p>This request contains the ID of the sender, the ID of the recipient and the text of the message.</p>

<p>This message should be processed like:</p>

<ul>
<li>finding the matching User object for both the source and the destination from the database</li>
<li>creating a tree of objects: a Message that contains a field for the message text and two User objects for the source and the destination</li>
<li>persisting this tree to a database.</li>
</ul>

<p>The tree will be loaded by other applications that I can't touch.</p>

<p>I use Oracle as the backing database and JPA with Toplink for the database handling tasks. If possible, I'd stay with these.</p>

<p>Without much optimization I can achieve ~30 requests/sec throughput in my environment. That's not much, I'd require ~300 requests/sec. So I measured where the performance bottleneck is and found that the calls to <code>em.persist()</code> takes most of the time. If I simply comment out that line, the throughput go well over 1000 requests/sec.</p>

<p>I tried to write a small test application that used simple JDBC calls to persist 1 million messages to the same database. I used batching, meaning I did 100 inserts then a commit, and repeated until all the records was in the database. I measured ~500 requests/sec throughput in this scenario, that would meet my needs.</p>

<p>It is clear that I need to optimize insert performance here. However as I mentioned earlier I would like to keep using JPA and Toplink for this, not pure JDBC.</p>

<p>Do you know a way to create batch inserts with JPA and Toplink? Can you recommend any other technique for improving JPA persist performance?</p>

<p>ADDITIONAL INFO:</p>

<p>""requests/sec"" means here: total number of requests / total time from beginning of test to last record written to database.</p>

<p>I tried to make the calls to <code>em.persist()</code> asynchronous by creating an in-memory queue between the servlet stuff and the persister. It helped the performance greatly. However the queue did grow really fast and as the application will receive ~200 requests/second continuously, It is not an acceptable solution for me.</p>

<p>In this decoupled approach I collected requests for 100 msec and called <code>em.persist()</code> on all collected items before commiting the transaction. The EntityManagerFactory is cached between each transaction.</p>

John Wayne, Marion Robert Morrison, male, Winterset, 156.35
Spiderman, Peter Parker, male, New York, -0.96
</code></pre>

<p>And want to produce the following XML.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""no""?&gt;
&lt;records&gt;
    &lt;record&gt;
        &lt;field name=""stageName""&gt;John Wayne&lt;/field&gt;

    &lt;/record&gt;
&lt;/records&gt;

<p>Your Java/Data Pipeline code would be:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) throws Throwable {
    String in = ""example/data/input/WriteCsvToXmlUsingFreeMarkerTemplates.csv"";
    String out = ""example/data/output/WriteCsvToXmlUsingFreeMarkerTemplates.xml"";

    DataReader reader = new CSVReader(new File(in))
        .setFieldNamesInFirstRow(true);

    TemplateWriter writer = new TemplateWriter(new FileWriter(out));
    writer.setFieldNamesInFirstRow(false);
    writer.getConfiguration().setDirectoryForTemplateLoading(new File(""example/data/input""));
    writer.setHeaderTemplate(""WriteAnXmlFileUsingFreeMarkerTemplates-header-2.xml"");

    writer.setDetailTemplate(""WriteAnXmlFileUsingFreeMarkerTemplates-detail-2.xml"");

    JobTemplate.DEFAULT.transfer(reader, writer);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, here's what the template files would contain.</p>

<p><strong>WriteAnXmlFileUsingFreeMarkerTemplates-header-2.xml:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""no""?&gt;
&lt;records&gt;

<p><strong>WriteAnXmlFileUsingFreeMarkerTemplates-footer-2.xml:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;record&gt;
        &lt;#list record.fieldNames as fieldName&gt;
        &lt;field name=""${fieldName}""&gt;${record.getField(fieldName).getValue()}&lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;/#list&gt;
&lt;/record&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>WriteAnXmlFileUsingFreeMarkerTemplates-detail-2.xml:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;/records&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Another option for the detail template file would be to use specific tags:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;actor stage-name=""${stageName}"" real-name=""${realName}""&gt;
        &lt;gender&gt;${gender}&lt;/gender&gt;
        &lt;city&gt;${city}&lt;/city&gt;
        &lt;#if (balance &gt;= 0)&gt;
                &lt;balance&gt;${balance}&lt;/balance&gt;
        &lt;/#if&gt;          
&lt;/actor&gt;

Granted, the title is for shock value, but the author makes valid points.</p>

<p>Essentially, if you have getters and setters for each and every private field, you are making those fields as good as public. You'd be very hard-pressed to change the type of a private field without ripple effects to every class that calls that getter.</p>

<p>Moreover, from a strictly OO point of view, objects should be responding to messages (methods) that correspond to their (hopefully) single responsibility. The vast majority of getters and setters don't make sense for their constituent objects; Pen.dispenseInkOnto(Surface) makes more sense to me than Pen.getColor().</p>

<p>Getters and setters also encourage users of the class to ask the object for some data, perform a calculation, and then set some other value in the object, better known as procedural programming. You'd be better served to simply tell the object to do what you were going to in the first place; also known as the <a href=""http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~gpollice/cs4233-a05/CourseNotes/maps/class4/InformationExpert.html"">Information Expert</a> idiom.</p>

<p>Getters and setters, however, are necessary evils at the boundary of layers -- UI, persistence, and so forth. Restricted access to a class's internals, such as C++'s friend keyword, Java's package protected access, .NET's internal access, and the <a href=""http://moffdub.wordpress.com/2008/09/17/friend-classes-in-java-and-c-sharp/"">Friend Class Pattern</a> can help you reduce the visibility of getters and setters to only those who need them.</p>

<p>int is one of the few primitives in Java (along with char and some others).

So Integer is a fancy way to work with an int (Just as perhaps String is a fancy way to work with a group of chars).</p>

<p>Java 5 onwards have something called <em>auto-boxing</em> and <em>auto-unboxing</em> which allow the boxing/unboxing to be done behind the scenes. Compare and contrast: Java 5 version:</p>

<pre><code>Deque&lt;Integer&gt; queue;<br><br>void add(int n) {<br>    queue.add(n);<br>}<br><br>int remove() {<br>    return queue.remove();<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>Java 1.4 or earlier (no generics either):</p>

<pre><code>Deque queue;<br><br>void add(int n) {<br>    queue.add(Integer.valueOf(n));<br>}<br><br>int remove() {<br>    return ((Integer) queue.remove()).intValue();<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>It must be noted that despite the brevity in the Java 5 version, both versions generate identical bytecode. Thus, although auto-boxing and auto-unboxing is very convenient because you write less code, these operations <em>do</em> happen behind the scenes, with the same runtime costs, so you still have to be aware of their existence.</p>

<p>Correct: int is an alias for System.Int32. <br>
Wrong: float is not an alias for System.Float, but for System.Single</p>

<p>Basically, int is a reserved keyword in the C# programming language, and is an alias for the System.Int32 value type.</p>

<p>float and Float is not the same however, as the right system type for ''float'' is System.Single. There are some types like this that has reserved keywords that doesn't seem to match the type names directly.</p>

<p>In C# there is no difference between ''int'' and ''System.Int32'', or any of the other pairs or keywords/system types, except for when defining enums. With enums you can specify the storage size to use and in this case you can only use the reserved keyword, and not the system runtime type name.</p>

<p>Wether the value in the int will be stored on the stack, in memory, or as a referenced heap object depends on the context and how you use it.</p>

<p>This declaration in a method:</p>

<pre><code>int i;<br></code></pre>

<p>defines a variable <em>i</em> of type System.Int32, living in a register or on the stack, depending on optimizations. The same declaration in a type (struct or class) defines a member field. The same declaration in a method argument list defines a parameter, with the same storage options as for a local variable. (note that this paragraph is not valid if you start pulling iterator methods into the mix, these are different beasts altogether)</p>

<p>To get a heap object, you can use boxing:</p>

<pre><code>object o = i;<br></code></pre>

<p>this will create a boxed copy of the contents of <em>i</em> on the heap. In IL you can access methods on the heap object directly, but in C# you need to cast it back to an int, which will create another copy. Thus, the object on the heap cannot easily be changed in C# without creating a new boxed copy of a new int value. (Ugh, this paragraph doesn't read all that easily.)</p>",,NULL,@

<p>In Java, Integer objects with the values -128 to 127 are immutable (that is, for one particular integer value, say 23, all Integer objects instantiated through your program with the value 23 points to the <em>exact</em> same object).</p>

<p>Example, this returns true:</p>

<pre><code>Integer i1 = new Integer(127);<br>Integer i2 = new Integer(127);<br>System.out.println(i1 == i2); //  true<br></code></pre>

<p>While this returns false:</p>

<pre><code>Integer i1 = new Integer(128);<br>Integer i2 = new Integer(128);<br>System.out.println(i1 == i2); //  false<br></code></pre>

<p>The == compares by reference (does the variables point to the same object).</p>

<p>This result may or may not differ depending on what JVM you are using. The specification autoboxing for Java 1.5 requires that integers (-128 to 127) always box to the same wrapper object. </p>

<p>A solution? =) One should always use the Integer.equals() method when comparing Integer objects.</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println(i1.equals(i2)); //  true<br></code></pre>

<p>Primitive values do not share state with other primitive values. A variable whose type is a primitive type always holds a primitive value of that type.</p>

<pre><code>int aNumber = 4;
int anotherNum = aNumber;
aNumber += 6;
System.out.println(anotherNum); // Prints 4
</code></pre>

<p>An object is a dynamically created class instance or an array. The reference values (often just references) are pointers to these objects and a special null reference, which refers to no object. There may be many references to the same object.</p>

<pre><code>Integer aNumber = Integer.valueOf(4);
Integer anotherNumber = aNumber; // anotherNumber references the 
                                 // same object as aNumber
</code></pre>

<p>Also in Java everything is passed by value. With objects the value that is passed is the reference to the object. So another difference between int and Integer in java is how they are passed in method calls. For example in</p>

<pre><code>public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
final int two = 2;
int sum = add(1, two);
</code></pre>

<p>The variable <em>two</em> is passed as the primitive integer type 2. Whereas in</p>

<pre><code>public int add(Integer a, Integer b) {
    return a.intValue() + b.intValue();
}
final Integer two = Integer.valueOf(2);
int sum = add(Integer.valueOf(1), two);
</code></pre>

<p>The variable <em>two</em> is passed as a reference to an object that holds the integer value 2.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>@WolfmanDragon:
Pass by reference would work like so:</p>

<pre><code>public void increment(int x) {
  x = x + 1;
}
int a = 1;
increment(a);
// a is now 2
</code></pre>

<p>When increment is called it passes a reference (pointer) to variable <em>a</em>. And the <em>increment</em> function directly modifies variable <em>a</em>.</p>

<p>And for object types it would work as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public void increment(Integer x) {
  x = Integer.valueOf(x.intValue() + 1);
}
Integer a = Integer.valueOf(1);
increment(a);
// a is now 2
</code></pre>

<p>Do you see the difference now?</p>

<p>Note that by overriding <strong>paintComponent</strong> that the contents of the button can be changed, but that the border is painted by the <strong>paintBorder</strong> method. The <strong>getPreferredSize</strong> method also needs to be managed in order to dynamically support changes to the content. Care needs to be taken when measuring font metrics and image dimensions.</p>

<p>For creating a control that you can rely on, the above code is not the correct approach. Dimensions and colours are dynamic in Swing and are dependent on the look and feel being used. Even the default <em>Metal</em> look has changed across JRE versions. It would be better to implement <strong>AbstractButton</strong> and conform to the guidelines set out by the Swing API. A good starting point is to look at the <strong>javax.swing.LookAndFeel</strong> and <strong>javax.swing.UIManager</strong> classes.</p>

<p>The amount of space you have to work with when drawing your button is defined by getPreferredSize(), assuming getMinimumSize() and getMaximumSize() return the same value.

  <p>How do I figure out what the configuration settings (e.g. baud rate) should be...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read the datasheet? Ok, ok. Seriously, last one. If you don't know the baud rate of the device you are trying to communicate with, you have two choices. Start guessing, or possibly bust out an o-scope. If you need a good starting point, let me suggest 9600-8-N-1. My suspicion is you can get there with brute force relatively quickly. There's a third option of having an old-school ninja who can tell just by the LOOK of the garbled characters at some standard baud rate what actual baud rate is. An impressive party trick to be sure.</p>

<p>Hopefully though you have access to this information. In unix/linux, you can get ahold of minicom to play with the serial port directly. This should make it fairly quick to get the configuration figured out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>one of the major Unix shells</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Unix the serial port(s) is/are file-mapped into the /dev/ subdir. ttyS0, for example. If you setup the correct baud rate and whatnot using minicom, you can even cat stuff to that file to send stuff out there.</p>

<p>On to the meat of the question, you can access it programmatically through the POSIX headers. termios.h is the big one. </p>

<p>First, the <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html"">NPE JavaDoc</a> explicitly lists the cases where NPE is appropriate.  Notice that all of them are thrown <i>by the runtime</i> when <code>null</code> is used inappropriately.  In contrast, the <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/IllegalArgumentException.html"">IAE JavaDo</a>c couldn't be more clear: ""Thrown to indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument.""  Yup, that's you!</p>

<p>Second, when you see an NPE in a stack trace, what do you assume?  Probably that someone dereferenced a null.  When you see IAE, you assume the caller of the method at the top of the stack passed in an illegal value.  Again, the latter assumption is true, the former is misleading.</p>

<p>Third, since IAE is clearly designed for validating parameters, you have to assume it as the default choice of exception, so why would you choose NPE instead?  Certainly not for different behavior -- do you really expect calling code to catch NPE's separately from IAE and do something different as a result?  Are you trying to communicate a more specific error message?  But you can do that in the exception message text anyway, as you should for all other incorrect parameters.</p>

<p>Fourth, all other incorrect parameter data will be IAE, so why not be consistent?  Why is it that an illegal <code>null</code> is so special that it deserves a separate exception from all other types of illegal arguments?</p>

<p>Finally, I accept the argument given by other answers that parts of the Java API use NPE in this manner.  However, the Java API is inconsistent with everything from exception types to naming conventions, so I think just blindly copying (your favorite part) of the Java API isn't a good enough argument to trump these other considerations.</p>

<ul>
<li>It is more specific about the nature of the illegal operation</li>
<li>Logic that mistakenly allows nulls tends to be very different from logic that mistakenly allows illegal values. For example, if I'm validating data entered by a user, if I get value that is unacceptable, the source of that error is with the end user of the application. If I get a null, that's programmer error.</li>
<li>Invalid values can cause things like stack overflows, out of memory errors, parsing exceptions, etc. Indeed, most errors generally present, at some point, as an invalid value in some method call. For this reason I see IAE as actually the <em>MOST GENERAL</em> of all exceptions under RuntimeException.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Actually, other invalid arguments can result in all kinds of other exceptions. <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/UnknownHostException.html"">UnknownHostException</a>, <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/FileNotFoundException.html"">FileNotFoundException</a>, a variety of syntax error exceptions, <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/IndexOutOfBoundsException.html"">IndexOutOfBoundsException</a>, authentication failures, etc., etc.</p></li>

That, plus the JDK's failure to populate NPE's with a message string really has created a strong negative sentiment that isn't well founded.

Provided you call a method quickly (i.e. fail fast), then you have essentially the same effect, just not quite as user friendly for the developer.

In general, the rules are simple, and as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>argument constraint violations must be indicated as fast as possible (-> fast fail), in order to avoid illegal states which are much harder to debug</li>
<li>in case of an invalid null pointer for whatever reason, throw NullPointerException</li>
<li>in case of an illegal array/collection index, throw ArrayIndexOutOfBounds</li>
<li>in case of a negative array/collection size, throw NegativeArraySizeException</li>
<li>in case of an illegal argument that is not covered by the above, and for which you don't have another more specific exception type, throw IllegalArgumentException as a wastebasket</li>
<li>on the other hand, in case of a constraint violation WITHIN A FIELD that could not be avoided by fast fail for some valid reason, catch and rethrow as IllegalStateException or a more specific checked exception. Never let pass the original NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBounds, etc in this case!</li>
</ul>

<p>There are at least three very good reasons against the case of mapping all kinds of argument constraint violations to IllegalArgumentException, with the third probably being so severe as to mark the practice bad style:</p>

<p>(1) A programmer cannot a safely assume that all cases of argument constraint violations result in IllegalArgumentException, because the large majority of standard classes use this exception rather as a wastebasket if there is no more specific kind of exception available. Trying to map all cases of argument constraint violations to IllegalArgumentException in your API only leads to programmer frustration using your classes, as the standard libraries mostly follow different rules that violate yours, and most of your API users will use them as well!</p>

<p>(2) Mapping the exceptions actually results in a different kind of anomaly, caused by single inheritance: All Java exceptions are classes, and therefore support single inheritance only. Therefore, there is no way to create an exception that is truly say both a NullPointerException and an IllegalArgumentException, as subclasses can only inherit from one or the other. Throwing an IllegalArgumentException in case of a null argument therefore makes it harder for API users to distinguish between problems whenever a program tries to programmatically correct the problem, for example by feeding default values into a call repeat!</p>

<p>(3) Mapping actually creates the danger of bug masking: In order to map argument constraint violations into IllegalArgumentException, you'll need to code an outer try-catch within every method that has any constrained arguments. However, simply catching RuntimeException in this catch block is out of the question, because that risks mapping documented RuntimeExceptions thrown by libery methods used within yours into IllegalArgumentException, even if they are no caused by argument constraint violations. So you need to be very specific, but even that effort doesn't protect you from the case that you accidentally map an undocumented runtime exception of another API (i.e. a bug) into an IllegalArgumentException of your API. Even the most careful mapping therefore risks masking programming errors of other library makers as argument constraint violations of your method's users, which is simply hillareous behavior!</p>

<p><p>CPD is the PMD ""Copy/Paste Detector"" tool. I was using PMD for a little while before I noticed the <a href=""http://pmd.sourceforge.net/cpd.html"">""Finding Duplicated Code"" link</a> on the <a href=""http://pmd.sourceforge.net"">PMD web page</a>.</p>

<p><p>I'd like to point out that these tools can sometimes be extended beyond their ""out-of-the-box"" set of rules. And not just because they're open source so that you can rewrite them. Some of these tools come with applications or ""hooks"" that allow them to be extended. For example, PMD comes with the <a href=""http://pmd.sourceforge.net/howtowritearule.html"">""designer"" tool</a> that allows you to create new rules. Also, Checkstyle has the <a href=""http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_misc.html#DescendantToken"">DescendantToken</a> check that has properties that allow for substantial customization.</p>

<p><p>I integrate these tools with <a href=""http://virtualteamtls.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/virtualteamtls/trunk/scm/common.xml?view=markup"">an Ant-based build</a>. You can follow the link to see my commented configuration.</p>

<p><p>In addition to the simple integration into the build, I find it helpful to configure the tools to be somewhat ""integrated"" in a couple of other ways. Namely, report generation and warning suppression uniformity. I'd like to add these aspects to this discussion (which should probably have the ""static-analysis"" tag also): how are folks configuring these tools to create a ""unified"" solution? (I've asked this question separately <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/79918/configuring-static-analysis-tools-for-uniformity"">here</a>)</p>

<p><p>First, for warning reports, I transform the output so that each warning has the simple format:</p>

<pre><code>/absolute-path/filename:line-number:column-number: warning(tool-name): message</code></pre>

<p><p>This is often called the ""Emacs format,"" but even if you aren't using Emacs, it's a reasonable format for homogenizing reports. For example:</p>

<pre><code>/project/src/com/example/Foo.java:425:9: warning(Checkstyle):Missing a Javadoc comment.</code></pre>

<p><p>My warning format transformations are done by my Ant script with Ant <a href=""http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/filterchain.html"">filterchains</a>.</p>

<p><p>The second ""integration"" that I do is for warning suppression. By default, each tool supports comments or an annotation (or both) that you can place in your code to silence a warning that you want to ignore. But these various warning suppression requests do not have a consistent look which seems somewhat silly. When you're suppressing a warning, you're suppressing a warning, so why not always write ""<code>SuppressWarning</code>?""</p>

<p><p>For example, PMD's default configuration suppresses warning generation on lines of code with the string ""<code>NOPMD</code>"" in a comment. Also, PMD supports Java's <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation. I configure PMD to use comments containing ""<code>SuppressWarning(PMD.</code>"" instead of <code>NOPMD</code> so that PMD suppressions look alike. I fill in the particular rule that is violated when using the comment style suppression:</p>

<pre><code>// SuppressWarnings(PMD.PreserveStackTrace) justification: (false positive) exceptions are chained</code></pre>

<p><p>Only the ""<code>SuppressWarnings(PMD.</code>"" part is significant for a comment, but it is consistent with PMD's support for the <code>@SuppressWarning</code> annotation which does recognize individual rule violations by name:</p>

<pre><code>@SuppressWarnings(""PMD.CompareObjectsWithEquals"") // justification: identity comparision intended</code></pre>

<p><p>Similarly, Checkstyle suppresses warning generation between pairs of comments (no annotation support is provided). By default, comments to turn Checkstyle off and on contain the strings <code>CHECKSTYLE:OFF</code> and <code>CHECKSTYLE:ON</code>, respectively. Changing this configuration (with Checkstyle's ""SuppressionCommentFilter"") to use the strings ""<code>BEGIN&nbsp;SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.</code>"" and ""<code>END&nbsp;SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.</code>"" makes the controls look more like PMD:</p>

<pre>
<code>// BEGIN SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField) justification: ""Effective Java,"" 2nd ed., Bloch, Item 2</code>
<code>// END SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField)</code>
</pre>

<p><p>With Checkstyle comments, the particular check violation (<code>HiddenField</code>) <em>is</em> significant because each check has its own ""<code>BEGIN/END</code>"" comment pair.</p>

<p><p>FindBugs also supports warning generation suppression with a <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation, so no further configuration is required to achieve some level of uniformity with other tools. Unfortunately, Findbugs has to support a custom <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation because the built-in Java <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation has a <code>SOURCE</code> retention policy which is not strong enough to retain the annotation in the class file where FindBugs needs it. I fully qualify FindBugs warnings suppressions to avoid clashing with Java's <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation:</p>

<pre><code>@edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressWarnings(""UWF&#95;FIELD&#95;NOT&#95;INITIALIZED&#95;IN&#95;CONSTRUCTOR"")</code></pre>

<p><p>These techniques makes things look reasonably consistent across tools. Note that having each warning suppression contain the string ""<code>SuppressWarnings</code>"" makes it easy to run a simple search to find all instances for all tools over an entire code base.</p>

<p>Loading libA before libB should work, unless one of those libraries has a dependency that is unaccounted for and not in the path. My understanding is that once it gets to a system loadLibrary call (i.e. Java has found the library in its java.library.path and is now telling the OS to load it) - it is completely dependent on the operating system to find any dependent libraries, because at that point it is the operating system that is loading the library for the process, and the OS only knows how to look in the system path. That seems hard to set in the case of a Webstart app, but there is a way around this that does not involve static compiling. You may be able to shuffle where your libraries are - I am unsure </p>

<p>If you use a custom classloader, you can override loadLibrary and findLibrary so that it can locate your libraries from within a jar in your classpath, and if you also make it aware of your native library dependencies (i.e. libB depends on libA depends on libX, then when loading libB you can catch yourself and ensure you load libA first, and in checking that notice and load libX first. Then the OS doesn't try to find a library that isn't in your path. It's klunky and a bit painful, but ensuring Java finds them and loads them all in the correct order can work.</p>",,NULL,@

In my experience, there are two key things that can help keep your personal server secure enough to throw up on the internet while retaining your sanity:</p>

<p><strong>1) Security through obscurity</strong></p>

<p>Needless to say, relying on this in the 'real world' is a bad idea and not to be entertained. But that's because in the real world,  baddies know what's there and that there's loot to be had.</p>

<p>On a personal server, the majority of 'attacks' you'll suffer will simply be automated sweeps from machines that have already been compromised, looking for default installations of products known to be vulnerable. If your server doesn't offer up anything enticing on the default ports or in the default locations, the automated attacker will move on. Therefore, if you're going to run a ssh server, put it on a non-standard port (>1024) and it's likely it will never be found. If you can get away with this technique for your web server then great, shift that to an obscure port too.</p>

<p><strong>2) Package management</strong></p>

<p>Don't compile and install Apache or sshd from source yourself unless you absolutely have to. If you do, you're taking on the responsibility of keeping up-to-date with the latest security patches. Let the nice package maintainers from Linux distros such as Debian or Ubuntu do the work for you. Install from the distro's precompiled packages, and staying current becomes a matter of issuing the occasional <em>apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get -u dist-upgrade</em> command, or using whatever fancy GUI tool Ubuntu provides.</p>

Perhaps, somehow, my understanding of why this cannot be done contributes to the discussion and to future readers of your interesting question.</p>

<p>Let me start with an example of failing object construction.</p>

<p>Let's define a class A, such that:</p>

<pre><code>class A {
   private String a = ""A"";

   public A() throws Exception {
        throw new Exception();
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let's assume we would like to create an object of type A in a <code>try...catch</code> block.</p>

<pre><code>A a = null;
try{
  a = new A();
}catch(Exception e) {
  //...
}
System.out.println(a);
</code></pre>

<p>Evidently, the output of this code will be: <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>Why Java does not return a partially constructed version of A? After all, by the point the constructor fails its <code>name</code> field member has already being initialized, right?</p>

<p>Java does not do that because the object was not successfully built. The object is in a inconsistent state, and it is therefore discarded by Java. Your variable A is not even initialized, it is kept as null. </p>

<p>Now, as you know, to fully build a new object, all its super classes must be initialized first. If one of the super classes failed to build, what would be the final state of the object? It is impossible to determine that.</p>

<p>Look at this more elaborate example</p>

<pre><code>class A {
   private final int a;
   public A() throws Exception { 
      a = 10;
   }
}

class B extends A {
   private final int b;
   public B() throws Exception {
       methodThatThrowsException(); 
       b = 20;
   }
}

class C extends B {
   public C() throws Exception { super(); }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When the constructor of <code>C</code> is invoked, if an exception occurs on initializing <code>B</code>, what would be the value of the final variable <code>int b</code>?</p>

<p>As such, the object C cannot be created, it is bogus, it is trash, it is not fully initialized.</p>

<p>For me, this explains why your code is illegal.</p>

<p>Use one of these two methods:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getResource%28java.lang.String%29""><code>Class.getResource(String)</code></a></li>
<li><a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getResourceAsStream%28java.lang.String%29""><code>Class.getResourceAsStream(String)</code></a></li>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>InputStream inputStream = 
                YourClass.class.getResourceAsStream(""image.jpg"");
</code></pre>

<p>--</p>

<p><strong>The long answer</strong></p>

<p>Typically, one would not want to load files using absolute paths. For example, don’t do this if you can help it:</p>

<pre><code>File file = new File(""C:\\Users\\Joe\\image.jpg"");
</code></pre>

<p>This technique is not recommended for at least two reasons. First, it creates a dependency on a particular operating system, which prevents the application from easily moving to another operating system. One of Java’s main benefits is the ability to run the same bytecode on many different platforms. Using an absolute path like this makes the code much less portable.</p>

<p>Second, depending on the relative location of the file, this technique might create an external dependency and limit the application’s mobility. If the file exists outside the application’s current directory, this creates an external dependency and one would have to be aware of the dependency in order to move the application to another machine (error prone).</p>

<p>Instead, use the <code>getResource()</code> methods in the <code>Class</code> class. This makes the application much more portable. It  can be moved to different platforms, machines, or directories and still function correctly.</p>

<p>TestNG has a neat feature where you can mark tests as a particular group, and then easily run all tests of a specific group, or exclude tests of a particular group.  Thus you can mark tests that run slowly as in the ""slow"" group and then ignore them when you want quick results.  A suggestion from their documentation is to mark some subset as ""checkin"" tests which should be run whenever you check new files in.  I never saw such a feature in JUnit, but then again, if you don't have it, you don't REALLY miss it.</p>

<p>1) The most frequent thing I use TestNG's groups for is when I want to run a single test method in a test suite.  I simply add this test to the group ""phil"" and then run this group.  When I was using JUnit 3, I would comment out the entries for all methods but the one I wanted to run in the ""suite"" method, but then would commonly forget to uncomment them before checkin.  With the groups, I no longer have this problem.</p>

<p>2) Depending on the complexity of the tests, migrating tests from JUnit3 to TestNG can be done somewhat automatically with sed and creating a base class to replace TestCase that static imports all of the TestNG assert methods.</p>

So the first public, static annotated method that it finds will be used, but it may find them in any order. This causes us to write different classes unnecessarily. However TestNG provides clean way to provide different kind of data providers for each and every method.

On one had you would like to compare two test frameworks, on the other hand you would like to implement tests easily, have natural assertions, etc...</p>

<p>Ok, firstly JUnit has been playing catchup with TestNG in terms of functionality, they have bridged the gap some what with v4, but not well enough in my opinion. Things like annotations and dataproviders are still much better in TestNG. Also they are more flexible in terms of test execution, since TestNG has test dependency, grouping and ordering.</p>

<p>JUnit still requires certain before/after methods to be static, which limits what you can do prior to the running of tests, TestNG never has this issue.</p>

<p>TBH, mostly the differences between the two frameworks don't mean much, unless your focusing on integration/automation testing. JUnit from my experience is built from the ground up for unit testing and is now being pushed towards higher levels of testing, which IMO makes it the wrong tool for the job. TestNG does well at unit testing and due to its robust dataproviding and great test execution abilities, works even better at integration/automation test level.</p>

<p>Now for what I believe is a separate issue, how to write well structured, readable and maintainable tests. Most of this I am sure you know, but things like <strong>Factory Pattern</strong>, <strong>Command Pattern</strong> and <strong>PageObjects</strong> (if your testing websites) are vital, it is very important to have a layer of abstraction between what your testing (SUT) and what the actual test is (assertions of business logic). In order to have much nicer assertions, you can use <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""hamcrest"">Hamcrest</a>. Make use of javas inheritance/interfaces to reduce repetition and enforce commonality.</p>

<p>Almost forgot, also use the <strong>Test Data Builder Pattern</strong>, this coupled with TestNG's dataprovider annotation is very useful.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks for you answer. It makes sense. Can you please explain me MathContext in the context of BigDecimal#round method.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's nothing special about <code>BigDecimal.round()</code> <em>vs.</em> any other <code>BigDecimal</code> method.  In all cases, the <code>MathContext</code> specifies the number of significant digits and the rounding technique.  Basically, there are two parts of every <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/math/MathContext.html""><code>MathContext</code></a>.  There's a precision, and there's also a <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/math/RoundingMode.html""><code>RoundingMode</code></a>.</p>

<p>The precision again specifies the number of significant digits.  So if you specify <code>123</code> as a number, and ask for 2 significant digits, you're going to get <code>120</code>.  It might be clearer if you think in terms of scientific notation.</p>

<p><code>123</code> would be <code>1.23e2</code> in scientific notation.  If you only keep 2 significant digits, then you get <code>1.2e2</code>, or <code>120</code>.  By reducing the number of significant digits, we reduce the precision with which we can specify a number.</p>

<p>The <code>RoundingMode</code> part specifies how we should handle the loss of precision.  To reuse the example, if you use <code>123</code> as the number, and ask for 2 significant digits, you've reduced your precision.  With a <code>RoundingMode</code> of <code>HALF_UP</code> (the default mode), <code>123</code> will become <code>120</code>.  With a <code>RoundingMode</code> of <code>CEILING</code>, you'll get <code>130</code>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println(new BigDecimal(""123.4"",
                   new MathContext(4,RoundingMode.HALF_UP)));
System.out.println(new BigDecimal(""123.4"",
                   new MathContext(2,RoundingMode.HALF_UP)));
System.out.println(new BigDecimal(""123.4"",
                   new MathContext(2,RoundingMode.CEILING)));
System.out.println(new BigDecimal(""123.4"",
                   new MathContext(1,RoundingMode.CEILING)));
</code></pre>

<p>Outputs:</p>

<pre><code>123.4
1.2E+2
1.3E+2
2E+2
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that both the precision and the rounding mode affect the output.</p>

<p>Generally don't sweat it until you get to a point where it is becoming overwhelming and bloated. Then sit down and don't code, just refactor the classes out, compiling regularly to make sure everything works. Then continue as you did before.</p>

<p>Usually the top of your package tree is your domain name reversed (<code>com.domain.subdomain</code>) to guarantee uniqueness, and then usually there will be a package for your application. Then subdivide that by related area, so your <code>FileStorageStrategy</code> might go in, say, <code>com.domain.subdomain.myapp.storage</code>, and then there might be specific implementations/subclasses/whatever in <code>com.domain.subdomain.myapp.storage.file</code> and <code>com.domain.subdomain.myapp.storage.database</code>. These names can get pretty long, but <code>import</code> keeps them all at the top of files and IDEs can help to manage that as well.</p>

<p>Exceptions usually go in the same package as the classes that throw them, so if you had, say, <code>FileStorageException</code> it would go in the same package as <code>FileStorageStrategy</code>. Likewise an interface defining constants would be in the same package.</p>

If I'm not extending something I just go with what is simplest. com.mydomain.domain for Domain Objects (although if you have a ton of domain objects this package could get a bit unwieldy).
For domain specific constants, I actually put them as public constants in the most related class. For example, if I have a ""Member"" class and have a maximum member name length constant, I put it in the Member class. Some shops make a separate Constants class but I don't see the value in lumping unrelated numbers and strings into a single class. I've seen some other shops try to solve this problem by creating SEPARATE Constants classes, but that just seems like a waste of time and the result is too confusing.

<p>One of the key ideas for me is to have two source roots - one for production code and one for test code like so:</p>

<pre><code>MyProject/src/main/java/com/acme/Widget.java
MyProject/src/test/java/com/acme/WidgetTest.ava
</code></pre>

<p>(here, both src/main/java and src/test/java are source roots).</p>

<p>Advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your tests have package (or ""default"") level access to your classes under test.</li>
<li>You can easily package only your production sources into a JAR by dropping src/test/java as a source root.</li>

<p>Generally speaking, well structured projects will be free of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_dependency"">circular dependencies</a>.

Then use a structure like <em>com.mycompany.myapp.somemodule.somelayer</em>, e.g. <em>com.mycompany.myapp.client.view</em> or <em>com.mycompany.myapp.server.model</em>.</p>

<p>Using the top level of packages for application <em>modules</em>, in the old-fashioned computer-science sense of modular programming, ought to be obvious. However, on most of the projects I have worked on we end up forgetting to do that, and end up with a mess of packages without that top-level structure. This anti-pattern usually shows itself as a package for something like 'listeners' or 'actions' that groups otherwise unrelated classes simply because they happen to implement the same interface.</p>

<p>Within a module, or in a small application, use packages for the application layers. Likely packages include things like the following, depending on the architecture:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.view</em></li>
<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.model</em></li>
<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.services</em></li>
<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.rules</em></li>
<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.persistence</em> (or 'dao' for data access layer)</li>
<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.util</em> (beware of this being used as if it were 'misc')</li>
</ul>

<p>Within each of these layers, it is natural to group classes by type if there are a lot. A common anti-pattern here is to unnecessarily introduce too many packages and levels of sub-package so that there are only a few classes in each package.</p>

The goal was to obtain a good separation of concerns, thus we defined a project structure using multiple modules (one for each application 'layer'):
  - common: common code used by the other layers (e.g., i18n)
  - entities: the domain entities
  - repositories: this module contains the daos interfaces and implementations
  - services-intf: interfaces for the services (e.g, UserService, ...) 
  - services-impl: implementations of the services (e.g, UserServiceImpl) 
  - web: everything regarding the web content (e.g., css, jsps, jsf pages, ...)
  - ws: web services</p>

<p>Each module has its own dependencies (e.g., repositories could have jpa) and some are project wide (thus they belong in the common module). Dependencies between the different project modules clearly separate things (e.g., the web layer depends on the service layer but doesn't know about the repository layer).</p>

<p>Each module has its own base package, for example if the application package is ""com.foo.bar"", then we have:</p>

<pre><code>com.foo.bar.common
com.foo.bar.entities
com.foo.bar.repositories
com.foo.bar.services
com.foo.bar.services.impl
...
</code></pre>

<p>Each module respects the standard maven project structure:</p>

<pre><code>   src\
   ..main\java
     ...\resources
   ..test\java
     ...\resources
</code></pre>

<p>Unit tests for a given layer easily find their place under \src\test... Everything that is domain specific has it's place in the entities module. Now something like a FileStorageStrategy should go into the repositories module, since we don't need to know exactly what the implementation is. In the services layer, we only know the repository interface, we do not care what the specific implementation is (separation of concerns).</p>

<p>There are multiple advantages to this approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>clear separation of concerns</li>
<li>each module is packageable as a jar (or a war in the case of the web module) and thus allows for easier code reuse (e.g., we could install the module in the maven repository and reuse it in another project)</li>
<li>maximum independence of each part of the project</li>
</ul>

<p>I know this doesn't answer all your questions, but I think this could put you on the right path and could prove useful to others.</p>

Here's what I'm doing for Windows.  BTW, I'm creating .app and .dmg for Mac, but haven't figured out what to do for Linux yet.</p>

<h2>Project Copies of launch4j and NSIS</h2>

<p>In my project I have a ""vendor"" directory and underneath it I have a directory for ""launch4j"" and ""nsis"".  Within each is a copy of the install for each application.  I find it easier to have a copy local to the project rather than forcing others to install both products and set up some kind of environment variable to point to each.</p>

<h2>Script Files</h2>

<p>I also have a ""scripts"" directory in my project that holds various configuration/script files for my project.  First there is the launch4j.xml file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;launch4jConfig&gt;
  &lt;dontWrapJar&gt;true&lt;/dontWrapJar&gt;
  &lt;headerType&gt;gui&lt;/headerType&gt;
  &lt;jar&gt;rpgam.jar&lt;/jar&gt;
  &lt;outfile&gt;rpgam.exe&lt;/outfile&gt;
  &lt;errTitle&gt;&lt;/errTitle&gt;
  &lt;cmdLine&gt;&lt;/cmdLine&gt;
  &lt;chdir&gt;.&lt;/chdir&gt;
  &lt;priority&gt;normal&lt;/priority&gt;
  &lt;downloadUrl&gt;http://www.rpgaudiomixer.com/&lt;/downloadUrl&gt;
  &lt;supportUrl&gt;&lt;/supportUrl&gt;
  &lt;customProcName&gt;false&lt;/customProcName&gt;
  &lt;stayAlive&gt;false&lt;/stayAlive&gt;
  &lt;manifest&gt;&lt;/manifest&gt;
  &lt;icon&gt;&lt;/icon&gt;
  &lt;jre&gt;
    &lt;path&gt;&lt;/path&gt;
    &lt;minVersion&gt;1.5.0&lt;/minVersion&gt;
    &lt;maxVersion&gt;&lt;/maxVersion&gt;
    &lt;jdkPreference&gt;preferJre&lt;/jdkPreference&gt;
  &lt;/jre&gt;
  &lt;splash&gt;
    &lt;file&gt;..\images\splash.bmp&lt;/file&gt;
    &lt;waitForWindow&gt;true&lt;/waitForWindow&gt;
    &lt;timeout&gt;60&lt;/timeout&gt;
    &lt;timeoutErr&gt;true&lt;/timeoutErr&gt;
  &lt;/splash&gt;
&lt;/launch4jConfig&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then there's the NSIS script rpgam-setup.nsis.  It can take a VERSION argument to help name the file.</p>

<h2>Ant Integration</h2>

<p>I have some targets in my Ant buildfile (build.xml) to handle the above.  First I tel Ant to import launch4j's Ant tasks:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;property name=""launch4j.dir"" location=""vendor/launch4j"" /&gt;
&lt;taskdef name=""launch4j"" 
    classname=""net.sf.launch4j.ant.Launch4jTask""
    classpath=""${launch4j.dir}/launch4j.jar:${launch4j.dir}/lib/xstream.jar"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I then have a simple target for creating the wrapper executable:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;target name=""executable-windows"" depends=""jar"" description=""Create Windows executable (EXE)""&gt;
    &lt;launch4j configFile=""scripts/launch4j.xml"" outfile=""${exeFile}"" /&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And another target for making the installer:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;target name=""installer-windows"" depends=""executable-windows"" description=""Create the installer for Windows (EXE)""&gt;
    &lt;!-- Lay out files needed for building the installer --&gt;
    &lt;mkdir dir=""${windowsLayoutDirectory}"" /&gt;
    &lt;copy file=""${jarFile}"" todir=""${windowsLayoutDirectory}"" /&gt;
    &lt;copy todir=""${windowsLayoutDirectory}/lib""&gt;
        &lt;fileset dir=""${libraryDirectory}"" /&gt;
        &lt;fileset dir=""${windowsLibraryDirectory}"" /&gt;
    &lt;/copy&gt;
    &lt;copy todir=""${windowsLayoutDirectory}/icons""&gt;
         &lt;fileset dir=""${iconsDirectory}"" /&gt;
    &lt;/copy&gt;
    &lt;copy todir=""${windowsLayoutDirectory}"" file=""${exeFile}"" /&gt;

    &lt;mkdir dir=""${windowsInstallerDirectory}"" /&gt;

    &lt;!-- Build the installer using NSIS --&gt;
    &lt;exec executable=""vendor/nsis/makensis.exe""&gt;
        &lt;arg value=""/DVERSION=${version}"" /&gt;
        &lt;arg value=""scripts/rpgam-setup.nsi"" /&gt;
    &lt;/exec&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The top portion of that just copies the necessary files for the installer to a temporary location and the second half executes the script that uses all of it to make the installer.</p>

Here's an example for a web app I worked on:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>MyProject / src / main / resources / spring /</code>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>datasource.xml</strong></em>  -  My single data source bean.</li>
<li><em><strong>persistence.xml</strong></em>  -  My DAOs/Repositories. Depends on <code>datasource.xml</code> beans.</li>
<li><em><strong>services.xml</strong></em>  -  Service layer implementations. These are usually the beans to which I apply transactionality using AOP. Depends on <code>persistence.xml</code> beans.</li>
<li><em><strong>controllers.xml</strong></em>  - My Spring MVC controllers. Depends on <code>services.xml</code> beans.</li>
<li><em><strong>views.xml</strong></em> - My view implementations.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This list is neither perfect nor exhaustive, but I hope it illustrates the point. Choose whatever naming strategy and granularity works best for you.</p>

<p>In my (limited) experience, I've seen this approach yeild the following benefits:</p>

<p><strong>Clearer architecture</strong></p>

<p>Clearly named context files gives those unfamiliar with your project structure a reasonable 
place to start looking for bean definitions. Can make detecting circular/unwanted dependencies a little easier.</p>

<p><strong>Helps domain design</strong></p>

<p>If you want to add a bean definition, but it doesn't fit well in any of your context files, perhaps there's a new concept or concern emerging? Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Suppose you want to make your Service layer transactional with AOP. Do you add those bean definitions to <code>services.xml</code>, or put them in their own <code>transactionPolicy.xml</code>? Talk it over with your team. Should your transaction policy be pluggable?</li>
<li>Add Acegi/Spring Security beans to your <code>controllers.xml</code> file, or create a <code>security.xml</code> context file? Do you have different security requirements for different deployments/environments?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Integration testing</strong></p>

<p>You can wire up a subset of your application for integration testing (ex: given the above files, to test the database you need to create only <code>datasource.xml</code> and <code>persistence.xml</code> beans).</p>

<p>Specifically, you can annotate an integration test class as such:</p>

<pre><code>@ContextConfiguration(locations = { ""/spring/datasource.xml"" , ""/spring/persistence.xml"" })
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Works well with Spring IDE's Beans Graph</strong></p>

<p>Having lots of focused and well-named context files makes it easy to create custom BeansConfigSets to visualize the layers of your app using Spring IDE's <a href=""http://springide.org/project/wiki/BeansGraph"">Beans Graph</a>. I've used this before to give new team members a high-level overview of our application's organization.</p>

<p>Spring MVC and JDBC template would be my starting recommendations.  You can go a very long way just with those.</p>

<p>My recommendation would be to follow the Spring architectural recommendations faithfully.  Use their layering ideas.  Make sure that your web layer is completely detachable from the rest.  You do this by letting the web tier interact with the back end only through the service layer.</p>

<p>If you want to reuse that service layer, a good recommendation is to expose it using Spring ""contract first"" web services.  If you start with the XML messages that you pass back and forth, your client and server can be completely decoupled.</p>

<p>Its <strong>includeMethod()</strong> can exclude any method we want, like a public not-annotated method.</p>

<p>However, to register a custom <em>Java</em> MethodSelector, you must add it to the <strong>XMLTest</strong> instance managed by any TestRunner, which means you need your own <strong>custom TestRunner</strong>.</p>

<p>But, to build a custom TestRunner, you need to register a <strong>TestRunnerFactory</strong>, through the <strong>-testrunfactory</strong> option.</p>

<p>BUT that -testrunfactory is NEVER taken into account by <strong>TestNG</strong> class... so you need also to define a custom TestNG class :</p>

<ul>
<li>in order to override the configure(Map) method, </li>
<li>so you can actually set the TestRunnerFactory</li>
<li>TestRunnerFactory which will build you a custom TestRunner,</li>
<li>TestRunner which will set to the XMLTest instance a custom XMLMethodSelector</li>
<li>XMLMethodSelector which will build a custom IMethodSelector</li>
<li>IMethodSelector which will exclude any TestNG methods of your choosing!</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok... it's a nightmare. But it is also a code-challenge, so it must be a little challenging ;)</p>

<p>All the code is available at <a href=""http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/6446"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>DZone snippets</strong></a>.</p>

<p>As usual for a code challenge:</p>

<ul>
<li>one java class (and quite a few inner classes)</li>
<li>copy-paste the class in a 'source/test' directory (since the package is 'test')</li>
<li>run it (no arguments needed)</li>

<p><strong>Update from Mike Stone:</strong></p>

<p>I'm going to accept this because it sounds pretty close to what I ended up doing, but I figured I would add what I did as well.</p>

<p>Basically, I created a Groups annotation that behaves like the groups property of the Test (and other) annotations.</p>

<p>Then, I created a GroupsAnnotationTransformer, which uses IAnnotationTransformer to look at all tests and test classes being defined, then modifies the test to add the groups, which works perfectly with group exclusion and inclusion.</p>

<p>Modify the build to use the new annotation transformer, and it all works perfectly!</p>

<p>Well... the one caveat is that it doesn't add the groups to non-test methods... because at the time I did this, there was another annotation transformer that lets you transform ANYTHING, but it somehow wasn't included in the TestNG I was using for some reason... so it is a good idea to make your before/after annotated methods to alwaysRun=true... which is sufficient for me.</p>

<p>The end result is I can do:</p>

<pre><code>@Groups({ ""myGroup1"", ""myGroup2""})
public class MyTestCase {
    @Test
    @Groups(""aMethodLevelGroup"")
    public void myTest() {
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I made the transformer work with subclassing and everything.</p>

None of the file operations use anything other than the system default character encoding. As every good developer knows, <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html"" rel=""nofollow"">there's no such thing as plain text</a>.</p>

<p>Here is how to get the platform encoding to see what you're using:</p>

<pre><code>public static String getDefaultFileEncoding() {
    final String keyEncoding = ""file.encoding"";
    final String encoding = System
            .getProperty(keyEncoding);
    if (encoding == null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException(
                keyEncoding
                        + ""=null"");
    }
    return encoding;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, use the <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/nio/charset/Charset.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Charset</a> class for a strongly typed value (alas, not every API in Java 6 has been updated to support Charset, so sometimes you need to fall back on a String). <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/intl/encoding.doc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">List of supported encodings.</a></p>

<p>The <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/Reader.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Reader</a>/<a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/Writer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Writer</a> implementations handle the character conversion. For example:</p>

<pre><code>//&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
InputStream in = new FileInputStream(""myfile.xml"");
/*Reader reader = new InputStreamReader(in); ///WRONG!!!!!!*/
Reader reader = new InputStreamReader(in, ""UTF-8""); //RIGHT
</code></pre>

<p>File streams are being handled in a way that may lead to resource leaks. Streams should be closed in a finally block. This ensures that they are closed even if there is an I/O error. Note that the stream initialization is before the try block.</p>

<pre><code>OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(""file.txt"");
try {
    //write to stream
} finally {
    out.close();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is an example of how to read a file into a String:</p>

<pre><code>  /** Copies characters from reader to writer */
  public static void copy(Reader reader, Writer writer)
      throws IOException {
    final int bufferSize = 1024; // arbitrary value
    char[] buffer = new char[bufferSize];
    while (true) {
      int r = reader.read(buffer);
      if (r &lt; 0) {
        break;
      }
      writer.write(buffer, 0, r);
    }
  }

  /** Copies contents of File to String. Decodes from given encoding. */
  public static String readToString(File file,
      Charset encoding) throws IOException {
    Writer writer = new StringWriter();
    InputStream in = new FileInputStream(file);
    Closeable resource = in;
    try {
      Reader reader = new InputStreamReader(in, encoding);
      resource = reader;
      copy(reader, writer);
    } finally {
      resource.close();
    }
    return writer.toString();
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Sample usage:</p>

<pre><code>  public static void main(String[] args) {
    File file = new File(""foo.xml"");
    Charset utf8 = Charset.forName(""UTF8"");
    try {
      String s = readToString(file, utf8);
      System.out.println(s);
    } catch (IOException e) {

          .println(""Error:"" + e.getLocalizedMessage());

<p>A WSDL document defines services as collections of network endpoints, or ports. In WSDL, the abstract definition of endpoints and messages is separated from their concrete network deployment or data format bindings. This allows the reuse of abstract definitions: messages, which are abstract descriptions of the data being exchanged, and port types which are abstract collections of operations. The concrete protocol and data format specifications for a particular port type constitutes a reusable binding. A port is defined by associating a network address with a reusable binding, and a collection of ports define a service. Hence, a WSDL document uses the following elements in the definition of network services:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Types</strong>– a container for data type definitions using some type system (such as XSD).</li>
<li><strong>Message</strong>– an abstract, typed definition of the data being communicated.</li>
<li><strong>Operation</strong>– an abstract description of an action supported by the service.</li>
<li><strong>Port Type</strong>–an abstract set of operations supported by one or more endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Binding</strong>– a concrete protocol and data format specification for a particular port type.</li>
<li><strong>Port</strong>– a single endpoint defined as a combination of a binding and a network address.</li>
<li><strong>Service</strong>– a collection of related endpoints.</li>

<pre><code>netstat -rn

<p>Your gateway's IP address will appear in the second field of the line that starts either <code>default</code> or <code>0.0.0.0</code>.</p>

<p>This gets around a number of problems with trying to use <code>traceroute</code>:</p>

<ol>
<li>on Windows <code>traceroute</code> is actually <code>tracert.exe</code>, so there's no need for O/S dependencies in the code</li>
<li>it's a quick command to run - it gets information from the O/S, not from the network</li>
<li><code>traceroute</code> is sometimes blocked by the network</li>
</ol>

<p>The only downside is that it will be necessary to keep reading lines from the <code>netstat</code> output until the right line is found, since there'll be more than one line of output.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The Default Gateway's IP Address is in the second field of the line that starts with 'default' if you are on a MAC (tested on Lion), or in the <strong>third field</strong> of the line that starts with '0.0.0.0' (tested on Windows 7)</p>

The suggestions you gave seem more for user prefs than application config, and aren't usually something that the user would ever deal with directly (the app should provide the configuration options in the UI, and then update the files).

<li>I like YAML in /etc. Is that reimplemented in windows?</li>

<li>User:
<ul>
<li>Do you permit users to edit config with text editor?</li>

<ul>
<li>File(s) in project directory? (Version control usually follows this model...)</li>

<li>Are there only a few flat values? Consider YAML.</li>
<li>Is the data nested, or dependent in some way? (This is where it gets interesting.)</li>

<p>But application config isn't always just key/value pairs.  Look at something like the tomcat configuration for what ports it listens on.  Here's an example:</p>

<p>If your app's config is simple, then something simple like an INI file that's read into a dictionary is probably fine.

Just consider each piece of your array an object, or, at the very least, the first level of the array as an object and each sub level as variables inside the object. The build a data structure that you populate with said objects and access the objects through the data structure's given accessors.</p>

<p>Something like:</p>

<pre><code>class Schedule
{
  private String group;
  private String season;
  private String rundays;
  public Schedule() { this.group = null; this.season = null; this.rundays= null; }
  public void setGroup(String g) { this.group = g; }
  public String getGroup() { return this.group; }

public ArrayList&lt;Schedule&gt; schedules = new ArrayList&lt;Schedule&gt;();
Schedule s = new Schedule();
s.setGroup(...);
...
schedules.add(s);
...

<p>Of course that probably isn't right either. I'd make each season an object, and maybe each weekday list as an object too. Anyway, its more easily reused, understood, and extensible than a hobbled-together Hashtable that tries to imitate your PHP code. Of course, PHP has objects too, and you should use them in a similar fashion instead of your uber-arrays, wherever possible. I do understand the temptation to cheat, though. PHP makes it so easy, and so fun!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A.Summer=M<br />
  A.Spring=tTS<br />
  B.Summer=T</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Usually I don't like to move static data like this to an external file because it increases the ""distance"" between the data and the code that uses it.  However, whenever you're dealing with nested Collections, especially maps, things can get real ugly, real fast.</p>

<p>If you don't like this idea, maybe you can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class WaterScheduler

Wing is quite right that these should probably be <strong><em>constants</em></strong> (or maybe enums).</p>

<p>What Bruce needs, at it's heart, is simply a lookup table.  He doesn't need a hierarchy of objects and interfaces; he needs a way to look up a schedule based on a season and a group identifier.  Turning things into objects only makes sense if they have responsibilities or state.  If they have neither, then they are simply identifiers, and building special objects for them just makes the codebase larger.</p>

<p>You <em>could</em> build, e.g., <code>Group</code> objects that each contain a set of schedule strings (one for each season), but if all the <code>Group</code> object does is provide lookup functionality, then you've reinvented the lookup table in a much less intuitive fashion.  If he has to look up the group, and then lookup the schedule, all he has is a two-step lookup table that took longer to code, is more likely to be buggy, and will be harder to maintain.</p>

<p>Embedding a DB in Java doesn't make it easier to maintain.  There's now an additional code dependency that did not previously exist.  Updating the set of schedules is now more difficult, as either a custom tool must be coded or a DB-specific interface must be used, whereas previous notepad.exe was sufficient.  Scalability is not a concern here, either.  The needs of this system could increase by a million and the flat file would still work just fine.</p>

<p>Certainly, it's possible that in the future needs will evolve to the point that it's worth moving to a database.  That's when you make the change.  Trying to future-proof an application never works, because we <em>always</em> assume incorrectly about future needs.  We can't say it'll only take a few hours to embed the database either, because we suck at estimating schedules, too.  If there even comes a time when the database is appropriate, <em>then</em> refactor the code to use a database.

<blockquote>
  <p>Some of the features in this taglib

<p>You could probably do this with the <strong><a href=""http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt</a></strong> taglib.</p>

<pre class=""lang-jsp prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;fmt:bundle basename=""messages""&gt;

<p>The downside is that this isn't valid XML and yanking the values to variables involves more indirection, lookups and verbosity. This is not a good solution.</p>

<p>I don't know Struts, but if it is anything like JavaServer Faces (same architect), then there is probably support for configuring a replacement control. I would either replace the existing control with a more flexible one or add a new one.</p>

<p>There is no way you should be doing this and I see this as a fault in your translation process (I am an ex-localization engineer and ex-developer of localization tools). The <code>{0}</code> characters should be included in the files that are sent to the translators. The localization guidelines should explain the string's context and the meaning of any variables.</p>

<p>You can programmatically validate the property bundles on return. String-specific regex's might do the trick. It isn't outside the realms of possibility that ""address"" and ""contact information"" would swap order during translation.</p>

<p>The simplest solution is to redesign the messages to render:</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;a href=""/address.do""&gt;Please update your address.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=""/contact.do""&gt;Please update your contact information.&lt;/a&gt;

<p>Generally, it will lead to fewer problems. Sometimes you have to compromise your UI design to accommodate localization; sometimes you need to compromise your localization process to accommodate the UI.</p>

<p>Any time a developer manually manipulates post-translation strings is a source of potentially expensive bugs. Cutting/pasting or string editing can result in character corruption, misplaced strings, etc. A translation defect needs the participation of outside parties to fix which involves cost and takes time.</p>

<p>Thinking on it, something like this might be less ugly:</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;p&gt;Please update your address and contact information.

      spreadsheet/
      …
   tags/
      calc/

      calendar/
      spreadsheet/</p>

<p>""There's nothing particularly incorrect about such a layout, but it may or may not seem as intuitive for your users. Especially in large, multi-project situations with many users, those users may tend to be familiar with only one or two of the projects in the repository. But the projects-as-branch-siblings tends to de-emphasize project individuality and focus on the entire set of projects as a single entity. That's a social issue though. We like our originally suggested arrangement for purely practical reasons—it's easier to ask about (or modify, or migrate elsewhere) the entire history of a single project when there's a single repository path that holds the entire history—past, present, tagged, and branched—for that project and that project alone.""</p>

<p>For my own, I tend to agree quite strongly with this and prefer the following layout:
/
   utils/
      calc/
         trunk/
         tags/
         branches/
      calendar/
         trunk/
         tags/
         branches/

   office/
      spreadsheet/
         trunk/
         tags/
         branches/</p>

<p>The reason are simply that its impractical to tag a complete project set when one would want to tag only a specific subset.</p>

<p>Let's use an example: If project-1 depends on moduleA v1.1 and moduleB v2.3, I don't want newer moduleA v2.x to appear in the tags. In fact, when coming back some days/weeks/months later to this tagged release, I would be forced to open the bundle descriptor in the tagged version of project-1 to read the version of moduleA actually required.</p>

<p>Moreover, if I have to make a specific backup of this release's sources onto a CD, I just want to export this tag without downloading hundreds of megabytes of unrelated stuff.</p>

   static &lt;T extends Enum&lt;T&gt; &amp; Bar&gt; void fooBar(T the enum) {}

<p>This is useful when you have a number of different enums that implement some sort of pattern. For instance, a number of pairs of enums that have a parent-child relationship.</p>

enum TransportMedium {Land, Sea, Air;}

<p>You can write generic methods that say ""Ok, given an enum value thats a parent of some other enum values, what percentage of all the possible child enums of the child type have this particular parent value as their parent?"", and have it all typesafe and done without casting. (eg: that ""Sea"" is 33% of all possible vehicles, and ""Green"" 20% of all possible Pastels).</p>

<p>The code look like this. It's pretty nasty, but there are ways to make it better. Note in particuar that the ""leaf"" classes themselves are quite neat - the generic classes have declarations that are horribly ugly, but you only write them onece. Once the generic classes are there, then using them is easy.</p>

<p>It requires more bytecodes to reference a class-scope variable than a method-scope variable. The addition of a method call prior to the critical loop adds little overhead (and the call might be inlined by the compiler anyway).</p>

<p>Another advantage to this technique (always using accessors) is that it eliminates a potential bug in the <strong>Slow</strong> class. If a second thread were to continually reset the value of <strong>i</strong> to 0 (by calling <code>slow.setI( 0 )</code>, for example), the <strong>Slow</strong> class could never end its loop. Calling the accessor and using a local variable eliminates that possibility.</p>

<p>Another, arguably better and less ugly approach though is to use AtomicReference (or AtomicBoolean/AtomicInteger/…) class from java.util.concurrent.atomic package.</p>

<p>One of the benefits in doing so is that these classes also provide such methods as <code>compareAndSet</code>, which may be useful if you're creating several threads which can modify the same variable.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another useful related pattern:</p>

<pre><code>final AtomicBoolean dataMsgReceived = new AtomicBoolean(false);
final AtomicReference&lt;Message&gt; message = new AtomicReference&lt;Message&gt;();
withMessageHandler(new MessageHandler() {
    public void handleMessage(Message msg) {
         if (msg.isData()) {
             synchronized (dataMsgReceived) {
                 message.set(msg);
                 dataMsgReceived.set(true);
                 dataMsgReceived.notifyAll();
             }
         }
    }
}, new Interruptible() {
    public void run() throws InterruptedException {
        synchronized (dataMsgReceived) {
            while (!dataMsgReceived.get()) {
                dataMsgReceived.wait();
            }
        }
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>In this particular example we could have simply waited on message for it to become non-null, however null may often be a valid value and then you need to use a separate flag to finish the wait.</p>

<p><code>waitMessageHandler(…)</code> above is yet another useful pattern: it sets up a handler somewhere, then starts executing the <em>Interruptible</em> which may throw an exception, and then removes the handler in the finally block, like so:</p>

<pre><code>private final AtomicReference&lt;MessageHandler&gt; messageHandler = new AtomicReference&lt;MessageHandler&gt;();
public void withMessageHandler(MessageHandler handler, Interruptible logic) throws InterruptedException {
    synchronized (messageHandler) {
        try {
            messageHandler.set(handler);
            logic.run();
        } finally {
            messageHandler.set(null);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here I assume that the <strong>messageHandler</strong>'s (if it's not null) <code>handleMessage(…)</code> method is called by another thread when a message is received. <strong>messageHandler</strong> must not be simply of <em>MessageHandler</em> type: that way you will synchronize on a changing variable, which is clearly a bug.</p>

<p>Of course, it doesn't need to be <em>InterruptedException</em>, it could be something like <em>IOException</em>, or whatever makes sense in a particular piece of code.</p>

<p>Guess what this prints:</p>

<pre><code>Long value = new Long(0);
System.out.println(value.equals(0));

<hr>

<p>And, guess what this returns: </p>

<pre><code>public int returnSomething() {

        throw new RuntimeException(""foo!"");
    } finally {
        return 0;
    }

<p>the above should not surprise good developers.</p>

<hr>

<p>In Java you can declare an array in following valid ways:</p>

<pre><code>String[] strings = new String[] { ""foo"", ""bar"" };
// the above is equivalent to the following:
String[] strings = { ""foo"", ""bar"" };
</code></pre>

<p>So following Java code is perfectly valid:</p>

<pre><code>public class Foo {
    public void doSomething(String[] arg) {}

    public void example() {
        String[] strings = { ""foo"", ""bar"" };
        doSomething(strings);

    public void doSomething(String[] arg) {}

    public void example() {
        doSomething({ ""foo"", ""bar"" });

<p>I have five main gripes with Java:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Java does not have real generics  </p>

<p>Generics in Java are simply syntax sugar. When you compile, the generic information is stripped out, and the compiler automaticly boxes/unboxes the values. This means you don't get the speed advantage of avoiding casts with strong typed generics (ala C#), and you also cannot use reflection to introspect the generic type, because it is gone.</p></li>
<li><p>Java's namespaces (err Packages) are polluted. </p>

<p>This is mostly personal preferenced, but I find the java.lang.* namespaces to be both poorly organized, and stuffed to the gills in deprecated classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Java does not have anonymous methods, or a function pointer equivalent (ie, delegates).</p>

<p>While Java does have anonymous inner classes, I find anonymous methods more useful (and much more lightweight) in my day to day use. This is also why wiring up a GUI in Java is so painful.</p></li>
<li><p>WTF is wrong with Java's Date/Time Handling? </p>

<p>I don't need to go to into detail on this one. Sun screwed up big time here, a minor list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Java DateTime Objects are mutable (wtf? you can't pass a date to a method and trust it not to be modified, or depend on a Java Date as a hashkey.)</li>
<li>Java has no concept of ""TimeSpan""</li>
<li>Java DateTime is an object, not a struct, so it must be allocated on the heap.</li>
<li>Java's lack of operator overloading means you cannot compare two DateTimes with comparison operators (&lt;=, =>, ==, != etc).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Getters and Setters as methods. This is a personal preference, but I much prefer this:</p>

<p>DateTime currentTime = DateTime.Now;</p></li>

<p>Compared too:</p>

<pre><code> DateTime currentTime = new DateTime().getCurrentTime();

<li><p>Doing the simple easy thing is cluttered up with implementation details of what you'd need when you're doing the complex, carefully optimized thing</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To elaborate:</p>

<p>The Kingdom of Nouns syndrome is another way of saying that Java doesn't want you to create functions as objects.  It's possible, but it goes violently against the design principles of just about every library and framework you'll see.  Time and time again I find myself settling on code duplication or inelegant hacks because Java doesn't like functions as objects.  If Java gets <a href=""http://www.javac.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">closures</a> I will be a happy person indeed.</p>

<p>As for the second, I'll simply pose a question: Can you write a Java program to read in a file line by line and do something with each line?   Off the top of your head?  Without referring to documentation or other code?  Without your IDE?  And have it compile and run on your first try?  If you can, you're a far better BufferedInputPerson than I am.</p>

<p>This isn't so much a problem with the language as it is the standard library.  Well, ignoring the exception debate.  You did remember to handle exceptions, didn't you?  </p>

<p>I mean, in theory, it could be as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>for(String line : new FileLineReader(filename))
    doSomething(line);
</code></pre>

<p>...but that isn't really in the Java style.  I mean, I love the power of the Java library, but it  seems like not much effort is made to make the easy things easy.</p>

<p>That said, Java does have many real drawbacks and annoyances (as does any language). Most of them have been outlined above. I particularly second Patrick's comment on checked exceptions. Here is my favorite example of that:</p>

<pre><code>try {
    ...
    writer = new FileWriter(pathToFile);
    writer.write(""Some stuff"");
    writer.flush();
} catch(IOException e) {
    // OK, so an IO error could occur, log it and deal with if possible
} finally {
    // We want to close the stream regardless of if an exception occurred.
    try {
         writer.close(); // But close() throws a checked exception!
    } catch (IOException e) {
         // It does not make any sense to throw this exception, so we have to catch it
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The only way to make this code less bloated is to have the method throw an IOException, which is essentially only passing the problem on to the caller.</p>

<p>Not sure how thats relevant but thats my experience. But I am surprised visual studio is still today written in C++ - I would think that it would be in Microsoft's interest to use C# - if nothing else it would really push its performance hard, nothing like eating your own dog food !</p>

<p>UPDATE:
Looking at the first slew of answers, I couldn't disagree more.  Particularly in the Java space, you should find plenty of mentors/resources on working out your application with Objects, <strong>not a database-centric approach</strong>.  Database design is typically the first step for Microsoft folks (which I do daily, but am in a recovery program, er, Alt.Net).  If you keep the focus on what you need to deliver to a customer and let your ORM figure out how to persist your objects, your design should be better.</p>

<p>And then there's the infrastructure design: the team should settle on conventions on how to structure the program first and foremost. And then we work together to agree first on a design for the common functionality of the system (e.g., things everyone needs like persistence, logging, etc.). This becomes the framework of the system.</p>

Straight out of university, I was asked to design the database and business logic layer, while other people would take care of the UI. Meanwhile the boss was looking over my shoulder, unwilling to let go of what used to be his baby and was now mine, and poking his finger in it. Three years later, developers were fleeing the company and we were still X months away from actually selling anything.</p>

<p>The big mistake was in being too ambitious. If this is your first job, you <em>will</em> make mistakes and you <em>will</em> need to change how things work long after you've written them. We had all sorts of features that made the system more complicated than it needed to be, both on the database level and in the API that it presented to other developers. In the end, the whole thing was just far too complicated to support all at once and just died.</p>

<p>So my advice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you're not sure about taking on such a big job single-handed, don't. Tell your employers, and get them to find or hire somebody for you to work with who can help you out. If people need to be added to the project, then it should be done near the start rather than after stuff starts going wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Think very carefully about what the product is for, and to boil it down to the <strong>simplest</strong> set of requirements you can think of. If the people giving you the spec aren't technical, try to see past what they've written to what will actually work and make money. Talk to customers and salespeople, and understand the market.</p></li>
<li><p>There's no shame in admitting you're wrong. If it turns out that the entire system needs to be rewritten, because you made some mistake in your first version, then it's better to admit this as soon as possible so you can get to it. Correspondingly, don't try to make an architecture that can anticipate every possible contingency in your first version, because you don't know what every contingency is and will just get it wrong. Write once with an eye to throwing away and starting again - you may not have to, the first version may be fine, but admit it if you do.</p></li>

<p>Draw it up on plain paper, thinking of where to section off the code. Remeber not to mix logic with GUI code (common error). This way you will be set to extend your applications reach in the future to servlets and/or applets or whatever platform comes along.

<p>I believe the question was how to remove the labels, not how to optimize the algorithm. It appeared to me that the original poster was unaware of how to use 'continue' and 'break' keywords without labels, but of course, my assumptions may be wrong. </p>

<p>When it comes to performance, the post does not give any information about the implementation of the other functions, so for all I know they might as well be downloading the results via FTP as consisting of simple calculations inlined by the compiler.</p>

<p>That being said, doing the same test twice is not optimal&mdash;in theory.</p>

<p>EDIT: On a second thought, the example is actually not a horrible use of labels. I agree that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto#Criticism_of_goto_usage"" rel=""nofollow"">""goto is a no-no""</a>, but not because of code like this. The use of labels here does not actually affect the readability of the code in a significant way. Of course, they are not required and can easily be omitted, but not using them simply because ""using labels is bad"" is not a good argument in this case. After all, removing the labels does not make the code much easier to read, as others have already commented.</p>

However, I think in general leveraging OSGi in your application isn't one of those ""let's use this framework, because it's hype"" decision. It's more of a design question, but then everything that OSGi gives you in terms of design, you can have with vanilla Java as well.</p>

<p>As for the runtime, you cannot just add an existing application and make it OSGi enabled. It needs to be design to be dynamic. Spring DM makes it easy to hide that from you, but it's still there and you need to be aware of it.</p>

In its simplest form you make a single OSGi bundle out of your entire application. Clearly this is not a best practice but it can be useful to get a feel for deploying a bundle in an OSGi container (Equinox, Felix, Knoplerfish, etc).</p>

<p>To take it to the next level you'll want to start splitting your app into components, components should typically have a set of responsibilities that can be isolated from the rest of your application through a set of interfaces and class dependencies. Identifying these purely by hand can range from rather straightforward for a well designed highly cohesive but loosely coupled application to a nightmare for interlocked source code that you are not familiar with.</p>

<p>Some help can come from tools like <a href=""http://clarkware.com/software/JDepend.html"">JDepend</a> which can show you the coupling of Java packages against other packages/classes in your system. A package with low efferent coupling should be easier to extract into an OSGi bundle than one with high efferent coupling. Even more architectural insight can be had with pro tools like <a href=""http://www.headwaysoftware.com/products/structure101/index.php"">Structure 101</a>.</p>

<p>Purely on a technical level, working daily with an application that consists of 160 OSGi bundles and using Spring DM I can confirm that the transition from ""normal"" Spring to Spring DM is largely pain free. The extra namespace and the fact that you can (and should) isolate your OSGi specific Spring configuration in separate files makes it even easier to have both with and without OSGi deployment scenarios.</p>

<p>OSGi is a deep and wide component model, documentation I recommend:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.osgi.org/Release4/Download"">OSGi R4 Specification</a>: Get the PDFs of the Core and Compendium specification, they are canonical, authoritative and very readable. Have a shortcut to them handy at all times, you will consult them.</li>
<li>Read up on OSGi best practices, there is a large set of things you <strong>can</strong> do but a somewhat smaller set of things you <strong>should</strong> do and there are some things you should <strong>never do</strong> (DynamicImport: * for example). </li>

So wsdl2java does not know that WS-Security is even required for this service. The fact that security constraints are not present in a WSE WSDL is a big disappointment to me (WCF will include WS-Trust information in a WSDL).</p>

<p>On the client end, you'll need to use <a href=""http://ws.apache.org/rampart/"">Rampart</a> to add the necessary WS-Security headers to your outgoing client message. Since the WSDL does not report what WS-Security settings are necessary, you're best off by asking the service provider what is required. WS-Security requirements may be simple plaintext password, or might be X509 certificates, or might be encrypted message..... Rampart should be able to handle most of these scenarios.</p>

<p>Apache Rampart is ""turned on"" by engaging the module in your axis2.xml file. You'll need to download the Rampart module and put it in a specific place in your axis2 directory, then modify the xml file. You can also engage Rampart programatically (please edit your original question if this is a requirement and I'll edit this response).</p>

<p>Depending on how you configure rampart (through other XML files or programatically), it will intercept any outgoing messages and add the necessary WS-Security information to it. I've personally used axis2 with rampart to call a WSE3 service that is secured with UsernameToken in plaintext and it worked great. Similar, but more advanced scenarios should also work.  There are more details on how to set up and get started with Rampart on the site linked above. If you have problems about the specifics of Rampart or how to use Rampart with your particular WSE setup, then edit your question and I'll try my best to answer.</p>

<p>It seems that services built in .NET are following an older ws-addressing standard (<a href=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/03/addressing/"">http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/03/addressing/</a>) and axis2 only understands the newer standard (<a href=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/08/addressing/"">http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/08/addressing/</a>).</p>

<p>In addition, the policyCache.config file provided is in a form that the axis2 rampart module can't understand.</p>

<p>So the steps we had to do, in a nutshell:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read the policyCache.config and try to understand it.  Then rewrite it into a policy that rampart could understand.  (Some <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/466238/Official-Documentation-ws-apache-org-Axis2-Part-2"">updated docs</a> helped.)</li>
<li>Configure rampart with this policy.</li>
<li>Take the keys that were provided in the .pfx file and convert them to a java key store.  There is a utility that comes with Jetty that can do that.</li>
<li>Configure rampart with that key store.</li>
<li>Write a custom axis2 handler that backward-converts the newer ws-addressing stuff that comes out of axis2 into the older stuff expected by the service.</li>
<li>Configure axis2 to use the handler on outgoing messages.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end it was a lot of configuration and code for something that is supposed to be an open standard supported by the vendors.</p>

<p>Although I'm not sure what the alternative is...can you wait for the vendors (or in this case, the one vendor) to make sure that everything will inter-op?</p>

<p>As a postscript I'll add that I didn't end up doing the work, it was someone else on my team, but I think I got the salient details correct.  The other option that I was considering (before my teammate took over) was to call the WSS4J API directly to construct the SOAP envelope as the .NET service expected it.  I think that would have worked too.</p>

<p>You'll need to change the following in your settings to get it to work:</p>

<ul>
<li>user -- replace with your sourceforce username</li>
<li>secret -- replace with your password</li>
<li>ormlite -- replace with your project name</li>
<li>/o/or/ -- replace with the first char and first 2 chars of your project name</li>
</ul>

<p>In my $HOME/.m2/settings.xml file I have the following for the SF server:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;server&gt;
  &lt;id&gt;sourceforge&lt;/id&gt;
  &lt;password&gt;secret&lt;/password&gt;
  &lt;filePermissions&gt;775&lt;/filePermissions&gt;
  &lt;directoryPermissions&gt;775&lt;/directoryPermissions&gt;
&lt;/server&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I don't specify the username in the settings.xml file because it needs to be username,project and I want to deploy multiple packages to SF.  Then, in my pom.xml file for the ormlite package I have the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;distributionManagement&gt;
 &lt;repository&gt;
  &lt;id&gt;sourceforge&lt;/id&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;SourceForge&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;url&gt;sftp://user,ormlite@frs.sourceforge.net:/home/frs/project/o/or/ormlite/releases
  &lt;/url&gt;

 &lt;snapshotRepository&gt;

 &lt;/snapshotRepository&gt;

First up I had the mvn site:deploy working following the instructions at <a href=""http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-site-plugin/examples/site-deploy-to-sourceforge.net.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this sourceforge site</a>. Basically you start the sourceforge shell with </p>

<pre><code>ssh -t user,project@shell.sourceforge.net create
</code></pre>

<p>That will create the shell at their end with a folder mounted to your project on a path such as (depending on your projects name):</p>

<pre><code>/home/groups/c/ch/chex4j/
</code></pre>

<p>In that shell I on the sourceforge server I created a folder for my repo under the project apache folder ""htdocs"" with </p>

<pre><code>mkdir /home/groups/c/ch/chex4j/htdocs/maven2
</code></pre>

<p>In my settings.xml I set the username and password to that shell server so that maven can login: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;settings xmlns=""http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0""
  xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""
  xsi:schemaLocation=""http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0

        &lt;/server&gt;
    &lt;/servers&gt;
&lt;/settings&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the pom.xml you just need your distibutionManagement section setup to name the server by ID that you set the password for in your settings file: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;distributionManagement&gt;
    &lt;site&gt;
        &lt;id&gt;chex4j.sf.net&lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;url&gt;scp://shell.sourceforge.net/home/groups/c/ch/chex4j/htdocs/
        &lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;/site&gt;
    &lt;repository&gt;
        &lt;id&gt;chex4j.sf.net&lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;SourceForge shell repo&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;url&gt;scp://shell.sourceforge.net/home/groups/c/ch/chex4j/htdocs/maven2&lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;/repository&gt;
&lt;/distributionManagement&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There the repository entry is the one for the mvn deploy command and the site entry is for the mvn site:deploy command. Then all I have to do is start the shell connection to bring up the server side then on my local side just run: </p>

<pre><code>mvn deploy
</code></pre>

<p>which uploads the jar, pom and sources and the like onto my sourceforge projects website. If you try to hit the /maven2 folder on your project website sourceforge kindly tell you that directory listing is off by default and how to fix it. To do this on the server shell you create a .htaccess file in your htdocs/maven2 folder containing the following apache options </p>

<pre><code>Options +Indexes
</code></pre>

<p>Then bingo, you have a maven repo which looks like: </p>

<p><a href=""http://chex4j.sourceforge.net/maven2/net/sf/chex4j/chex4j-core/1.0.0/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chex4j.sourceforge.net/maven2/net/sf/chex4j/chex4j-core/1.0.0/</a></p>

<p>Your sf.net shell it shuts down after a number of hours to not hog resources; so you run the ""ssh -t ... create"" when you want to deploy the site or your build artifacts. </p>

<p>You can browse all my maven project code under sourceforge to see my working settings: </p>

HTTP and XML have been around for a while, so I think they're here to stay.</p>

<p>Another reason I like it is that your server could be used by other clients, too, as long as they know HTTP and XML.</p>

This didn't solve the problem nonetheless.</p>

<p>I decided to start removing classes from the source tree to see if a could pinpoint the problem. Turns out we had a Web Service client class for <a href=""http://ws.apache.org/axis/"" rel=""nofollow"">Axis 1.4</a> that was auto-generated from a WSDL file. Now, this class is a monster (as in Frankenstein), it has 167 field members (all of them of type String), 167 getter/setter pairs (1 for each field), a constructor that receives all 167 fields as parameters, an equals method that compares all 167 fields in a strange way. For each field the comparison goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>(this.A == null &amp;&amp; other.getA() == null) || (this.A != null &amp;&amp; this.A.equals(other.getA()))
</code></pre>

<p>The result of this comparison is ""anded"" (&amp;&amp;) with the result of the comparison of the next field, and so on. The class goes on with a hashCode method that also uses all fields, some custom XML serialization methods and a method that returns a Axis-specific metadata object that describes the class and that also uses all field members.</p>

<p>This class is never modified, so I just put a compiled version in the application classpath and the project compiled without issues. </p>

<p>Now, I know that removing this single source file solved the problem. However, I have absolutely no idea as to why this particular class caused the problem. It will be nice to know; what can cause or causes a StackOverflowError during compilation of Java code? I think I'll post that question.</p>

<p>It is probable that evaluating the long expression in your java file consumes lots of memory and because this is being done in conjunction with the compilation of other classes, the VM just runs out of stack space. Your generated class is perhaps pushing the legal limits for its contents. See chapter <a href=""http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jvms/second_edition/html/ClassFile.doc.html#88659"" rel=""nofollow"">4.10 Limitations of the Java Virtual Machine</a> in <a href=""http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jvms/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Java Virtual Machine Specification, Second Edition</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Fix 1: refactor the class</strong></p>

<p>Since your class is being generated, this might not be an option. Still, it is worth looking at the options your class generation tool offers to see if it can produce something less troublesome.</p>

<p><strong>Fix 2: increase the stack size</strong></p>

<p>I think <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16935/ants-javac-tasks-throws-stackoverflowexception#16982"" rel=""nofollow"">Kieron</a> has one solution when he mentions the -Xss argument. <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javac.html"" rel=""nofollow"">javac</a> takes a number of non-standard arguments that will vary between versions and compiler vendors.</p>

<p>My compiler:</p>

<pre><code>$ javac -version
javac 1.6.0_05
</code></pre>

<p>To list all the options for it, I'd use these commands:</p>

<pre><code>javac -help
javac -X
javac -J-X
</code></pre>

<p>I <em>think</em> the stack limit for javac is 512Kb by default. You can increase the stack size for this compiler to 10Mb with this command:</p>

<pre><code>javac -J-Xss10M Foo.java
</code></pre>

<p>You might be able to pass this in an Ant file with a <em>compilerarg</em> element nested in your <em>javac</em> task.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;javac srcdir=""gen"" destdir=""gen-bin"" debug=""on"" fork=""true""&gt;
    &lt;compilerarg value=""-J-Xss10M"" /&gt;

<p>from the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16935/ants-javac-tasks-throws-stackoverflowexception/19782#19782"">comment above</a> is incorrect. You need a space between the -J and -X, like so:</p>

<p>Also, keep in mind that the mailto is considered the same as a URL of sorts and therefore will have the same limitations for length. See

If you expect to have a longer string than that then you'll need to look at alternatives.</p>

<p>BTW, you shouldn't have to resort to kicking out a script to do that as long as you can shell out a command from Java (I don't know if you can since I don't do Java).</p>

<p>You can prefill the subject line in the email by adding the subject preceded by '<strong>?subject=</strong>' after the email address. </p>

<p>So the link now becomes: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""mailto:someone@yoursite.com?subject=Mail from Our Site""&gt;Email Us&lt;/a&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2. Send to Multiple Recipients</strong> </p>

<p>Mail can be sent to additional recipients either as carbon copies (cc) or blind carbon copies (bcc). </p>

<p>This is done in a similar way, by placing '<strong>?cc=someoneelse@theirsite.com</strong>' after the initial address. </p>

<p>So the link looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""mailto:someone@yoursite.com?cc=someoneelse@theirsite.com""&gt;Email Us&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>cc can simply be replaced by bcc if you wish to send blind carbon copies. </p>

<p>This can be very useful if you have links on pages with different subjects. You might have the email on each page go to the appropriate person in a company but with a copy of all mails sent to a central address also. </p>

<p>You can of course specify more than one additional recipient, just separate your list of recipients with a comma. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""mailto:someone@yoursite.com?cc=someoneelse@theirsite.com, another@thatsite.com, me@mysite.com""&gt;Email Us&lt;/a&gt;

<p><strong>3. Combining Code</strong> </p>

<p>You can combine the various bits of code above by the addition of an '&amp;' between each.</p>

<p>Thus adding </p>

<pre><code>me@mysite.com?subject=Hello&amp;cc=you@yoursite.com&amp;bcc=her@hersite.com
</code></pre>

<p>would send an email with the subject 'Hello' to me, you and her. </p>

<p><strong>4. Write the Email</strong> </p>

<p>You can also prefill the body of the email with the start of a message, or write the whole message if you like! To add some thing to the body of the email it is again as simple as above - '<strong>?body=</strong>' after the email address. However formatting that email can be a little tricky. To create spaces between words you will have to use hex code - for example '<strong>%20</strong>' between each word, and to create new lines will mean adding '<strong>%0D</strong>'. Similarly symbols such as <strong>$</strong> signs will need to be written in hex code.</p>

<p>If you also wish to add a subject line and send copies to multiple recipients, this can make for a very long and difficult to write bit of code. </p>

<p>It will send a message to three people, with the subject and the message filled in, all you need to do is add your name. </p>

<p>Just look at the code! </p>

<p>Basically, I use:</p>

<pre><code>private String encodex(final String s) {
    try {
        return java.net.URLEncoder.encode(s, ""utf-8"").replaceAll(""\\+"", ""%20"").replaceAll(""\\%0A"", ""%0D%0A"");
    } catch (Throwable x) {
        return s;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The string that's passed in should be a string with \r\n, and stray \r already normalized to \n.</p>

<p>Also note that just returning the original string on an exception like above is only safe if the mailto URI argument you're passing on the command-line is properly escaped and quoted.</p>

<p>On windows that means:</p>

<ol>
<li>Quote the argument.</li>
<li>Escape any "" inside the quotes with \.</li>
<li>Escape any \ that precede a "" or the end of the string with \.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, on windows, if you're dealing with UTF-16 strings like in Java, you might want to use ShellExecuteW to ""open"" the mailto URI. If you don't and return s on an exception (where some hvalue isn't completely percent-encoded, you could end up narrowing some wide characters and losing information. But, not all mail clients accept unicode arguments, so ideally, you want to pass a properly percent-encoded-utf8 ascii argument with ShellExecute.</p>

<p>Like 'start', ShellExecute with ""open"" should open the mailto URI in the default client.</p>

<p>Running the command <strong>locale</strong> on your *nix box will tell you what the system locale is. If this is different to the encoding used in the text files that have been transferred over from the windows machine, then this can sometimes cause issues, depending on the usage of those files. You can use the very powerful <strong>recode</strong> command to try and convert between the different charsets as well as any line ending issues. <strong>recode -l</strong> will show you all of the formats and encodings that the tool can convert between. It is likely to be a VERY long list.</p>

<p>When writing to files or reading from files (that you are in control of), it is often worth specifying the encoding to use, as most Java methods allow this. However, also ensuring that the system locale matches can save a lot of pain.</p>

<p>Having said that, .NET also lacks stuff Java has. E.g. the ease of EJBs, frameworks that can compete with e.g. Spring etc. </p>

<p>I am a Java EE developer for over 10 years and lately, I must say I'm really beginning to dislike Java. Frameworks like JSF make my hair fall out. A bunch of open-source stuff like M2eclipse does not work well. A LOT of bugs in eclipse. Many eclipse packages that are not compatible with each other resulting in NullPointerExceptions in your error console, build problems etc etc.. Shoot me but I have lost my faith in open source. It does not work at a level you could call 'professional'.  I feel such is merele logical: in a company you have some pressure from people who will call the helpdesk, law-suits because stuff is bad etc and so some manager(s) will do the best they can to make sure all works together. Of course, software will always have bugs. However, when I compare my years as a C++ developer using Microsof Visual Studio against my years using Eclipse or Netbeans, I must dat Dev Studio gave me never headache. It always worked and I cannot remember it having crashed once... Eclipse? I could write a book!!</p>

<p>So I agree with what i read somewhere: while open-source may be free and costless, the loss in productivity is huge compared to what I had years ago...

<p>On the handsets that support JSR 75 FileConnection it may be valid alternative but without code signing it is an user experience nightmare. Almost every single API call will invoke a security prompt with no blanket permission choice.

<p>Developing a J2ME application for Blackberry without using the .cod compiler limits the use of JSR 75 some what since we can't sign the archive. As pointed out by Carlos this is a problem on any platform and I've had similar issues using the PIM part of it.

<p>I love this book in all 3 editions, and it was one of the books in a class I had as a Senior at UT, but it's just not a starting book.  You can become comfortable in C++ with a lot less, though you certainly won't be one with the compiler until you have read Meyer's work.  </p>

<p>I don't know if it's still in print but I found <strong>Navigating C++</strong> usefull, but I was also very comfortable with pointers from Pascal.  Err of course I am forgetting that 15 years ago you had to learn what OOP was, now it's a little more assumed.  So perhaps Meyer's is not out of line.  Thoughts? </p>

<p>In C++ you have pointers, which are more powerful (or less powerful depending on your interpretation of power) object references, which you already know about from Java.</p>

<p>In Java you might do this:</p>

<pre><code>Thing mything = new Thing(); // mything is an object reference
mything.method();

<p>In C++ you would do this:</p>

<pre><code>Thing * mything = new Thing(); // mything is an object pointer
mything-&gt;method();
delete mything;

<p>The syntactical difference is obvious: '->' instead of '.' when calling an object method from a pointer to an object. In C++, you have to free the memory explicitly when you are done with an object. At the end of the day you are doing the same thing in C++ and Java, instantiating objects and calling methods, putting useless semicolons at the end of every line, etc. Is it any wonder that Python is becoming so popular?:</p>

See the comments for an OSS Fork.</strong> <em>I still stand by my opinion that stuff like that (MMO Middleware) is realistic, you just need a company that doesn't suck behind it.</em></p>

<p>The Market may be dominated by few large games, but that does not mean that there is not a lot of room for more niche games. Lets face it: If you want to reach 100.000+ players, you're ending up building your own technology stack, at least for the critical core. That's what CCP did for EVE Online (<a href=""http://myeve.eve-online.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=584"">StacklessIO</a>), that's what Blizzard did for World of Warcraft (although they do use many third-party libraries), that's what Mythic did for Warhammer Online (although they are based on Gamebryo).</p>

<p>However, if you aim to be a small, niche MMO (like the dozens of Free-to-Play/Itemshop MMOs), then getting the Network stuff right is just insanely hard, data consistency is even harder and scalability is the biggest b*tch.</p>

<p>But game technology is not your only problem - you also need to tackle Billing. Credit Card only? Have fun selling in Germany then, people there want ELV. That's where you need a reliable billing provider, but you still need to wire in the billing application with your accounts to make sure that accounts are blocked/reactivated when the billing fails.</p>

<p>There are some companies already offering ""MMO Infratructure Services"" (i.e. <a href=""http://www.e-eis.com/cms/front_content.php?changelang=2"">Arvato's EEIS</a>), but the bottom line is: Stuff like Project Darkstar IS realistic, but assuming that you can build a Multi-Billion-MMO entirely on a Third Party Stack is optimistic, possibly idealistic.</p>

<p>But then again, entirely inventing all of the technology is even more stupid - use the Third Party stuff that you need (i.e. Billing, Font Rendering, Audio Output...), but <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001172.html"">write the stuff that really makes or breaks your business</a> (i.e. Network stack, User interface etc.) on your own. (Note: Jeff's posting may be <a href=""http://damilare.net/random-talks/dare-obasanjo-vs-jeff-atwood-on-html-validation/"">a bit flawed</a>, but the overall direction is correct IMHO.)</p>

<p>Addendum: Also, the game industry does license and reuse engines a lot. The most prominent game Engines are the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine"">Unreal Engine</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Engine"">Source Engine</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_tech"">id Tech</a>, which fuel dozens, if not hundreds of games. But there are some lesser-known (outside of the industry) engines. There is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebryo"">Gamebryo</a>, the Middleware behind games like Civilization 4 and Fallout 3, there was <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RenderWare"">RenderWare</a> that is now only EA-in-House, but used in games like Battlefield 2 or The Sims 3. There is the open source <a href=""http://www.ogre3d.org/"">Ogre3d</a>, which was used in <a href=""http://www.dtp-entertainment.com/en/games/game_detail.php?id=2973&amp;landid=1"">some</a> commercial <a href=""http://www.venetica-game.com/"">titles</a>. If you're just looking for Sound, there's stuff like <a href=""http://www.fmod.org/"">FMOD</a> or if you want to do font-rendering, why not give <a href=""http://www.freetype.org/"">FreeType</a> a spin?</p>

<p>What I'm saying is: Third-Party Engines/Middleware do exist, and they ARE being successfully used since more than a decade (I know for sure that id's Wolfenstein Engine was licensed to other companies, and that was 1992), even by big companies in multi-million-dollar titles. The important thing is the support, because a good engine with no help in case of an issue is pretty much worthless or at least very expensive if the developer has to spend their game-development-time with unneccessary debugging of the Engine.</p>

<p>If the Darkstar folks manage to get the support side right and 2 or 3 higher profile titles out, I do believe it could succeed in opening the MMO market to a lot more smaller developers and indies.</p>

<p>Our experiences is that you can potentially get much better performance than typical relational databases.</p>

<p>However, you really have to tweak your objects to get this kind of performance. For example, if you've got a list containing a lot of objects, DB4O activation of these lists is slow. There are a number of ways to get around this problem, for example, by inverting the relationship.</p>

<p>Another pain is activation. When you retrieve or delete an object from DB4O, by default it will activate the whole object tree. For example, loading a Foo will load Foo.Bar.Baz.Bat, etc until there's nothing left to load. While this is nice from a programming standpoint, performance will slow down the more nesting in your objects. To improve performance, you can tell DB4O how many levels deep to activate. This is time-consuming to do if you've got a lot of objects.</p>

<p>Another area of pain was text searching. DB4O's text searching is far, far slower than SQL full text indexing. (They'll tell you this outright on their site.) The good news is, it's easy to setup a text searching engine on top of DB4O. On our project, we've hooked up Lucene.NET to index the text fields we want.</p>

<p>Some APIs don't seem to work, such as the GetField APIs useful in applying database upgrades. (For example, you've renamed a property and you want to upgrade your existing objects in the database, you need to use these ""reflection"" APIs to find objects in the database. Other APIs, such as the [Index] attribute don't work in the stable 6.4 version, and you must instead specify indexes using the Configure().Index(""someField""), which is not strongly typed.</p>

<p>We've witnessed performance degrade the larger your database. We have a 1GB database right now and things are still fast, but not nearly as fast as when we started with a tiny database.</p>

<p>We've found another issue where Db4O.GetByID will close the database if the ID doesn't exist anymore in the database.</p>

<p>We've found the Native Query syntax (the most natural, language-integrated syntax for queries) is far, far slower than the less-friendly SODA queries. So instead of typing:</p>

<pre><code>// C# syntax for ""Find all MyFoos with Bar == 23"".
// (Note the Java syntax is more verbose using the Predicate class.)
IList&lt;MyFoo&gt; results = db4o.Query&lt;MyFoo&gt;(input =&gt; input.Bar == 23);
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of that nice query code, you have to an ugly SODA query which is string-based and not strongly-typed.</p>

<p>For .NET folks, they've recently introduced a LINQ-to-DB4O provider, which provides for the best syntax yet. However, it's yet to be seen whether performance will be up-to-par with the ugly SODA queries.</p>

<p>DB4O support has been decent: we've talked to them on the phone a number of times and have received helpful info. Their user forums are next to worthless, however, almost all questions go unanswered. Their JIRA bug tracker receives a lot of attention, so if you've got a nagging bug, file it on JIRA on it often will get fixed. (We've had 2 bugs that have been fixed, and another one that got patched in a half-assed way.)</p>

<p>If all this hasn't scared you off, let me say that we're very happy with DB4O, despite the problems we've encountered. The performance we've got has blown away some O/RM frameworks we tried. I recommend it.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I do want to catch a specific exception (as you seem to want to do). You'll probably find, however, that this is somewhat rare and that it is indicative of using exceptions to control logic -- which is inefficient (slow) and often frowned upon.</p>

<p>So using your example, if you want to run some special logic when the email server is not configured, you may want to add a method to the emailUtil object like:</p>

<p>public bool isEmailConfigured()</p>

<p>... call that first, instead of looking for a specific exception.</p>

<p>When an exception does happen, it really means that the situation was completely unexpected and the code can't handle it -- so the best you can do is report it to the user (or write it to a log or restart )</p>

<p>As for having an exception hierarchy vs exceptions-with-error-codes-in-them, I typically do the latter.

The status objects contain a severity enum (information, warning, error, ...) a status object name like ""Email Address"" and a user readable message like ""Badly formatted Email Address""</p>

<p>The calling code would then decide which to filter up to the UI and which to handle itself.</p>

<p>Personally, I think exceptions are strictly for when you can't implement a normal code solution.  The performance hit and handling restrictions are just a bit too much for me.</p>

<p>Another reason for using a list of status objects is that identifying multiple errors (such as during validation) is MUCH easier.  After all, you can only throw one exception which must be handled before moving on.  </p>

<p>Imagine a user submitting an email that had a malformed destination address and contained language that you are blocking.  Do you throw the malformed email exception, then, after they fix that and resubmit, throw a bad language exception?  From a user experience perspective dealing with all of them at once is a better way to go.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> combining answers</p>

<p>@Jonathan: My point was that I can evaluate the action, in this case sending an email, and send back multiple failure reasons. For example, ""bad email address"", ""blank message title"", etc..</p>

<p>With an exception, you're limited to just percolating the one problem then asking the user to resubmit at which point they find out about a second problem. This is really bad UI design.</p>

<p>Reinventing the wheel.. possibly. However, most applications should analyze the whole transaction in order to give the best possible information to the user. Imagine if your compiler stopped dead at the first error. You then fix the error and hit compile again only to have it stop again for a different error. What a pain in the butt. To me, that's exactly the problem with throwing exceptions and hence the reason I said to use a different mechanism.</p>

However, one big difference between the Java and Python approaches is that with reference counting in the common case (no circular references) objects are cleaned up immediately rather than at some indeterminate later date.</p>

<pre><code>def parse_some_attrs(fname):
    return open(fname).read().split(""~~~"")[2:4]
</code></pre>

<p>and the file descriptor for that file I opened will be cleaned up immediately because as soon as the reference to the open file goes away, the file is garbage collected and the file descriptor is freed.  Of course, if I run Jython or IronPython or possibly PyPy, then the garbage collector won't necessarily run until much later; possibly I'll run out of file descriptors first and my program will crash.</p>

<p>So you SHOULD be writing code that looks like</p>

<p>I'd say that the best garbage collector is the one with the best performance, which currently seems to be the Java-style generational garbage collectors that can run in a separate thread and has all these crazy optimizations, etc.  The differences to how you write your code should be negligible and ideally non-existent.</p>

In reference counting each time a reference is modified the object's involved have their count updated. Any object whose reference count gets set to zero is considered dead.</p>

<p>With basically all GC implementations there are trade offs but tracing is usually good for high through put (i.e. fast) operation but has longer pause times (larger gaps where the UI or program may freeze up).

<p>I presume that this is actualy the main cause of the jerky feeling of Android (based on Java), even on the most expensive cellphones, in comparision with the smoothness of iOS (based on ObjectiveC, and using RC). </p>

<p>I'd love to see a jvm option to enable RC memory management, and maybe keeping GC only to run as a last resort when there is no more memory left. </p>

<p>If you take a look at the source code of the class java.util.regex.Pattern, you'll see that it uses an internal representation of Node instances. Each of the different pattern components have their own implementation of a Node subclass. These Nodes are organised into a tree.</p>

  <p>Spolsky:  Yep.

It's $295, and it just generates some realistic test data.  And it does things like actually generate real cities in the city column that actually exist, and then when it generates those it'll get the state right, instead of getting the state wrong, or putting states into German cities and stuff like... you know, it generates pretty realistic looking data.  I'm not really sure what all the features are.</p>

<p>This is probably not what you are looking for, but it might be a good starting off point, instead of creating your own.</p>

<p>I can't seem to find anything in google, so I would suggest tackling the problem by parsing a given regular expression into the smallest units of work (\w, [x-x], \d, etc) and writing some basic methods to support those regular expression phrases.</p>

<p>So for \w you would have a method getRandomLetter() which returns any random letter, and you would also have getRandomLetter(char startLetter, char endLetter) which gives you a random letter between the two values.</p>

class MyReplacementClass {

  public static void $clinit{...} // replace static initializer
  public static void myStatic{...} // replace static method
  // etc...

import org.testng.annotations.Test;

With automated specification-based testing frameworks, you supply a specification of the method under test (a property about it that should be true) and the framework generates tests as well as mock objects, automatically.</p>

<p>For example, the following property tests the Math.sqrt method to see if the square root of any positive number n squared is equal to n.</p>

<pre><code>val propSqrt = forAll { (n: Int) =&gt; (n &gt;= 0) ==&gt; scala.Math.sqrt(n*n) == n }
</code></pre>

<p>When you call <code>propSqrt.check()</code>, ScalaCheck generates hundreds of integers and checks your property for each, also automatically making sure that the edge cases are covered well.</p>

<p>Even though ScalaCheck is written in Scala, and requires the Scala Compiler, it's easy to test Java code with it. The Reductio framework in Functional Java is a pure Java implementation of the same concepts.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_API_for_XML"" rel=""nofollow"">SAX</a>, where you use an <a href=""http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/org/xml/sax/helpers/DefaultHandler.html"" rel=""nofollow"">handler</a> to only grab what you want in your XML and ditch the rest</li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model"" rel=""nofollow"">DOM</a>, which parses your file all along, and allows you to grab all elements in a more tree-like fashion.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another very useful XML parsing method, albeit a little more recent than these ones, and included in the JRE only since Java6, is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StAX"" rel=""nofollow"">StAX</a>. StAX was conceived as a medial method between the tree-based of DOM and event-based approach of SAX. It is quite similar to SAX in the fact that parsing very large documents is easy, but in this case the application ""pulls"" info from the parser, instead of the parsing ""pushing"" events to the application. You can find more explanation on this subject <a href=""http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/09/17/stax.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you really need to pass a lcdui.Graphics to some underlying library to display its output then I would suggest this:</p>

<p>Somewhere in your component code (do only when the component contents really need to be changed):</p>

<pre><code>private Image buffer = null; // keep this

int[] bufferArray = new int[desiredWidth * desiredHeight];
javax.microedition.lcdui.Image bufferImage = 
    Image.createEmptyImage(desiredWidth, desiredHeight);
thirPartyComponent.paint(bufferImage.getGraphics());
bufferImage.getRGB(bufferArray,0,1,0,0,desiredWidth, desiredHeight);
bufferImage = null; //no longer needed
buffer = Image.createImage(bufferArray, desiredWidth, desiredHeight);

<p>In the component paint(g) method:</p>

<pre><code>g.drawImage(0,0, buffer);

<p>As far as your questions:
If I convert oldSet and newSet into HashMap (order is not of concern here), with the IDs as keys, would it made the code easier to read and easier to compare? How much of time &amp; memory performance is loss on the conversion?
I think that you would probably make the code more readable by using a Map BUT...you would probably use more memory and time during the conversion.</p>

<p>Would iterating the two sets and perform the appropriate operation be more efficient and concise?
Yes, this would be the best of both worlds especially if you followed @Mike Sharek 's advice of Rolling your own List with the specialized methods or following something like the Visitor Design pattern to run through your collection and process each item.</p>

  <p>Also, are they unique to Java, is there a C++ equivalent?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, but VB and C# have <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/dotnetattributes.aspx"">attributes</a> which are the same thing.</p>

<p>Their use is quite diverse. One typical Java example, <code>@Override</code> has no effect on the code but it can be used by the compiler to generate a warning (or error) if the decorated method doesn't actually override another method. Similarly, methods can be marked obsolete.</p>

<p>Then there's reflection. When you reflect a type of a class in your code, you can access the attributes and act according to the information found there. I don't know any examples in Java but in .NET this is used by the compiler to generate <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.serializableattribute.aspx"">(de)serialization</a> information for classes, determine the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.interopservices.structlayoutattribute.aspx"">memory layout</a> of structures and <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.interopservices.dllimportattribute.aspx"">declare function imports</a> from legacy libraries (among others). They also control how the IDE form designer works.</p>

<p>/EDIT: Attributes on classes are comparable to tag interfaces (like <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html"">Serializable</a> in Java). However, the .NET coding guidelines say not to use tag interfaces. Also, they only work on class level, not on method level.</p>

  <p>It can be to your advantage to use the

  general, the later you make the
  binding time, the more flexibility you
  build into your code. The next example
  shows binding at the earliest possible
  time, when the code is written:</p>
  
  <p>Java Example of a Variable That's
  Bound at Code-Writing Time
  titleBar.color = 0xFF; // 0xFF is hex
  value for color blue</p>
  
  <p>The value 0xFF is bound to the
  variable titleBar.color at the time
  the code is written because 0xFF is a
  literal value hard-coded into the
  program. Hard-coding like this is
  nearly always a bad idea because if
  this 0xFF changes, it can get out of
  synch with 0xFFs used elsewhere in the
  code that must be the same value as
  this one.</p>

I use it and have some fondness for it, with great hopes for its future.  I think the next release (2.0) to be delivered in JEE6 will really bring it into its own, with a new template syntax (similar to Facelets) and a simplified component model (custom components in only 1 file... finally).</p>

<p>And, of course, there are a million smaller frameworks and tools that get their own following (<a href=""http://velocity.apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Velocity</a> for basic needs, raw <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages"" rel=""nofollow"">JSPs</a>, Struts, etc).  I generally prefer component oriented frameworks myself, though.  </p>

<p>In the end, I'd recommend just taking a look at Tapestry, Wicket, and JSF and just picking the one that feels the best to you.  You'll probably find one that just fits the way you like to work very quickly.</p>

My experience is with Tapestry 4, not 5, so your mileage may vary. My opinion of Tapestry has changed over the years; I have modified this post to reflect it.</p>

<p>I can no longer recommend Tapestry as I did previously. Tapestry 5 appears to be a significant improvement, but my main issue with Tapestry is not with platform itself; it's with the people behind it.</p>

<p>Historically, every major version update of Tapestry has broken backwards compatibility with extreme prejudice, far more than one might expect. This seems to be due to the incorporation of new coding techniques or technologies that require significant rewrites.</p>

<p>Howard Lewis Ship (the principal author of Tapestry) is certainly a brilliant developer, but I can't say I care for his management of the Tapestry project. Development of Tapestry 5 began almost immediately after Tapestry 4 shipped. From what I can tell, Ship pretty much devoted himself to that, leaving Tapestry 4 in the hands of other contributors, who I feel are not nearly as capable as Ship. After having made the painful switch from Tapestry 3 to Tapestry 4, I felt that I had been abandoned almost immediately.</p>

<p>Of course, with the release of Tapestry 5, Tapestry 4 became a legacy product. I wouldn't have a problem with this if the upgrade path wasn't so brutal <strong>again</strong>. So now our development team is in the rather unenviable position: We could continue to use an essentially abandoned web platform (Tapestry 4), make the heinous upgrade to Tapestry 5, or give up on Tapestry entirely and rewrite our application using another platform. None of these options is very attractive.</p>

<p>Tapestry 5 is supposedly written so as to reduce the likelihood of update breakage from this point forward. A good example is in the page classes: in previous incarnations, page classes descended from a base class provided by Tapestry; incompatible API changes in this class were the cause of a large number of backward compatibility problems. In Tapestry 5, pages are POJOs which are enhanced at runtime with the ""magic Tapestry fairy dust"" via annotations. So as long as the contract for the annotations is maintained, changes to Tapestry won't affect your page classes.</p>

<p>If this is right, then writing a new application using Tapestry 5 could turn out well. But personally, I don't feel like putting my hand on the burner again.</p>

<p>Spring MVC would be a candidate, but since Spring MVC 3 it has a strange annotation overloaded programming model which doesn't use the benefits of static typing. There ore other ugly things like output parameters in methods combined with a usual return, so there are two output channels of one method. Spring MVC also tends to reeinvent the wheel and you'll have more to configure compared to other frameworks. I cannot really recommend Spring MVC though it has some nice ideas.</p>

<p>Grails is a convenient way to use Spring MVC and other established frameworks like Hibernate. Coding is fun and you'll quickly see results.</p>

The major difference is the ability to gracefully handle malformed HTML. </p>

<p>The best part is that it actually unit tests for all the XSS attacks on the above site. Besides, what could be easier than this API call:</p>

<pre><code>public String toSafeHtml(String html) throws ScanException, PolicyException {

    Policy policy = Policy.getInstance(POLICY_FILE);
    AntiSamy antiSamy = new AntiSamy();
    CleanResults cleanResults = antiSamy.scan(html, policy);
    return cleanResults.getCleanHTML().trim();
}

However, if string manipulation works for you, then go for it! There are plenty of cases where small or simple XML text can be safely built by hand.</p>

<p>Just be aware that creating XML text is harder than it looks. Here's some criteria I would consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>First: how much <em>control</em> do you have on the information that goes into the xml?</li>
</ul>

<p>The less control you have on the source data, the more likely you will have trouble, and the more advantageous the library becomes. For example: (a) Can you <em>guarantee</em> that the element names will never have a character that is illegal in a name? (b) How about quotes in an attribute's content? Can they happen, and are you handling them? (c) Does the data ever contain anything that might need to be encoded as an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_entity"" rel=""nofollow"">entity</a> (like the less-than which often needs to be output as <strong>&amp;lt;</strong>); are you doing it correctly?</p>

<ul>
<li>Second, maintainability: is the code that builds the XML easy to understand <em>by someone else</em>?</li>
</ul>

<p>You probably don't want to be stuck with the code for life. I've worked with second-hand C++ code that hand-builds XML and it can be surprisingly obscure. Of course, if this is a personal project of yours, then you don't need to worry about ""others"": substitute ""in a year"" for ""others"" above.</p>

<p>I wouldn't worry about performance. If your XML is simple enough that you can hand-write it, any overhead from the library is probably meaningless. Of course, your case might be different, but you should measure to prove it first.</p>

<p>Finally, Yes; you can hand build XML text by hand if it's simple enough; but not knowing the libraries available is <em>probably</em> not the right reason.</p>

<p>A modern XML library is a quite powerful tool, but it can also be daunting. However, learning the essentials of your XML library is not that hard, and it can be quite handy; among other things, it's almost a requisite in today's job marketplace. Just don't get bogged down by namespaces, schemas and other fancier features until you get the essentials.</p>

<p>It wouldn't make sense in this context to use the array argument as in <code>Collection.toArray( T[] )</code>. The only reason an array is used there is because the same (pre-allocated) array is used to contain the results (if the array is large enough to fit them all in). This saves on allocating a new array at run-time all the time.</p>

<p>However, for the purposes of education, if you did want to use the array typing, the syntax is very similar:</p>

  return new ArrayList&lt;T&gt;();

This approach allows XML integration between applications while the MT (FIN) format will continue to be transported over the SWIFT network.""</p>

<p>Java source code will also be made available, again from the doc:
""Working sample Java source code that converts a message in MT format to an XML instance and from an XML instance to a message in MT format.""</p>

<p>Master pages give the ability to define pages in terms of content slotted into a master template.</p>

<p>Master pages are a feature of ASP.Net (the .Net web framework), so you are looking for a feature similar to master pages in a Java web framework.  </p>

<p><a href=""http://tiles.apache.org/tutorial/basic/pages.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiles.apache.org/tutorial/basic/pages.html</a> gives some basic examples using Tiles and JSP to implement something similar with Struts, a Java web framework.

<p>Velocity is a generic templating engine, not specialized for web pages and definitely more complicated than you need.  (I've seen it used for code generation.)</p>

<p>Tapestry is more of a full featured web stack than Tile, and is probably good for your purposes.  Its templating functionality involves creating a component and putting all common markup in that.  An example is at <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/articles/tapestry5-intro"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/articles/tapestry5-intro</a>.</p>

<p>The Facelets <code>&lt;ui:insert/&gt;</code> tag is comparable to the ASP.NET <code>&lt;asp:ContentPlaceHolder/&gt;</code> tag used in master pages; it lets you provide default content for that area of the page, but this can be overridden.</p>

<p>To fill the Facelets template in another page, you start with a <code>&lt;ui:composition/&gt;</code> element that points to the template file.  This is roughly equivalent to declaring the MasterPageFile attribute in an ASP.NET page.</p>

<p>Inside the <code>&lt;ui:composition/&gt;</code> element, you use <code>&lt;ui:define/&gt;</code> elements to override the template defaults, similar to the way an <code>&lt;asp:Content/&gt;</code> tag is used.  These elements can contain any kind of content - from simple strings to JSF elements.</p>

<p>So, to bring it all together...</p>

<p>In <em>master.xhtml</em>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- HTML header content here --&gt;
&lt;ui:insert name=""AreaOne""&gt;Default content for AreaOne&lt;/ui:insert&gt;
&lt;ui:insert name=""AreaTwo""&gt;Default content for AreaTwo&lt;/ui:insert&gt;
&lt;!-- HTML footer content here --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In <em>page.xhtml</em>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ui:composition template=""/WEB-INF/templates/master.xhtml""&gt;
  &lt;ui:define name=""AreaOne""&gt;Here is some new content&lt;/ui:define&gt;
  &lt;ui:define name=""AreaTwo""&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some new content here too&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/ui:define&gt;
&lt;/ui:composition&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And this will render as:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- HTML header content here --&gt;
Here is some new content
&lt;p&gt;Some new content here too&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- HTML footer content here --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You also get some other benefits with Facelets, such as the ability to reuse page components with different data.</p>

<p>InPUT is probably more powerful than most use cases require, as it allows for the <strong>programming language independent formulation</strong> of experimental data (input - output), with features such as the definition of <strong>complex descriptor to class mappings</strong>, or randomized configuration spawning and validation based on predefined value ranges (for test and research, e.g. Monte Carlo simulations). You can <strong>define parameters with sub parameters, relative restrictions on parameter values (numerical param a > param b)</strong> etc. .</p>

<p>Its still in beta, but rather stable, I use it for my research, for the <strong>configuration and documentation of experiments, and for teaching purposes</strong>. Once it is available for other languages (C++ adapter in the pipe), other researchers/practitioners can reuse the descriptors running their implementations of the same algorithms in C++ (using the code mapping concept). That way, <strong>experimental results can be validated/programs can be migrated more easily</strong>. The documentation is still in working process, but a couple of <strong>examples are available</strong> on the page. InPUT is <strong>open source</strong> software.</p>

Both are nice but I thought Netbeans had a leg up because it doesn't use any proprietary way of saving the GUI structure and instead does something similar to what Visual Studio does - auto-generating the code that you can then add to. IDEA stores the information in a separate file which means you have to use IDEA to edit the layout visually later.</p>

I think it satisfies what most people are looking for in a visual editor and leaves it flexible enough to plug the holes manually through code without affecting the visual editor (so you can switch back and forth between code and design views without breaking either).</p>

In the project I used it on, it was wonderful to avoid reading or scrolling through the layout code (because that code no longer existed). Most of our hand-written code concerned itself with connecting events to actions, simply asking the layout for the relevant controls.</p>

<p>It's a crime that code generation is the default way to layout code in Java because better ways of doing GUIs have been around for decades. I have used Matisse, the NetBeans GUI code generator. While Matisse (now known as ""<a href=""http://netbeans.org/features/java/swing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Swing GUI Builder</a>"") makes it pleasant to layout components, it is similar to all other code generation tools because when you use Matisse you must live in constant fear that someone else edited the ""you cannot edit this in NetBeans"" GUI sections outside of NetBeans. As soon as you touch the layout builder again it could destroy their work and then you have a broken GUI. There might be some simple task like re-ordering a variable initialization and its use or re-naming a variable (this was especially a problem when using Matisse's database feature). You know how to do this by editing the un-editable source code but may waste time trying to figure out how to do the same thing in the GUI builder. Like most code generation tools, it might get you started, but eventually you will have to maintain the generated code yourself.</p>

<p>For example, we have a lot of components without public no-arg constructor (e.g. a JTable subclass which requires the model in the constructor) or we have component factories.</p>

<p>Desktop applications usually have to be obfuscated. Obfuscation very easily breaks user interfaces created with a GUI designer or requires much work to avoid obfuscating such classes.</p>

<p>Another often happening case is that, for example, a panel should only contain some components depending on some condition. Simply hiding them would make the GUI look bad; they rather should not be added instead.

You can use the GUI builder to prototype GUIs right in front of customers.</p>

<p><strong>Intuitive and Customizable</strong>
You can choose whether the GUI code should be generated with fully qualified or simple class names. The helpbar displays context-sensitive hints about what can be done with the selected component and suggests shortcuts that can speed up your work in the future. The NetBeans IDE also comes with built-in support for GUI localization and accessibility.</p>

<p><strong>Standard and Custom GUI Components</strong>
The extensible Component Palette comes with pre-installed Swing and AWT components and includes a visual menu designer. Use the Component Inspector to view a component's tree and properties.</p>

<p><strong>Beans Binding technology (JSR 295) Support</strong>
Take advantage of Beans Binding technology and the Java Persistence API to create Swing applications more easily. Using the Bind dialog box, you can quickly generate bindings for JavaBeans components.</p>

Debug a Swing GUI application without looking into the source code and control the execution flow in terms of high-level structures.

Somebody created an [sic] InvalidArguementException that parallels java.lang.IllegalArgumentException, and we now use it in (literally) hundreds of classes. Both indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument. Talk about a waste...</p>

<p>Joshua Bloch covers this in <em>Effective Java Programming Language Guide</em> [my bible of first resort on Best Practices] <strong>Chapter 8. Exceptions</strong> <em>Item 42: Favor the use of standard exceptions</em>. Here's a bit of what he says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reusing preexisting exceptions has several benefits. Chief among these, it makes your API easier to learn and use because <strong>it matches established conventions with which programmers are already familiar</strong> [<em>my emphasis, not Bloch's</em>]. A close second is that programs using your API are easier to read because they aren't cluttered with unfamiliar exceptions. Finally, fewer exception classes mean a smaller memory footprint and less time spent loading classes.</p>
  
  <p>The most commonly reused exception is IllegalArgumentException. This is generally the exception to throw when the caller passes in an argument whose value is inappropriate. For example, this would be the exception to throw if the caller passed a negative number in a parameter representing the number of times some action were to be repeated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That said, you should <strong>never</strong> throw Exception itself. Java has a well-chosen, diverse and well-targeted bunch of built-in exceptions that cover most situations <strong>AND</strong> describe the exception that occurred well enough so that you can remedy the cause.</p>

<p>Be friendly to the programmers who have to maintain your code in the future.</p>

<p>So, be careful trying to wrap an <code>Enumeration</code> as an <code>Iterable</code>. If someone passes me an <code>Iterable</code>, I will assume that I can call <code>iterator()</code> on it repeatedly, creating as many <code>Iterator</code> instances as I want, and iterating independently on each. A wrapped <code>Enumeration</code> will not fulfill this contract; don't let your wrapped <code>Enumeration</code> escape from your own code.

<p>There is no <code>Enumerable</code> equivalent to <code>Iterable</code>. It could be added without breaking anything to work in for loops, but what would be the point?

I use:</p>

<li><strong>unchecked exception</strong> within the code of my method for a <strong>failure due to the caller</strong> (that involves an <strong><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/61604/api-documentation-and-value-limits-do-they-match"">explicit and complete documentation</a></strong>)</li>
<li><strong>checked exception</strong> for a <strong>failure due to the <a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/callee"">callee</a></strong> that I need to make explicit to anyone wanting to use my code</li>

<p>Compare to the previous answer, this is a clear rationale (upon which one can agree or disagree) for the use of one or the other (or both) kind of exceptions.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>For both of those exceptions, I will create my own unchecked and checked Exception for my application (a good practice, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33497/how-do-i-recover-from-an-unchecked-exception#33564"">as mentionned here</a>), except for very common unchecked exception (like NullPointerException)</p>

<p>So for instance, the goal of this particular function below is to make (or get if already exist) an object,<br />
meaning:</p>

<ul>
<li>the container of the object to make/get MUST exist (responsibility of the CALLER<br />
=> unchecked exception, AND clear javadoc comment for this called function)</li>
<li>the other parameters can not be null<br />
(choice of the coder to put that on the CALLER: the coder will not check for null parameter but the coder DOES DOCUMENT IT)</li>
<li>the result CAN NOT BE NULL<br />
(responsibility and choice of the code of the callee, choice which will be of great interest for the caller<br />
=> checked exception because every callers MUST take a decision if the object can not be created/found, and that decision must be enforced at the compilation time: they can not use this function without having to deal with this possibility, meaning with this <em>checked</em> exception).  </li>

<p><strong>Unchecked exceptions</strong> are used to let the system <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast"">fail fast</a> which is a good thing. You should clearly state what is your method expecting in order to work properly.  This way you can validate the input only once.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @params operation - The operation to execute.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the operation is ""exit""
 */
 public final void execute( String operation ) {
     if( ""exit"".equals(operation)){

     }
     this.operation = operation; 
     .....  
 }
 private void secretCode(){
      // we perform the operation.
      // at this point the opreation was validated already.
      // so we don't worry that operation is ""exit""
      .....  
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Just to put an example. The point is, if the system fails fast, then you'll know where and why it did fail.  You'll get an stacktrace like:</p>

<pre><code> IllegalArgumentException: I told you not to use ""exit"" 
 at some.package.AClass.execute(Aclass.java:5)
 at otherPackage.Otherlass.delegateTheWork(OtherClass.java:4569)
 ar ......
</code></pre>

<p>And you'll know what happened. The OtherClass in the ""delegateTheWork"" method ( at line 4569 ) called your class with the ""exit"" value, even when it shouldn't  etc.</p>

<p>Otherwise you would have to sprinkle validations all over your code and that's error prone. Plus, sometimes it is hard to track what went wrong and you may expect hours of frustrating  debugging </p>

<p>Same thing happens with NullPointerExceptions. If you have a 700 lines class with some 15 methods, that uses 30 attributes and none of them can be null, instead of validating in each of those methods for nullability you could make all those attributes read-only and validate them in the constructor or factory method.</p>

<pre><code> public static MyClass createInstane( Object data1, Object data2 /* etc */ ){ 
      if( data1 == null ){ throw NullPointerException( ""data1 cannot be null""); }

  }


  // the rest of the methods don't validate data1 anymore.
  public void method1(){ // don't worry, nothing is null 
      ....
  }
  public void method2(){ // don't worry, nothing is null 
      ....
  }
  public void method3(){ // don't worry, nothing is null

<p><strong>Checked exceptions</strong> Are useful when the programmer ( you or your co-workers ) did everything right, validated the input, ran tests, and all the code is perfect, but the code connects to a third party webservice that may be down ( or a file you were using  was deleted by another external process etc ) . The webservice may even be validate before the connection is attempted, but during the data transfer something went wrong.</p>

<p>In that scenario there is nothing that you or your co-workers can do to help it. But still you have to do something and not let the application just die and disappear in the eyes of the user.  You use a checked exception for that and handle the exception, what can you do when that happens?, most of the time , just to attempt to log the error, probably save your work ( the app work ) and present a message to the user. ( The site blabla is down, please retry later etc. ) </p>

<p>If the checked exception are overused ( by  adding the ""throw Exception"" in the all the methods signatures ) , then your code will become very fragile, because everyone will ignore that exception ( because is too general ) and the quality of code will be seriously compromised.</p>

<p>If you overuse unchecked exception something similar will happen. The users of that code don't know if something may go wrong an a lot of try{...}catch( Throwable t ) will appear.</p>

<p><code>equals()</code> (<a href=""http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals(java.lang.Object)"">javadoc</a>) must define an equality relation (it must be <em>reflexive</em>, <em>symmetric</em>, and <em>transitive</em>). In addition, it must be <em>consistent</em> (if the objects are not modified, then it must keep returning the same value). Furthermore, <code>o.equals(null)</code> must always return false.</p>

<p><code>hashCode()</code> (<a href=""http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode()"">javadoc</a>) must also be <em>consistent</em> (if the object is not modified in terms of <code>equals()</code>, it must keep returning the same value).</p>

<p>The relation between the two methods is:</p>

<p><em>Whenever <code>a.equals(b)</code>, then <code>a.hashCode()</code> must be same as <code>b.hashCode()</code>.</em></p>

<h3>In practice:</h3>

<p>If you override one, then you should override the other.</p>

<p>Use the same set of fields that you use to compute <code>equals()</code> to compute <code>hashCode()</code>.</p>

An example:</p>

<pre><code>public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    // ...

    public int hashCode() {
        return new HashCodeBuilder(17, 31). // two randomly chosen prime numbers
            // if deriving: appendSuper(super.hashCode()).
            append(name).
            append(age).
            toHashCode();
    }

    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (obj == null)
            return false;
        if (obj == this)
            return true;
        if (!(obj instanceof Person))
            return false;

        Person rhs = (Person) obj;
        return new EqualsBuilder().
            // if deriving: appendSuper(super.equals(obj)).

<p>This statement is the result of equals() being inheritance unfriendly. The JLS (Java language specification) specifies that if A.equals(B)==true then B.equals(A) must also return true. If you omit that statement inheriting classes that override equals() (and change it's behavior) will break this specification.</p>

<p>Consider the following example of what happens when the statement is omitted:</p>

<pre><code>    class A {
      int field1;

      A(int field1) {
        this.field1 = field1;
      }

      public boolean equals(Object other) {
        return (other != null &amp;&amp; other instanceof A &amp;&amp; ((A) other).field1 == field1);
      }
    }

    class B extends A {
        int field2;

        B(int field1, int field2) {
            super(field1);
            this.field2 = field2;
        }

        public boolean equals(Object other) {
            return (other != null &amp;&amp; other instanceof B &amp;&amp; ((B)other).field2 == field2 &amp;&amp; super.equals(other));
        }
    }    
</code></pre>

<p>Doing new A(1).equals(new A(1)) Also, new B(1,1).equals(new B(1,1)) result give out true, as it should.</p>

<p>This looks all very good, but look what happens if we try to use both classes:</p>

<pre><code>A a = new A(1);
B b = new B(1,1);
a.equals(b) == true;
b.equals(a) == false;
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, this is wrong.</p>

<p>If you want to ensure the symmetric condition. a=b if b=a and the Liskov substitution principle call <code>super.equals(other)</code> not only in the case of B instance, but check after for A instance.............</p>

<pre><code>if (other instanceof B )
   return (other != null &amp;&amp; ((B)other).field2 == field2 &amp;&amp; super.equals(other)); 
if (other instanceof A) return super.equals(other); 
   else return false;
</code></pre>

<p>Which will output:
    a.equals(b) == true;
    b.equals(a) == true;</p>

<p>Where, if 'a' is not a reference of B, then it might be a be a reference of class A (because you extend it), in this case you call super.equals() TOO.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>

<p>In his book <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0201310058"">Effective Java Programming Language Guide</a> (Addison-Wesley, 2001), Joshua Bloch claims that ""There is simply no way to extend an instantiable class and add an aspect while preserving the equals contract.""  Tal disagrees.</p>

<p>His solution is to implement equals() by calling another nonsymmetric blindlyEquals() both ways.  blindlyEquals() is overridden by subclasses, equals() is inherited, and never overridden.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>class Point {
    private int x;
    private int y;
    protected boolean blindlyEquals(Object o) {
        if (!(o instanceof Point))
            return false;
        Point p = (Point)o;
        return (p.x == this.x &amp;&amp; p.y == this.y);
    }
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        return (this.blindlyEquals(o) &amp;&amp; o.blindlyEquals(this));
    }
}

class ColorPoint extends Point {
    private Color c;
    protected boolean blindlyEquals(Object o) {
        if (!(o instanceof ColorPoint))
            return false;
        ColorPoint cp = (ColorPoint)o;
        return (super.blindlyEquals(cp) &amp;&amp; 
        cp.color == this.color);
    }
}

If you didn't think this was unreasonably complicated already!</p>

<p><strong>Lazy loaded objects are subclasses</strong></p>

<p>If your objects are persisted using an ORM, in many cases you will be dealing with dynamic proxies to avoid loading object too early from the data store. These proxies are implemented as subclasses of your own class. This means that<code>this.getClass() == o.getClass()</code> will return false. For example:</p>

<pre><code>Person saved = new Person(""John Doe"");
Long key = dao.save(saved);
dao.flush();
Person retrieved = dao.retrieve(key);
saved.getClass().equals(retrieved.getClass()); // Will return false if Person is loaded lazy
</code></pre>

<p><em>If you're dealing with an ORM using <code>o instanceof Person</code> is the only thing that will behave correctly.</em></p>

<p><strong>Lazy loaded objects have null-fields</strong></p>

<p>ORMs usually use the getters to force loading of lazy loaded objects. This means that <code>person.name</code> will be null if <code>person</code> is lazy loaded, even if <code>person.getName()</code> forces loading and returns ""John Doe"". In my experience, this crops up more often in <code>hashCode</code> and <code>equals</code>.</p>

<p><em>If you're dealing with an ORM, make sure to always use getters, and never field references in <code>hashCode</code> and <code>equals</code>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Saving an object will change it's state</strong></p>

<p>Persistent objects often use a <code>id</code> field to hold the key of the object. This field will be automatically updated when an object is first saved. Don't use an id field in <code>hashCode</code>. But you can use it in <code>equals</code>.</p>

<p>A pattern I often use is</p>

<pre><code>if (this.getId() == null) {
    return this == other;
} else {
    return this.getId() == other.getId();
}
</code></pre>

<p>But: You cannot include <code>getId()</code> in <code>hashCode()</code>. If you do, when an object is persisted, it's <code>hashCode</code> changes. If the object is in a <code>HashSet</code>, you'll ""never"" find it again.</p>

<p>In my <code>Person</code> example, I probably would use <code>getName()</code> for <code>hashCode</code> and <code>getId</code> plus <code>getName()</code> (just for paranoia) for <code>equals</code>. It's okay if there are some risk of ""collisions"" for <code>hashCode</code>, but never okay for <code>equals</code>.</p>

<p><em><code>hashCode</code> should use the non-changing subset of properties from <code>equals</code></em></p>

   ...
   &lt;target name=""jar""&gt;
      ...
      &lt;jar jarfile=""${ant.project.name}.jar"" ...

<p>Structure your source directory structure so that you can package your build by copying whole directories, rather than naming individual files. For example, if you are copying JAR files to a web application archive, do something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;copy todir=""${war}/WEB-INF/lib"" flatten=""true""&gt;
   &lt;fileset dir=""lib"" includes=""**/*.jar""&gt;

By doing so you make your application behaviour unpredictable and tied to when the JVM is going to GC your object.

<p>I second the opinion of explicitly closing handles in a predictable orderly matter. Basically code for dealing with resources should follow the pattern:</p>

<p>SomeStream s = null;

try{
   s = openStream();
   ....
   s.io();

<p>It gets even more complicated if you write your own classes that work via JNI and open handles. You need to make sure handles are closed (released) and that it will happen only once. Frequently overlooked OS handle in Desktop J2SE is Graphics[2D]. Even BufferedImage.getGrpahics() can potentially return you the handle that points into a video driver (actually holding the resource on GPU). If you won't release it yourself and leave it  garbage collector to do the work - you may find strange OutOfMemory and alike situation when you ran out of video card mapped bitmaps but still have plenty of memory. In my experience it happens rather frequently in tight loops working with graphics objects (extracting thumbnails, scaling, sharpening you name it).</p>

<p>Basically GC does not take care of programmers responsibility of correct resource management. It only takes care of memory and nothing else. The Stream.finalize calling close() IMHO would be better implemented throwing exception new RuntimeError(""garbage collecting the stream that is still open""). It will save hours and days of debugging and cleaning code after the sloppy amateurs left the ends lose.</p>

<p>finalize() is a means to execute final bit of code just before the object is ready for garbage collection ( when the object has no strong reference to it).</p>

<p>So when should it be used?
Only in the present two cases:</p>

<ol>
<li>As a safety to make sure that some service is closed down or some
desired final change is made. For example InputStream class uses it
to close down the i/o stream. That is for example you have made an
instance of BufferedInputStream. Manually after using it one is
suppose to close() it. But because one can forget to do that,
finalize() act’s as a safety net to close() the stream. </li>
<li>While
using Native’s. Because garbage collector has no control over native
objects, finalize() can be used as a means to reclaim it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Apart from the above two cases never use it. To understand why? we need to understand the functioning and lifecycle of an object.</p>

<p>Introduction: There is a separate daemon thread called as finalizer thread which is responsible for calling finalize() method . Finalization queue is the queu where objects which are ready to be called finalize() method are placed.</p>

<ol>
<li>When an Object is created, JVM checks if the object has a finalize() method. If it has then it internally notes that this particular object has finalize() method.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>When an object is ready for garbage collection, then the garbage collector thread checks if this particular object has finalize() from table mentioned in (1).</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>2a)    If it doesn’t then it is sent for garbage collection.</p>

<p>2b) It is has, then it is added to the finalization queue. And it removes the entry of the object from the table (1).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Finalizer thread keeps polling the queue. For every object in the queue, its finalize() method is called. After calling the finalize() cycle from (2) is again repeated. If this object still has no strong reference, then sent for GC. If
    it has then ALWAYS (2a) is called because the entry was deleted in (2b)</p>

<pre><code>Basically finalize() method is only called once.
</code></pre>

<p>So what’s the issue with the above cycle?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From (1). Its take extra time in object creation. Memory allocation in Java is 5x to 10x faster than malloc/calloc etc. All the time gained is lost in the procedure of noting the object in the table etc. I once tried it. Create 100000 objects in a loop and measure the time taken for program to terminate in 2 cases: One with no finalize(), Second with finalize(). Found it to be 20% faster.</p>
  
  <p>From (2b): Memory Leakage and Starvation. If the object in the queue has references to a lot of memory resources, then all those objects wont get freed unless this object is ready for GC.If all the objects are heavy weight objects, then there can be a shortage.</p>
  
  <p>From (2b): Because finalize() is called only once, what if in teh finalize() you had a strong reference to “this” object. Next time the object’s finalie() is never called hence can leave the object in an inconsistent state.</p>
  
  <p>If inside finalize() an exception is thrown, it is ignored.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You do not know when finalize() is called as you have no control over when GC is called. Sometimes it might happen that you are printing the  value’s in finalize() but the output is never shown, because your program might have got terminated by the time finalize() is called.</p>

<p>Hence avoid using it. Instead create a method say dispose() which will close the necessory resources or for final log etc.

<p>One problem with your question is that you don't mention what what form your data is in to begin with. If your list of pairs happened to be a list of Map.Entry objects it would be pretty easy.</p>

<p>Just to throw this out, there is a (much maligned) class named java.util.Properties that is an extension of Hashtable. It expects only String keys and values and lets you load and store the data using files or streams. The format of the file it reads and writes is as follows:</p>

<p>I think the primary consideration is how to ensure that a given voter votes only once. At a paper poll, each registered voter is restricted to a particular booth/location and verification is done by name+SSN and a signature.</p>

<p>You might need a high resolution digital signature capture and therefore a touchscreen capture peripheral or a touch screen terminal.  A more sophisticated approach would be a biometric scanner, but that would require government records of thumb/finger prints or retinal scan - I can already see the privacy advocates lining up at the lawyer's offices.</p>

<p>Another approach would be for the voter ""registrar office"" to issue digital keys to each voter prior to the election - a (relatively) short (cryptographically strong) random alpha/numeric key that is entered with the voter's name and/or SSN into the application. Knowledge of that key is required for that particular voter in that particular election.  These keys would be issued by post in tamper-evident envelopes, like those used by banks for postal confirmation of wire transfers and delivery of PIN numbers.  The key must include checksum data so that the user can have the entry of it immediately validated and it should be in groups of 4, so something like XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-CCCC.</p>

<p>Any other ""secret"" knowledge, such as SSN, is likely too easily discovered for a large percentage of the population (though we don't seem to be able to make credit-granting organizations understand this), and therefore is unsuitable for authentication.</p>

<p>Vote counting can be done by generating a public key encrypted data file which is transferred (by sneaker net?) to the central system.  This must include the ""voting booth"" identity information and a record for each voter including their SSN and the digital key (or signature, or biometric data).  Votes with invalid keys are eliminated.  Multiple votes with the same key and same votes are treated as a single vote for that candidate.  Multiple votes with the same key and different votes are flagged for fraud investigation (with the constituent contacted by phone, issued a new key, and directed to revote).</p>

<p>Architecture is following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Client computer has a cryptography package.  </li>
<li>Dirty serwer that stores <em>encrypted</em> user input and output</li>
<li>Clean serwer that is not accesible from outside that stores keys and decrypted data. </li>
</ol>

<p>Users are issued cryptography cards (you may want to use something less safe - eg. pgp), and are required by jsp pages to encrypt with them all input. Page contains component that connects to cryctography app, asks user for key passphrase, encrypts it with server public key and signs it with user private key, then submits. </p>

<li>Don't show me syntax that Java can already do (if statements, loops etc) or if you do make it quick. It's as boring as hell to watch someone walk through language syntax 101 for 20min.
<ul>
<li>For syntax that has a comparible feature in Java maybe show them side by side quickly.</li>
<li>For syntax that is not in Java (closures etc) you can talk to them in a bit more detail.</li>

<li>Remember those examples from the first point. Show me one, fully working (or at least looking like it is).</li>

<p>I'm not sure about how the Java6 scripting support works but I'm fairly sure it can be made secure. I remember something about defining the API the script can use before it's run.</p>

<p>If this is the case then an example you could show would be some thick-client application (e.g. a music player) where users can write their own scripts with an API you provide them in Groovy which allows them to script their app in interesting and secure ways (e.g. creating custom columns in the playlist)</p>

<p>The stream format for Java serialization is defined <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/pdf/serial-spec.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">in this document</a>, but you need access to the original class definitions (and a Java runtime to load them into) to turn the stream data back into something approaching the original objects.

<p>Can't you just simply reference Java log4j libraries in your own java process? I'm just giving general advice here that is applicable to any pair of languages (name of the question is pretty language agnostic so I just provided one of the generic solutions).

The Java Serialization, like pretty much everything in Javaland, is standardized. So, you <em>could</em> implement a deserializer according to that standard in Python. However, the Java Serialization format is not designed for cross-language use, the serialization format is closely tied to the way objects are represented inside the JVM. While implementing a JVM in Python is surely a fun exercise, it's probably not what you're looking for (-:</p>

<p>There are other (data) serialization formats that are specifically designed to be language agnostic. They usually work by stripping the data formats down to the bare minimum (number, string, sequence, dictionary and that's it) and thus requiring a bit of work on both ends to represent a rich object as a graph of dumb data structures (and vice versa).</p>

<p>Two examples are <a href=""http://JSON.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)"">JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</a> and <a href=""http://YAML.Org/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)"">YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""http://ASN1.Elibel.Tm.Fr/en/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One)"">ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One)</a> is another data serialization format. Instead of dumbing the format down to a point where it can be easily understood, ASN.1 is self-describing, meaning all the information needed to decode a stream is encoded within the stream itself.</p>

<p>And, of course, <a href=""http://W3.Org/XML/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""XML (eXtensible Markup Language)"">XML (eXtensible Markup Language)</a>, will work too, provided that it is not just used to provide textual representation of a ""memory dump"" of a Java object, but an actual abstract, language-agnostic encoding.</p>

<p>So, to make a long story short: your best bet is to either try to coerce log4j into logging in one of the above-mentioned formats, replace log4j with something that does that or try to somehow intercept the objects before they are sent over the wire and convert them before leaving Javaland.</p>

<p>Libraries that implement JSON, YAML, ASN.1 and XML are available for both Java and Python (and pretty much every programming language known to man).</p>

<p>First, the long array definition in the wsdl:types area:</p>

    &lt;xsd:complexContent mixed=""false""&gt;
      &lt;xsd:restriction base=""soapenc:Array""&gt;

  &lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;

<p>Next, we create a SoapExtensionAttribute that will perform the fix.  It seems that the problem was that .NET wasn't following the multiref id to the element containing the double value.  So, we process the array item, go find the value, and then insert it the value into the element:</p>

<p>Executive summary: You can either change the way .NET deserializes the result set (see Chris's solution above), or you can reconfigure Axis to serialize its results in a way that's compatible with the .NET SOAP implementation.</p>

<p>If you go the latter route, here's how:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... the generated
  classes look and appear to function
  normally, but if you'll look at the
  deserialized array on the client
  (.NET/WCF) side you'll find that the
  array has been deserialized
  incorrectly, and all values in the
  array are 0. You'll have to manually
  look at the SOAP response returned by
  Axis to figure out what's wrong;
  here's a sample response (again,
  edited for clarity):</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv=http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/&gt;

            &lt;doSomethingReturn href=""#id0""/&gt;
            &lt;doSomethingReturn href=""#id1""/&gt;
            &lt;doSomethingReturn href=""#id2""/&gt;
            &lt;doSomethingReturn href=""#id3""/&gt;
            &lt;doSomethingReturn href=""#id4""/&gt;
          &lt;/doSomethingReturn&gt;
        &lt;/doSomethingResponse&gt;
        &lt;multiRef id=""id4""&gt;5&lt;/multiRef&gt;
        &lt;multiRef id=""id3""&gt;4&lt;/multiRef&gt;

        &lt;multiRef id=""id0""&gt;1&lt;/multiRef&gt;
   &lt;/soapenv:Body&gt;
&lt;/soapenv:Envelope&gt;
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>You'll notice that Axis does not
  generate values directly in the
  returned element, but instead
  references external elements for
  values. This might make sense when
  there are many references to
  relatively few discrete values, but
  whatever the case this is not properly
  handled by the WCF basicHttpBinding
  provider (and reportedly by gSOAP and
  classic .NET web references as well).</p>
  
  <p>It took me a while to find a solution:
  edit your Axis deployment's
  server-config.wsdd file and find the
  following parameter:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>&lt;parameter name=""sendMultiRefs"" value=""true""/&gt;

<blockquote>
  <p>Change it to false,
  then redeploy via the command line,
  which looks (under Windows) something
  like this:</p>
</blockquote>

Unfortunately, I don't use this at work, more for side projects and personal projects.  For me, it saves me a lot of time developing new projects for clients.  And, one big reason I use it primarily is, the tight integration with each layer and I never get any lazy load errors that I used to get with Spring (even after the filter and other hacks).</p>

<p>An equivalent Spring application would have much more boilerplate code within it to get stuff working.  Spring does not integrate each layer very well, it more or less is a wrapper for a lot of different things, but doesn't glue itself together very well.</p>

<p>The other nice thing I like with Seam is they practice what they preach.  Take a look at their website.  Take a guess what it is running, hmm, a live example of their code.  Seam Wiki, Seam Forums, etc.  If you truly believe in your code, stand behind it.  I would be happy to have their pager 24x7x365, I bet it rarely goes off.</p>

<p>While you write a lot less code, the learning curve is about twice as steep.  The further I get in, the more I understand how to write good code.  I would like to see more comments, but as far as coding style, it is well written.</p>

<p>On the negative side, just as any product you try to market, Seam was years after Spring had already become popular so Spring is by far still more popular.  Search on Indeed and Seam only has a few hits.  If you look on Spring, there are roughly 40k registered users, while Seam has about 7k.</p>

<p>Depends on what is important to you, as a Java developer/engineer/programmer, you should be able to work with both technologies and chances are, you will most likely encounter a Spring application before a Seam one.  Learn both and how to leverage both.  If you use both properly and know the nuances and quirks of each, development becomes much easier whether you're using Spring or Seam.</p>

<p>I don't agree with the statement, ""Seam is the next Struts"".  Struts was a view technology whereas Seam integrates all layers.  I will agree that it is a new concept like Struts and will bring the same impact to the Java community that Struts did.  I don't think we'll see that until Java EE 6 and CDI become more popular, and of course Seam 3 is released.</p>

You should use these options with care as you are no longer in control of the plugins/dependencies you are using.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you depend on a plugin or a dependency, you can use the a version value of LATEST or RELEASE. LATEST refers to the latest released or snapshot version of a particular artifact, the most recently deployed artifact in a particular repository. RELEASE refers to the last non-snapshot release in the repository. In general, it is not a best practice to design software which depends on a non-specific version of an artifact. If you are developing software, you might want to use RELEASE or LATEST as a convenience so that you don't have to update version numbers when a new release of a third-party library is released. When you release software, you should always make sure that your project depends on specific versions to reduce the chances of your build or your project being affected by a software release not under your control. Use LATEST and RELEASE with caution, if at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See the <a href=""http://www.sonatype.com/books/maven-book/reference/pom-relationships-sect-pom-syntax.html#pom-relationships-sect-latest-release"">POM Syntax section of the Maven book</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Here's an example illustrating the various options. In the Maven repository, com.foo:my-foo has the following metadata:</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;&lt;metadata&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.foo&lt;/groupId&gt;

      &lt;version&gt;1.0.1&lt;/version&gt;

      &lt;version&gt;1.1.1&lt;/version&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;2.0.0&lt;/version&gt;

    &lt;lastUpdated&gt;20090722140000&lt;/lastUpdated&gt;
  &lt;/versioning&gt;
&lt;/metadata&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If a dependency on that artifact is required, you have the following options (other <a href=""http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVEN/Dependency+Mediation+and+Conflict+Resolution#DependencyMediationandConflictResolution-DependencyVersionRanges"">version ranges</a> can be specified of course, just showing the relevant ones here):</p>

<p>Declare an exact version (will always resolve to 1.0.1):</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;version&gt;[1.0.1]&lt;/version&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Declare an explicit version (will always resolve to 1.0.1 unless a collision occurs, when Maven will select a matching version):</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;version&gt;1.0.1&lt;/version&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Declare a version range for all 1.x (will currently resolve to 1.1.1):</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;version&gt;[1.0.0,2.0.0)&lt;/version&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Declare an open-ended version range (will resolve to 2.0.0):</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;version&gt;[1.0.0,)&lt;/version&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Declare the version as LATEST (will resolve to 2.0.0):</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;version&gt;LATEST&lt;/version&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Declare the version as RELEASE (will resolve to 1.1.1):</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;version&gt;RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that by default your own deployments will update the ""latest"" entry in the Maven metadata, but to update the ""release"" entry, you need to activate the ""release-profile"" from the <a href=""http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html"">Maven super POM</a>. You can do this with either ""-Prelease-profile"" or ""-DperformRelease=true""</p>

<hr>

<p>It's worth emphasising that any approach that allows Maven to pick the dependency versions (LATEST, RELEASE, and version ranges) can leave you open to build time issues, as later versions can have different behaviour (for example the dependency plugin has previously switched a default value from true to false, with confusing results).</p>

<p>It is therefore generally a good idea to define exact versions in releases. As <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30571/how-do-i-tell-maven-to-use-the-latest-version-of-a-dependency/1172805#1172805"">Tim's answer</a> points out, the <a href=""http://mojo.codehaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/"">maven-versions-plugin</a> is a handy tool for updating dependency versions, particularly the <a href=""http://mojo.codehaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/use-latest-versions-mojo.html"">versions:use-latest-versions</a> and <a href=""http://mojo.codehaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/use-latest-releases-mojo.html"">versions:use-latest-releases</a> goals.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Versions Plugin has the following goals:
<ul>
<li><strong>versions:display-dependency-updates</strong> scans a project's dependencies and
produces a report of those
dependencies which have newer
versions available.</li>
<li><strong>versions:display-plugin-updates</strong> scans a project's plugins and
produces a report of those plugins
which have newer versions available.</li>
<li><strong>versions:update-parent</strong> updates the parent section of a project so
that it references the newest
available version. For example, if
you use a corporate root POM, this
goal can be helpful if you need to
ensure you are using the latest
version of the corporate root POM.</li>
<li><strong>versions:update-properties</strong> updates properties defined in a
project so that they correspond to
the latest available version of
specific dependencies. This can be
useful if a suite of dependencies
must all be locked to one version.</li>
<li><strong>versions:update-child-modules</strong> updates the parent section of the
child modules of a project so the
version matches the version of the
current project. For example, if you
have an aggregator pom that is also
the parent for the projects that it
aggregates and the children and
parent versions get out of sync, this
mojo can help fix the versions of the
child modules. (Note you may need to
invoke Maven with the -N option in
order to run this goal if your
project is broken so badly that it
cannot build because of the version
mis-match).</li>
<li><strong>versions:lock-snapshots</strong> searches the pom for all -SNAPSHOT
versions and replaces them with the
current timestamp version of that
-SNAPSHOT, e.g. -20090327.172306-4</li>
<li><strong>versions:unlock-snapshots</strong> searches the pom for all timestamp
locked snapshot versions and replaces
them with -SNAPSHOT.</li>
<li><strong>versions:resolve-ranges</strong> finds dependencies using version ranges and
resolves the range to the specific
version being used.</li>
<li><strong>versions:use-releases</strong> searches the pom for all -SNAPSHOT versions
which have been released and replaces
them with the corresponding release
version.</li>
<li><strong>versions:use-next-releases</strong> searches the pom for all non-SNAPSHOT
versions which have been a newer
release and replaces them with the
next release version.</li>
<li><strong>versions:use-latest-releases</strong> searches the pom for all non-SNAPSHOT
versions which have been a newer
release and replaces them with the
latest release version.</li>
<li><strong>versions:use-next-versions</strong> searches the pom for all versions
which have been a newer version and
replaces them with the next version.</li>
<li><strong>versions:use-latest-versions</strong> searches the pom for all versions
which have been a newer version and
replaces them with the latest
version.</li>
<li><strong>versions:commit</strong> removes the pom.xml.versionsBackup files. Forms
one half of the built-in ""Poor Man's
SCM"".</li>
<li><strong>versions:revert</strong> restores the pom.xml files from the
pom.xml.versionsBackup files. Forms
one half of the built-in ""Poor Man's
SCM"".</li>

<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>mvn clean versions:use-latest-versions scm:checkin deploy -Dmessage=""update versions"" -DperformRelease=true
</code></pre>

<p>That is I use the versions plugin and scm plugin to update the dependencies and then check it in to source control. Yes I let my CI do SCM checkins (which you have to do anyway for the maven release plugin).</p>

<p>You'll want to setup the versions plugin to only update what you want:</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>        &lt;plugin&gt;

                &lt;includesList&gt;com.snaphop&lt;/includesList&gt;
                &lt;generateBackupPoms&gt;false&lt;/generateBackupPoms&gt;

<p>I use the release plugin to do the release which takes care of -SNAPSHOT and validates that there is a release version of -SNAPSHOT (which is important).</p>

  <p>Applications may register a new or different handler in the middle of a parse, and the SAX parser must begin using the new handler immediately.</p>

<p>Thus, you should be able to create a <code>SelectorContentHandler</code> that consumes events until the first <code>startElement</code> event, based on that changes the <code>ContentHandler</code> on the XML reader, and passes the first start element event to the new content handler. You just have to pass the <code>XMLReader</code> to the <code>SelectorContentHandler</code> in the constructor.

<p>Yes, I have some bias towards Stax. But as I said, oftentimes data binding is more convenient than streaming solution. But if it's streaming you want, and don't need pipelining (of multiple filtering stages), Stax is simpler than SAX.</p>

<p>One more thing: as good as XOM is (wrt alternatives), often Tree Model is not the right thing to use if  you are not dealing with ""document-centric"" xml  (~= xhtml pages, docbook, open office docs).
For data interchange, config files etc data binding is more convenient, more efficient, more natural. Just say no to tree models like DOM for these use cases.
So, JAXB, XStream, JibX are good. Or, for more acquired taste, digester, castor, xmlbeans.</p>

<p>The code you are running is actually a JET query purely within Access - the Java code is doing nothing except telling Access to run the query.</p>

<p>On the one hand, if it ain't broke don't fix it. On the other hand, there's a good chance it will break in the near future so you could try fixing it in advance.</p>

<p>The two likely reasons it might break are:</p>

<ol>
<li>SQL injection risk. Depending on where csvDirPath and csvFileName come from (e.g. csvFileName might come from the name of the file uploaded by a user?), and on how clever the Access JDBC driver is, you could be open to someone breaking or deleting your data by inserting a semicolon (or some brackets to make a subquery) and some additional SQL commands into the query.</li>
<li>You are relying on the columns of the CSV file being compatible with the columns of the Access table. If you have unchecked CSV being uploaded, or if the CSV generator has a particular way of handling nulls, or if you one day get an unusual date or number format, you may get an error on inserting into the Access table.</li>
</ol>

<p>Having said all that, we are all about pragmatism here. If the above code is from a utility class which you are going to use by hand a few times a week/month/year/ever, then it isn't really a problem.</p>

<p>If it is a class which forms part of a web application, then the 'official' Java way to do it would be to read records out of the CSV file (either using a CSV parser or a CSV/text JDBC driver), get the columns out of the recordset, do some validation or sanity checking on them, and then use a new PreparedStatement to insert them into the Access database. Much more trouble but much more robust.</p>

<p>You can probably find a combination of tools (e.g. object-relational layers or other data access tools) which will do a lot of that for you, but setting up the tools is going to be as much hassle as writing the code. Then again, you'll learn a lot from either one.</p>

<p>There are exceptions, though. One place you see buffers (output this time) is in the servlet API. Data isn't written to the underlying stream until <em>flush()</em> is called, allowing you to buffer output but then dump the buffer if an error occurs and write an error page instead. You might buffer input if you needed to reset the stream for rereading using <em>mark(int)</em> and <em>reset()</em>. For example, maybe you'd inspect the file header before deciding on which content handler to pass the stream to.</p>

<p>Unrelated, but I think you should rewrite your stream handling. This pattern works best to avoid resource leaks:</p>

<pre><code>    InputStream stream = new FileInputStream(""in"");
    try { //no operations between open stream and try block
        //work
    } finally { //do nothing but close this one stream in the finally

Instead, the word “templates” is used and is more accurate. Templates describes one <em>technique</em> to achieve a generic design.</p>

<p>C++ templates is very different from what both C# and Java implement for two main reasons. The first reason is that C++ templates don't only allow compile-time type arguments but also compile-time const-value arguments: templates can be given as integers or even function signatures. This means that you can do some quite funky stuff at compile time, e.g. calculations:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;unsigned int N&gt;
struct product {
    static unsigned int const VALUE = N * product&lt;N - 1&gt;::VALUE;
};

template &lt;&gt;
struct product&lt;1&gt; {
    static unsigned int const VALUE = 1;
};

// Usage:
unsigned int const p5 = product&lt;5&gt;::VALUE;
</code></pre>

<p>This code also uses the other distinguished feature of C++ templates, namely template specialization. The code defines one class template, <code>product</code> that has one value argument. It also defines a specialization for that template that is used whenever the argument evaluates to 1. This allows me to define a recursion over template definitions. I believe that this was first discovered by <a href=""http://erdani.org/"">Andrei Alexandrescu</a>.</p>

<p>Template specialization is important for C++ because it allows for structural differences in data structures. Templates as a whole is a means of unifying an interface across types. However, although this is desirable, all types cannot be treated equally inside the implementation. C++ templates takes this into account. This is very much the same difference that OOP makes between interface and implementation with the overriding of virtual methods.</p>

<p>C++ templates are essential for its algorithmic programming paradigm. For example, almost all algorithms for containers are defined as functions that accept the container type as a template type and treat them uniformly. Actually, that's not quite right: C++ doesn't work on containers but rather on <em>ranges</em> that are defined by two iterators, pointing to the beginning and behind the end of the container. Thus, the whole content is circumscribed by the iterators: begin &lt;= elements &lt; end.</p>

<p>Using iterators instead of containers is useful because it allows to operate on parts of a container instead of on the whole.</p>

<p>Another distinguishing feature of C++ is the possibility of <em>partial specialization</em> for class templates. This is somewhat related to pattern matching on arguments in Haskell and other functional languages. For example, let's consider a class that stores elements:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;
class Store { … }; // (1)
</code></pre>

<p>This works for any element type. But let's say that we can store pointers more effciently than other types by applying some special trick. We can do this by <em>partially</em> specializing for all pointer types:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;
class Store&lt;T*&gt; { … }; // (2)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, whenever we instance a container template for one type, the appropriate definition is used:</p>

<pre><code>Store&lt;int&gt; x; // Uses (1)
Store&lt;int*&gt; y; // Uses (2)
Store&lt;string**&gt; z; // Uses (2), with T = string*.

<p>Templates are one of the main reasons why C++ fails so abysmally at intellisense, regardless of the IDE used. Because of template specialization, the IDE can never be really sure if a given member exists or not. Consider:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;
struct X {
    void foo() { }
};

template &lt;&gt;
struct X&lt;int&gt; { };

typedef int my_int_type;

X&lt;my_int_type&gt; a;
a.|
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the cursor is at the indicated position and it's damn hard for the IDE to say at that point if, and what, members <code>a</code> has. For other languages the parsing would be straightforward but for C++, quite a bit of evaluation is needed beforehand.</p>

<p>It gets worse. What if <code>my_int_type</code> were defined inside a class template as well? Now its type would depend on another type argument. And here, even compilers fail.</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;
struct Y {
    typedef T my_type;
};

X&lt;Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type&gt; b;
</code></pre>

<p>After a bit of thinking, a programmer would conclude that this code is the same as the above: <code>Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type</code> resolves to <code>int</code>, therefore <code>b</code> should be the same type as <code>a</code>, right?</p>

<p>Wrong. At the point where the compiler tries to resolve this statement, it doesn't actually know <code>Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type</code> yet! Therefore, it doesn't know that this is a type. It could be something else, e.g. a member function or a field. This might give rise to ambiguities (though not in the present case), therefore the compiler fails. We have to tell it explicitly that we refer to a type name:</p>

<pre><code>X&lt;typename Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type&gt; b;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the code compiles. To see how ambiguities arise from this situation, consider the following code:</p>

<pre><code>Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type(123);
</code></pre>

<p>This code statement is perfectly valid and tells C++ to execute the function call to <code>Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type</code>. However, if <code>my_type</code> is not a function but rather a type, this statement would still be valid and perform a special cast (the function-style cast) which is often a constructor invocation. The compiler can't tell which we mean so we have to disambiguate here.</p>

<p>For example, in Java the existing <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/collections/index.html"">Collections Framework</a> was <em>completely genericised</em>.  <strong>Java does not have both a generic and legacy non-generic version of the collections classes.</strong>  In some ways this is much cleaner - if you need to use a collection in C# there is really very little reason to go with the non-generic version, but those legacy classes remain in place, cluttering up the landscape. </p>

<h2>C# Generics allow you to declare something like this.</h2>

<pre><code>List&lt;Person&gt; foo = new List&lt;Person&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>and then the compiler will prevent you from putting things that aren't <code>Person</code> into the list.<br>
Behind the scenes the C# compiler is just putting <code>List&lt;Person&gt;</code> into the .NET dll file, but at runtime the JIT compiler  goes and builds a new set of code, as if you had written a special list class just for containing people - something like <code>ListOfPerson</code>.</p>

<p>The benefit of this is that it makes it really fast. There's no casting or any other stuff, and because the dll contains the information that this is a List of <code>Person</code>, other code that looks at it later on using reflection can tell that it contains <code>Person</code> objects (so you get intellisense and so on).</p>

<p>The downside of this is that old C# 1.0 and 1.1 code (before they added generics) doesn't understand these new <code>List&lt;something&gt;</code>, so you have to manually convert things back to plain old <code>List</code> to interoperate with them. This is not that big of a problem, because C# 2.0 binary code is not backwards compatible. The only time this will ever happen is if you're upgrading some old C# 1.0/1.1 code to C# 2.0</p>

<h2>Java Generics allow you to declare something like this.</h2>

<pre><code>ArrayList&lt;Person&gt; foo = new ArrayList&lt;Person&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>On the surface it looks the same, and it sort-of is. The compiler will also prevent you from putting things that aren't <code>Person</code> into the list.</p>

<p>The difference is what happens behind the scenes. Unlike C#, Java does not go and build a special <code>ListOfPerson</code> - it just uses the plain old <code>ArrayList</code> which has always been in Java. When you get things out of the array, the usual <code>Person p = (Person)foo.get(1);</code> casting-dance still has to be done. The compiler is saving you the key-presses, but the speed hit/casting is still incurred just like it always was.<br>
When people mention ""Type Erasure"" this is what they're talking about. The compiler inserts the casts for you, and then 'erases' the fact that it's meant to be a list of <code>Person</code> not just <code>Object</code></p>

<p>The benefit of this approach is that old code which doesn't understand generics doesn't have to care. It's still dealing with the same old <code>ArrayList</code> as it always has. This is more important in the java world because they wanted to support compiling code using Java 5 with generics, and having it run on old 1.4 or previous JVM's, which microsoft deliberately decided not to bother with.</p>

<p>The downside is the speed hit I mentioned previously, and also because there is no <code>ListOfPerson</code> pseudo-class or anything like that going into the .class files, code that looks at it later on (with reflection, or if you pull it out of another collection where it's been converted into <code>Object</code> or so on) can't tell in any way that it's meant to be a list containing only <code>Person</code> and not just any other array list.</p>

<h2>C++ Templates allow you to declare something like this</h2>

<pre><code>std::list&lt;Person&gt;* foo = new std::list&lt;Person&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like C# and Java generics, and it will do what you think it should do, but behind the scenes different things are happening.</p>

<p>It has the most in common with C# generics in that it builds special <code>pseudo-classes</code> rather than just throwing the type information away like java does, but it's a whole different kettle of fish.</p>

<p>Both C# and Java produce output which is designed for virtual machines. If you write some code which has a <code>Person</code> class in it, in both cases some information about a <code>Person</code> class will go into the .dll or .class file, and the JVM/CLR will do stuff with this.</p>

<p>C++ produces raw x86 binary code. Everything is <em>not</em> an object, and there's no underlying virtual machine which needs to know about a <code>Person</code> class. There's no boxing or unboxing, and functions don't have to belong to classes, or indeed anything. </p>

<p>Because of this, the C++ compiler places no restrictions on what you can do with templates - basically any code you could write manually, you can get templates to write for you.<br>
The most obvious example is adding things:</p>

<p>In C# and Java, the generics system needs to know what methods are available for a class, and it needs to pass this down to the virtual machine. The only way to tell it this is by either hard-coding the actual class in, or using interfaces. For example:</p>

<pre><code>int addNames&lt;T&gt;( T first, T second ) { return first.Name() + second.Name(); }
</code></pre>

<p>That code won't compile in C# or Java, because it doesn't know that the type <code>T</code> actually provides a method called Name(). You have to tell it - in C# like this:</p>

<pre><code>interface IHasName{ string Name(); };
int addNames&lt;T&gt;( T first, T second ) where T : IHasName { .... }
</code></pre>

<p>And then you have to make sure the things you pass to addNames implement the IHasName interface and so on. The java syntax is different (<code>&lt;T extends IHasName&gt;</code>), but it suffers from the same problems.</p>

<p>The 'classic' case for this problem is trying to write a function which does this</p>

<pre><code>int addNames&lt;T&gt;( T first, T second ) { return first + second; }
</code></pre>

<p>You can't actually write this code because there are no ways to declare an interface with the <code>+</code> method in it. You fail.</p>

<p>C++ suffers from none of these problems. The compiler doesn't care about passing types down to any VM's - if both your objects have a .Name() function, it will compile. If they don't, it won't. Simple.</p>

<p>So, there you have it :-)</p>

<p>As was already explained, the main difference is <em>type erasure</em>, i.e. the fact that the Java compiler erases the generic types and they don't end up in the generated bytecode. However, the question is: why would anyone do that? It doesn't make sense! Or does it?</p>

<p>Well, what's the alternative? If you don't implement generics in the language, where <em>do</em> you implement them? And the answer is: in the Virtual Machine. Which breaks backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>Type erasure, on the other hand, allows you to mix generic clients with non-generic libraries. In other words: code that was compiled on Java 5 can still be deployed to Java 1.4.</p>

<p>Microsoft, however, decided to break backwards compatibility for generics. <em>That's</em> why .NET Generics are ""better"" than Java Generics.</p>

<p>Of course, Sun aren't idiots or cowards. The reason why they ""chickened out"", was that Java was significantly older and more widespread than .NET when they introduced generics. (They were introduced roughly at the same time in both worlds.) Breaking backwards compatibility would have been a huge pain.</p>

<p>Put yet another way: in Java, Generics are a part of the <em>Language</em> (which means they apply <em>only</em> to Java, not to other languages), in .NET they are part of the <em>Virtual Machine</em> (which means they apply to <em>all</em> languages, not just C# and Visual Basic.NET).</p>

<p>Compare this with .NET features like LINQ, lambda expressions, local variable type inference, anonymous types and expression trees: these are all <em>language</em> features. That's why there are subtle differences between VB.NET and C#: if those features were part of the VM, they would be the same in <em>all</em> languages. But the CLR hasn't changed: it's still the same in .NET 3.5 SP1 as it was in .NET 2.0. You can compile a C# program that uses LINQ with the .NET 3.5 compiler and still run it on .NET 2.0, provided that you don't use any .NET 3.5 libraries. That would <em>not</em> work with generics and .NET 1.1, but it <em>would</em> work with Java and Java 1.4.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>And suppose you don't need to refer to the type T in the method body. You're declaring a name T and then only using it once, so why should you have to think of a name for it? Instead, you can write:</p>

<p>Contrary to popular believe, which I never understand where it came from, .net implemented true generics without breaking backward compatibility, and they spent explicit effort for that.
You don't have to change your non-generic .net 1.0 code into generics just to be used in .net 2.0. Both the generic and non-generic lists are still available in .Net framework 2.0 even until 4.0, exactly for nothing else but backward compatibility reason. Therefore old codes that still used non-generic ArrayList will still work, and use the same ArrayList class as before.
Backward code compatibility is always maintained since 1.0 till now... So even in .net 4.0, you still have to option to use any non-generics class from 1.0 BCL if you choose to do so.</p>

  Do you see yourself wanting to frequently switch the format of your logging output? Will you need an easy, flexible way to do so? In other words, do you need Log4j's PatternLayout?</p>
  
  <p>Question Three :
  Do you anticipate a definite need for the ability to change complex logging configurations in your applications, after they are compiled and deployed in a production environment? Does your configuration sound something like, ""Severe messages from this class get sent via e-mail to the support guy; severe messages from a subset of classes get logged to a syslog deamon on our server; warning messages from another subset of classes get logged to a file on network drive A; and then all messages from everywhere get logged to a file on network drive B""? And do you see yourself tweaking it every couple of days?</p>
  
  <p>If you can answer yes to any of the above questions, go with Log4j. If you answer a definite no to all of them, JUL will be more than adequate and it's conveniently already included in the SDK.</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>Embrace <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller"" rel=""nofollow"">MVC</a> you need not only to know what this means but use it extensively.</p>

<p>There are two main patterns for associating controllers with the views</p>

<h3>Dot Net Style, One Request controller per view</h3>

<p>Every top level page has a request scoped controller (bean) all validation and actions of the page use this class. Also used for filtering and ordering the Model.
The Model will be stored on a few session level controllers which will handle talking to the back-end (EJBs, or persistence layer) these session controllers should be implementing the business logic and have no knowledge of JSF,HTML or any presentation technology.</p>

<h3>Controllers are session level</h3>

<p>Design controllers based on your data model, nest them with in each other. (This post is getting too long so I wont go into the nuts and bolts of these).</p>

<p>But here is another solution to your problem:
In my mind, there are two statements that collide with each other here: ""debug statements"" and ""production code"". </p>

<p>What is the purpose of debug statements? Help to get rid of bugs while (unit) testing. If a piece of software is properly tested and works according to the requirements, debug statements are nothing else but OBSOLETE.</p>

<p>I strongly disagree with leaving any debug statements in production code. I bet nobody bothers testing side-effects of debug code in production code. The code probably does what it's supposed to do, but does it do more than that? Do all your #defines work correctly and really take ALL of the debug code out? Who analyzes 100000 lines of pre-processed code to see if all the debug stuff is gone?</p>

<p>Unless we have a different definition of production code, you should consider taking out the debug statements after the code is tested and be done with it.</p>

<p><strong>First:</strong>
for real logging, use a modern logging package like log4j or java's own built in logging. Don't worry about performance so much, the logging level check is on the order of nanoseconds. (it's an integer comparison).</p>

<p>And if you have more than a single log statement, guard the whole block:</p>

<p>(log4j, for example:)</p>

<pre><code>if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {

  // perform expensive operations
  // build string to log

  logger.debug(""...."");
}
</code></pre>

<p>This gives you the added ability control logging at runtime. Having to restart and run a debug build can be very inconvenient.</p>

<p><strong>Second:</strong></p>

<p>You may find <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/lang/assert.html"">assertions</a> are more what you need. An assertion is a statement which evaluates to a boolean result, with an optional message:</p>

<pre><code> assert (sky.state != FALLING) : ""The sky is falling!"";
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever the assertion results in a false, the assertion fails and an AssertionError is thrown containing your message (this is an unchecked exception, intended to exit the application). </p>

<p>The neat thing is, these are treated special by the JVM and can toggled at runtime down to the class level, using a VM parameter (no recompile needed). If not enabled, there is zero overhead.</p>

<li>Exceptions have the advantage of safety, as the check is always performed.  </li>

<p>The choice really depends on the development practices of the project.  The project as a whole needs to decide on an assertion policy: if the choice is to enable assertions during all development, then I'd say to use assertions to check this kind of invalid parameter - in a production system, a NullPointerException thrown due to a programming error is unlikely to be able to be caught and handled in a meaningful way anyway and so will act just like an assertion.</p>

<p>Practically though, I know a lot of developers that don't trust that assertions will be enabled when appropriate and so opt for the safety of throwing a NullPointerException.</p>

<p>Of course if you can't enforce a policy for your code (if you're creating a library, for example, and so are dependent on how other developers run your code), you should opt for the safe approach of throwing NullPointerException for those methods that are part of the library's API.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>When setting cookies in your app, use</p>

<pre><code>response.setHeader( ""Set-Cookie"", ""name=value; HttpOnly"");
</code></pre>

<p>However, in many webapps, the most important cookie is the session identifier, which is automatically set by the container as the JSESSIONID cookie.</p>

<p>If you only use this cookie, you can write a ServletFilter to re-set the cookies on the way out, forcing JSESSIONID to HttpOnly. The page at <strike>http://keepitlocked.net/archive/2007/11/05/java-and-httponly.aspx</strike> <a href=""http://alexsmolen.com/blog/?p=16"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alexsmolen.com/blog/?p=16</a> suggests adding the following in a filter.</p>

<pre><code>if (response.containsHeader( ""SET-COOKIE"" )) {
  String sessionid = request.getSession().getId();
  response.setHeader( ""SET-COOKIE"", ""JSESSIONID="" + sessionid 
                      + "";Path=/&lt;whatever&gt;; Secure; HttpOnly"" );
} 
</code></pre>

<p>but note that this will overwrite all cookies and only set what you state here in this filter. </p>

<p>If you use additional cookies to the JSESSIONID cookie, then you'll need to extend this code to set all the cookies in the filter. This is not a great solution in the case of multiple-cookies, but is a perhaps an acceptable quick-fix for the JSESSIONID-only setup. </p>

<p>Please note that as your code evolves over time, there's a nasty hidden bug waiting for you when you forget about this filter and try and set another cookie somewhere else in your code. Of course, it won't get set.</p>

<p>This really is a hack though. If you do use Tomcat and can compile it, then take a look at Shabaz's excellent suggestion to patch HttpOnly support into Tomcat.</p>

<p>The steps are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Restore View</strong>. The UIComponent tree is rebuilt.</li>
<li><strong>Apply Request Values</strong>. Editable components should implement EditableValueHolder. This phase walks the component tree and calls the <em>processDecodes</em> methods. If the component isn't something complex like a UIData, it won't do much except call its own <em>decode</em> method. The <em>decode</em> method doesn't do much except find its renderer and invokes its <em>decode</em> method, passing itself as an argument. It is the renderer's job to get any submitted value and set it via <em>setSubmittedValue</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Process Validations</strong>. This phase calls <em>processValidators</em> which will call <em>validate</em>. The <em>validate</em> method takes the submitted value, converts it with any converters, validates it with any validators and (assuming the data passes those tests) calls <em>setValue</em>. This will store the value as a local variable. While this local variable is not null, it will be returned and not the value from the value binding for any calls to <em>getValue</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Update Model Values</strong>. This phase calls <em>processUpdates</em>. In an input component, this will call <em>updateModel</em> which will get the <em>ValueExpression</em> and invoke it to set the value on the model.</li>
<li><strong>Invoke Application</strong>. Button event listeners and so on will be invoked here (as will navigation if memory serves).</li>
<li><strong>Render Response</strong>. The tree is rendered via the renderers and the state saved.</li>
<li>If any of these phases fail (e.g. a value is invalid), the lifecycle skips to Render Response.</li>
<li>Various events can be fired after most of these phases, invoking listeners as appropriate (like value change listeners after Process Validations).</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a somewhat simplified version of events. Refer to the specification for more details.</p>

<p>I would question why you are writing your own UIComponent. This is a non-trivial task and a deep understanding of the JSF architecture is required to get it right.

<p>Some of the design decisions behind JSF start to make a little more sense when you consider the goals. JSF was designed to be tooled - it exposes lots of metadata for IDEs.

<p>Of that, I think the only part that I agree with is the ""a little more sense"".  The metadata could have been exposed in other ways in JSF 1.2, and frankly, I have yet to see an IDE make decent use of it.  Why can't an IDE give me a simple way to build a component?</p>

<p>1) It encourages you to think about the failure modes for the code you write. Basically, you have to consider the exceptions that the code you call may throw, and in turn you'll consider the exceptions you'll throw for the code that calls yours.</p>

<p>2) It gives you the opportunity to add additional debugging information into the exception chain. For instance, if you have a method that throws an exception on a duplicate username, you might wrap that exception with one that includes additional information about the circumstances of the failure (for example, the IP of the request that provided the dupe username) that wasn't available to the lower-level code. The cookie trail of exceptions may help you debug a complex problem (it certainly has for me).</p>

<p>3) It lets you become implementation-independent from the lower level code. If you're wrapping exceptions and need to swap out Hibernate for some other ORM, you only have to change your Hibernate-handling code. All the other layers of code will still be successfully using the wrapped exceptions and will interpret them in the same way, even though the underlying circumstances have changed. Note that this applies even if Hibernate changes in some way (ex: they switch exceptions in a new version); it's not just for wholesale technology replacement.</p>

<p>4) It encourages you use different classes of exceptions to represent different situations. For example, you may have a DuplicateUsernameException when the user tries to reuse a username, and a DatabaseFailureException when you can't check for dupe usernames due to a broken DB connection. This, in turn, lets you answer your question (""how do I recover?"") in flexible and powerful ways. If you get a DuplicateUsernameException, you may decide to suggest a different username to the user. If you get a DatabaseFailureException, you may let it bubble up to the point where it displays a ""down for maintenance"" page to the user and send off a notification email to you. Once you have custom exceptions, you have customizeable responses -- and that's a good thing.</p>

Management of Errors</a></p>

<p>From the Split Domain and Technical Errors pattern</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A technical error should never cause a
  domain error to be generated (never
  the twain should meet). When a
  technical error must cause business
  processing to fail, it should be
  wrapped as a SystemError. </p>
  
  <p>Domain errors should always start from a
  domain problem and be handled by
  domain code. </p>
  
  <p>Domain errors should
  pass ""seamlessly"" through technical
  boundaries. It may be that such errors
  must be serialized and re-constituted
  for this to happen. Proxies and
  facades should take responsibility for
  doing this. </p>
  
  <p>Technical errors should
  be handled in particular points in the
  application, such as boundaries (see
  Log at Distribution Boundary). </p>
  
  <p>The
  amount of context information passed
  back with the error will depend on how
  useful this will be for subsequent
  diagnosis and handling (figuring out
  an alternative strategy). You need to
  question whether the stack trace from
  a remote machine is wholly useful to
  the processing of a domain error
  (although the code location of the
  error and variable values at that time
  may be useful)</p>
</blockquote>

There, I'd create a populate a <code>Filter</code> with a <code>FilteredQuery</code> wrapping the original <code>Query</code>. Then I'd get a <code>FieldCache</code> for the field of interest. Enumerate the hits in the filter's bitset, and for each hit, you get the value of the field from the field cache, and add it to a SortedSet. When you've got all of the hits, divide the size of the set into the number of ranges you want (five to seven is a good number according the user interface guys), and rather than a single-valued constraint, your facets will be a range query with the lower and upper bounds of each of those subsets.</p>

<p>I'd recommend using some special-case logic for a small number of values; obviously, if you only have four distinct values, it doesn't make sense to try and make 5 range refinements out of them. Below a certain threshold (say 3*your ideal number of ranges), you just show the facets normally rather than ranges.</p>

The solution involves some pre-processing of documents and some post-processing of the query results, but it requires only one query to Solr, and should even work on old version of Solr like 1.4.</p>

<h1>Round up prices before submission</h1>

<p>First, before submitting the document, <strong>round up</strong> the the price to the nearest ""nice round facet boundary"" and store it in a ""rounded_price"" field.  Users like their facets to look like ""250-500"" not ""247-483"", and rounding also means you get back hundreds of price facets not millions of them.  With some effort the following code can be generalised to round nicely at any price scale:</p>

<pre><code>    public static decimal RoundPrice(decimal price)
    {
        if (price &lt; 25)
            return Math.Ceiling(price);
        else if (price &lt; 100)
            return Math.Ceiling(price / 5) * 5;
        else if (price &lt; 250)
            return Math.Ceiling(price / 10) * 10;
        else if (price &lt; 1000)
            return Math.Ceiling(price / 25) * 25;
        else if (price &lt; 2500)
            return Math.Ceiling(price / 100) * 100;
        else if (price &lt; 10000)
            return Math.Ceiling(price / 250) * 250;
        else if (price &lt; 25000)
            return Math.Ceiling(price / 1000) * 1000;
        else if (price &lt; 100000)
            return Math.Ceiling(price / 2500) * 2500;
        else
            return Math.Ceiling(price / 5000) * 5000;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Permissible prices go 1,2,3,...,24,25,30,35,...,95,100,110,...,240,250,275,300,325,...,975,1000 and so forth.  </p>

<h1>Get all facets on rounded prices</h1>

<p>Second, when submitting the query, request all facets on rounded prices sorted by price: <code>facet.field=rounded_price</code>.  Thanks to the rounding, you'll get at most a few hundred facets back.</p>

<h1>Combine adjacent facets into larger facets</h1>

<p>Third, after you have the results, the user wants see only 3 to 7 facets, not hundreds of facets.  So, combine adjacent facets into a few large facets (called ""segments"") trying to get a roughly equal number of documents in each segment. The following rather more complicated code does this, returning tuples of (start, end, count) suitable for performing range queries.  The counts returned will be correct provided prices were been rounded <em>up</em> to the nearest boundary:</p>

<pre><code>    public static List&lt;Tuple&lt;string, string, int&gt;&gt; CombinePriceFacets(int nSegments, ICollection&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;string, int&gt;&gt; prices)
    {
        var ranges = new List&lt;Tuple&lt;string, string, int&gt;&gt;();
        int productCount = prices.Sum(p =&gt; p.Value);
        int productsRemaining = productCount;
        if (nSegments &lt; 2)
            return ranges;
        int segmentSize = productCount / nSegments;
        string start = ""*"";
        string end = ""0"";
        int count = 0;
        int totalCount = 0;
        int segmentIdx = 1;
        foreach (KeyValuePair&lt;string, int&gt; price in prices)
        {
            end = price.Key;
            count += price.Value;
            totalCount += price.Value;
            productsRemaining -= price.Value;
            if (totalCount &gt;= segmentSize * segmentIdx)
            {
                ranges.Add(new Tuple&lt;string, string, int&gt;(start, end, count));
                start = end;
                count = 0;
                segmentIdx += 1;
            }
            if (segmentIdx == nSegments)
            {
                ranges.Add(new Tuple&lt;string, string, int&gt;(start, ""*"", count + productsRemaining));
                break;
            }
        }
        return ranges;
    }
</code></pre>

<h1>Filter results by selected facet</h1> 

<p>Fourth, suppose (""250"",""500"",38) was one of the resulting segments.  If the user selects ""$250 to $500"" as a filter, simply do a filter query <code>fq=price:[250 TO 500]</code></p>

However, if you're looking for an alternative to using reflection, and have access to the source you're testing, this will still be an option.</p>

<p>There is possible merit in testing private methods of a class, particularly with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"">test driven development</a>, where you would like to design small tests before you write any code. </p>

<p>Creating a test with access to private members and methods can test areas of code which are difficult to target specifically with access only to public methods. If a public method has several steps involved, it can consist of several private methods, which can then be tested individually. </p>

<p>Advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>can test to a finer granularity</li>
</ul>

<p>Disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>test code must reside in the same
file as source code, which can be
more difficult to maintain</li>
<li>similarly with .class output files, they must remain within the same package as declared in source code</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if continuous testing requires this method, it may be a signal that the private methods should be extracted, which could be tested in the traditional, public way.</p>

<p>Here is a convoluted example of how this would work:</p>

<pre><code>// import statements and package declarations

public class ClassToTest 
{
    private int decrement(int toDecrement) {
    	toDecrement--;
    	return toDecrement;
    }

    // constructor and rest of class

    public static class StaticInnerTest extends TestCase
    {
    	public StaticInnerTest(){
    		super();
    	}

    	public void testDecrement(){
    		int number = 10;
    		ClassToTest toTest= new ClassToTest();
    		int decremented = toTest.decrement(number);
    		assertEquals(9, decremented);
    	}

    	public static void main(String[] args) {
    		junit.textui.TestRunner.run(StaticInnerTest.class);
    	}

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Inner class would be compiled to <code>ClassToTest$StaticInnerTest</code>.</p>

What you <em>should</em> be testing is the public contract that the class has with other objects; you should never directly test an object's internals. If another developer wants to make a small internal change to the class, which doesn't affect the classes public contract, he/she then has to modify your reflection based test to ensure that it works. If you do this repeatedly throughout a project unit tests and then stop being a useful measurement of code health, and start to become a hindrance to development, and an annoyance to the development team.</p>

<p>What I recommend doing instead is using a code coverage tool such as Cobertura, to ensure that the unit tests you write provide decent coverage of the code in private methods. That way, you indirectly test what the private methods are doing, and maintain a higher level of agility.</p>

This of course assumes that the public <code>doIt</code> method is only called by a single thread.</p>

<p>Another option is to refactor the public method to call a private helper method.  The private method takes the list as a parameter and returns the count.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;Thing&gt; doIt(String aString) {
    List&lt;Thing&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Thing&gt;();
    int count = doItHelper(aString, list, 0);

private int doItHelper(String aString, List&lt;Thing&gt; list, int count) {
    // ...
    // do something that updates count
    count = doItHelper(aString, list, count);
    // ...
    return count;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes that you can do the error handling in the public <code>doIt</code> method, since the <code>count</code> variable isn't actually passed back to the caller.  If you need to do that, you could of course throw an exception:</p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;Thing&gt; doIt(String aString) throws SomeCustomException {
    List&lt;Thing&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Thing&gt;();
    int count = doItHelper(aString, list, 0);
    // ...
    if (someErrorOccurred) {
        throw new SomeCustomException(""Error occurred at chracter index "" + count, count);

<p>There are few catches:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>tool.jar</code> is a library distributed with Oracle JDK but not JRE! </li>
<li>You cannot get <code>tool.jar</code> from Maven repo; configure it with Maven is a bit tricky</li>
<li>The <code>tool.jar</code> probably contains platform dependent (native?) code so it is not easily 
 distributable</li>
<li>It runs under assumption that all (local) running JVM apps are ""monitorable"". It looks like
 that from Java 6 all apps generally are (unless you actively configure opposite)</li>
<li>It probably works only for Java 6+</li>
<li>Eclipse does not publish main class, so you will not get Eclipse PID easily
Bug in MonitoredVmUtil?</li>
</ul>

<p>UPDATE: I have just double checked that JPS uses this way, that is Jvmstat library (part of tool.jar). So there is no need to call JPS as external process, call Jvmstat library directly as my example shows. You can aslo get list of all JVMs runnin on localhost this way.

<p>Another tip: You can boost download times even more if you increase the size of the TCP Window on the client's NIC configuration.  Set it as high as the OS allows and you should see up to 2x improvement depending on your physical network.  This worked for me on Windows 2000 and 2003 when FTPing over a WAN.  The down side is it may increase overhead for all other network traffic that wants only a few KB for a network packet, but is now forced to send/recv in 64KB packets.  Your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>Basically in C++ templates are basically a glorified preprocessor/macro set (<strong>Note:</strong> since some people seem unable to comprehend an analogy, I'm not saying template processing is a macro).  In Java they are basically syntactic sugar to minimize boilerplate casting of Objects.  Here is a pretty decent <a href=""http://www.mindview.net/WebLog/log-0061"">introduction to C++ templates vs Java generics</a>.</p>

<p>To elaborate on this point: when you use a C++ template, you're basically creating another copy of the code, just as if you used a <code>#define</code> macro.  This allows you to do things like have <code>int</code> parameters in template definitions that determine sizes of arrays and such.</p>

<p>Java doesn't work like that.  In Java all objects extent from <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html"">java.lang.Object</a> so, pre-Generics, you'd write code like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class PhoneNumbers {
  private Map phoneNumbers = new HashMap();

  public String getPhoneNumber(String name) {
    return (String)phoneNumbers.get(name);
  }

  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>because all the Java collection types used Object as their base type so you could put anything in them.  Java 5 rolls around and adds generics so you can do things like:</p>

<pre><code>public class PhoneNumbers {
  private Map&lt;String, String&gt; phoneNumbers = new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;();

  public String getPhoneNumber(String name) {
    return phoneNumbers.get(name);
  }

  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>And that's all Java Generics are: wrappers for casting objects.  That's because Java Generics aren't reified.  They use type erasure.  This decision was made because Java Generics came along so late in the piece that they didn't want to break backward compatibility (a <code>Map&lt;String, String&gt;</code> is usable whenever a <code>Map</code> is called for).  Compare this to .Net/C# where type erasure isn't used, which leads to all sorts of differences (eg you can use primitive types and <code>IEnumerable</code> and <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> bear no relation to each other).</p>

<p>And a class using generics compiled with a Java 5+ compiler is usable no JDK 1.4 (assuming it doesn't use any ohter features or classes that require Java 5+).</p>

<p>That's why Java Generics are called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar"">syntactic sugar</a>.</p>

<p>But this decision on how to do generics has profound effects so much so that the (superb) <a href=""http://www.angelikalanger.com/GenericsFAQ/JavaGenericsFAQ.html"">Java Generics FAQ</a> has sprung up to answer the many, many questions people have about Java Generics.</p>

<p>C++ templates have a number of features that Java Generics don't:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use of primitive type arguments.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;class T, int i&gt;
class Matrix {
  int T[i][i];
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Use of <a href=""http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc/language/ref/default_args_for_templ_params.htm"">default type arguments</a>, which is one feature I miss in Java but there are backwards compatibility reasons for this;</li>
<li>C++ allows the use of primitive type arguments, Java doesn't; and</li>
<li>Java allows bounding of arguments.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>public class ObservableList&lt;T extends List&gt; {
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>It really does need to be stressed that template invocations with different arguments really are different types.  They don't even share static members.  In Java this is not the case.</p>

<p>Aside from the differences with generics, for completeness, here is a <a href=""http://www.javacoffeebreak.com/articles/thinkinginjava/comparingc++andjava.html"">basic comparison of C++ and Java</a> (and <a href=""http://triton.towson.edu/~mzimand/os/Lect2-java-tutorial.html"">another one</a>).</p>

<p>And I can also suggest <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0131872486"">Thinking in Java</a>.  As a C++ programmer a lot of the concepts like objects will be second nature already but there are subtle differences so it can be worthwhile to have an introductory text even if you skim parts.</p>

<p>A lot of what you'll learn when laerning Java is all the libraries (both standard--what comes in the JDK--and nonstandard, which includes commonly used things like Spring).  Java syntax is more verbose than C++ syntax and doesn't have a lot of C++ features (eg operator overloading, mutliple inheritance, the destructor mechanism, etc) but that doesn't strictly make it a subset of C++ either.</p>

<p>Watch out for mutability issues...</p>

<p>It may seem sensible to omit getters/setters. It actually may be ok in some cases. The real problem with the proposed pattern shown here is mutability.</p>

<p>The problem is once you pass an object reference out containing non-final, public fields. Anything else with that reference is free to modify those fields. You no longer have any control over the state of that object. (Think what would happen if Strings were mutable.)</p>

<p>It gets bad when that object is an important part of the internal state of another, you've just exposed internal implementation. To prevent this, a copy of the object must be returned instead. This works, but can cause massive GC pressure from tons of single-use copies created.</p>

<p>If you have public fields, consider making the class read-only. Add the fields as parameters to the constructor, and mark the fields final. Otherwise make sure you're not exposing internal state, and if you need to construct new instances for a return value, make sure it won't be called excessively.</p>

<p>In C++ the object life time only begins when the constructor finishes (although member variables and base classes are fully constructed before it starts). This explains the behaviour when virtual functions are called and also why the destructor isn't run if there's an exception in the constructor's body.</p>

<p>The problem with the Java/.Net definition of object lifetime is that it's harder to make sure the object always meets its invariant without having to put in special cases for when the object is initialized but the constructor hasn't run.

<p>Because there's no one good behaviour.

<p>Consider the following piece of code that's executed from multiple parallel threads:
</p>

<pre><code>synchronized(this) {
    while(busy) // a loop is necessary here
        wait();
    busy = true;
}
...
synchronized(this) {
    busy = false;
    notifyAll();
}
</code></pre>

<p>It can be made more efficient by using <code>notify()</code>:
</p>

<pre><code>synchronized(this) {
    if(busy)   // replaced the loop with a condition which is evaluated only once
        wait();
    busy = true;
}
...
synchronized(this) {
    busy = false;
    notify();
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the case if you have a large number of threads, or if the wait loop condition is costly to evaluate, <code>notify()</code> will be significantly faster than <code>notifyAll()</code>. For example, if you have 1000 threads then 999 threads will be awakened and evaluated after the first <code>notifyAll()</code>, then 998, then 997, and so on. On the contrary, with the <code>notify()</code> solution, only one thread will be awakened. </p>

<p>Use <code>notifyAll()</code> when you need to choose which thread will do the work next:
</p>

<pre><code>synchronized(this) {
    while(idx != last+1)  // wait until it's my turn
        wait();
}
...
synchronized(this) {
    last = idx;
    notifyAll();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, it's important to understand that in case of <code>notifyAll()</code>, the code inside <code>synchronized</code> blocks that have been awakened will be executed sequentially, not all at once. Let's say there are three threads waiting in the above example, and the fourth thread calls <code>notifyAll()</code>. All three threads will be awakened but only one will start execution and check the condition of the <code>while</code> loop. If the condition is <code>true</code>, it will call <code>wait()</code> again, and only then the second thread will start executing and will check its <code>while</code> loop condition, and so on.</p>

<p>Suppose thread A, B, and C were waiting on this object, and thread A gets the monitor. The difference lies in what happens once A releases the monitor. If you used notify(), then B and C are still blocked in wait(): they are not waiting on the monitor, they are waiting to be notified. When A releases the monitor, B and C will still be sitting there, waiting for a notify().</p>

<p>If you used notifyAll(), then B and C have both advanced past the ""wait for notification"" state and are both waiting to acquire the monitor. When A releases the monitor, either B or C will acquire it (assuming no other threads are competing for that monitor) and begin executing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The notify() method is generally used
  for <strong>resource pools</strong>, where there
  are an arbitrary number of ""consumers""
  or ""workers"" that take resources, but
  when a resource is added to the pool,
  only one of the waiting consumers or
  workers can deal with it. The
  notifyAll() method is actually used in
  most other cases. Strictly, it is
  required to notify waiters of a
  condition that could allow multiple
  waiters to proceed. But this is often
  difficult to know. So as a general
  rule, <strong>if you have no particular
  logic for using notify(), then you
  should probably use notifyAll()</strong>,
  because it is often difficult to know
  exactly what threads will be waiting
  on a particular object and why.</p>

An example would be a set of threads waiting for a certain task to finish; once the task has finished, all waiting threads can continue with their business. In such a case you would use <b>notifyAll()</b> to wake up all waiting threads at the same time.</p>

<p>Another case, for example mutually exclusive locking, only one of the waiting threads can do something useful after being notified (in this case acquire the lock).

<p>I think there's a workaround, though.  Call <code>mTabs.getTabWidget()</code> to get a <code>TabWidget</code> object.  This is just a subclass of <code>ViewGroup</code>, so you can call <code>getChildCount()</code> and <code>getChildAt()</code> to access individual tabs within the <code>TabWidget</code>.  Each of these tabs is also a View, and in the case of a tab with a graphical indicator and a text label, it's almost certainly some other <code>ViewGroup</code> (maybe a <code>LinearLayout</code>, but it doesn't matter) that contains an <code>ImageView</code> and a <code>TextView</code>.  So with a little fiddling with the debugger or <code>Log.i</code>, you should be able to figure out a recipe to get the <code>ImageView</code> and change it directly.</p>

<p>The downside is that if you're not careful, the exact layout of the controls within a tab could change and your app could break.  Your initial solution is perhaps more robust, but then again it might lead to other unwanted side effects like flicker or focus problems.</p>

If you are not sure which to use, then use <code>notifyAll</code>.Please see explanation that follows.</p>

<p>Read very carefully and understand. Please send me an email if you have any questions.</p>

<p>Look at producer/consumer (assumption is a ProducerConsumer class with two methods). IT IS BROKEN (because it uses <code>notify</code>) - yes it MAY work - even most of the time, but it may also cause deadlock - we will see why:</p>

<pre><code>public synchronized void put(Object o) {
    while (buf.size()==MAX_SIZE) {
        wait(); // called if the buffer is full (try/catch removed for brevity)
    }
    buf.add(o);
    notify(); // called in case there are any getters or putters waiting
}

public synchronized Object get() {
    // Y: this is where C2 tries to acquire the lock (i.e. at the beginning of the method)
    while (buf.size()==0) {
        wait(); // called if the buffer is empty (try/catch removed for brevity)
        // X: this is where C1 tries to re-acquire the lock (see below)
    }
    Object o = buf.remove(0);
    notify(); // called if there are any getters or putters waiting
    return o;
}
</code></pre>

<p>FIRSTLY,</p>

<p><strong>Why do we need a while loop surrounding the wait?</strong></p>

<p>We need a <code>while</code> loop in case we get this situation:</p>

<p>Consumer 1 (C1) enter the synchronized block and the buffer is empty, so C1 is put in the wait set (via the <code>wait</code> call). Consumer 2 (C2) is about to enter the synchronized method (at point Y above), but Producer P1 puts an object in the buffer, and subsequently calls <code>notify</code>. The only waiting thread is C1, so it is woken and now attempts to re-acquire the object lock at point X (above).</p>

<p>Now C1 and C2 are attempting to acquire the synchronization lock. One of them (nondeterministically) is chosen and enters the method, the other is blocked (not waiting - but blocked, trying to acquire the lock on the method). Let's say C2 gets the lock first. C1 is still blocking (trying to acquire the lock at X). C2 completes the method and releases the lock. Now, C1 acquires the lock. Guess what, lucky we have a <code>while</code> loop, because, C1 performs the loop check (guard) and is prevented from removing a non-existent element from the buffer (C2 already got it!). If we didn't have a <code>while</code>, we would get an <code>IndexArrayOutOfBoundsException</code> as C1 tries to remove the first element from the buffer!</p>

<p>NOW,</p>

<p><strong>Ok, now why do we need notifyAll?</strong></p>

<p>In the producer/consumer example above it looks like we can get away with <code>notify</code>. It seems this way, because we can prove that the guards on the <em>wait</em> loops for producer and consumer are mutually exclusive. That is, it looks like we cannot have a thread waiting in the <code>put</code> method as well as the <code>get</code> method, because, for that to be true, then the following would have to be true:</p>

<p><code>buf.size() == 0 AND buf.size() == MAX_SIZE</code> (assume MAX_SIZE is not 0)</p>

<p>HOWEVER, this is not good enough, we NEED to use <code>notifyAll</code>. Let's see why ...</p>

<p>Assume we have a buffer of size 1 (to make the example easy to follow). The following steps lead us to deadlock. Note that ANYTIME a thread is woken with notify, it can be non-deterministically selected by the JVM - that is any waiting thread can be woken. Also note that when multiple threads are blocking on entry to a method (i.e. trying to acquire a lock), the order of acquisition can be non-deterministic. Remember also that a thread can only be in one of the methods at any one time - the synchronized methods allow only one thread to be executing (i.e. holding the lock of) any (synchronized) methods in the class. If the following sequence of events occurs - deadlock results:</p>

<p><strong>STEP 1:</strong><BR>
- P1 puts 1 char into the buffer</p>

<p><strong>STEP 2:</strong><BR>
- P2 attempts <code>put</code> - checks wait loop - already a char - waits</p>

<p><strong>STEP 3:</strong><BR>
- P3 attempts <code>put</code> - checks wait loop - already a char - waits</p>

<p><strong>STEP 4:</strong><BR>
- C1 attempts to get 1 char <BR>
- C2 attempts to get 1 char - blocks on entry to the <code>get</code> method<BR>
- C3 attempts to get 1 char - blocks on entry to the <code>get</code> method</p>

<p><strong>STEP 5:</strong><BR>
- C1 is executing the <code>get</code> method - gets the char, calls <code>notify</code>, exits method<BR>
- The <code>notify</code> wakes up P2<BR>
- BUT, C2 enters method before P2 can (P2 must reacquire the lock), so P2 blocks on entry to the <code>put</code> method<BR>
- C2 checks wait loop, no more chars in buffer, so waits<BR>
- C3 enters method after C2, but before P2, checks wait loop, no more chars in buffer, so waits</p>

<p><strong>STEP 6:</strong><BR>
- NOW: there is P3, C2, and C3 waiting!<BR>
- Finally P2 acquires the lock, puts a char in the buffer, calls notify, exits method</p>

<p><strong>STEP 7:</strong><BR>
- P2's notification wakes P3 (remember any thread can be woken)<BR>
- P3 checks the wait loop condition, there is already a char in the buffer, so waits.<BR>
- NO MORE THREADS TO CALL NOTIFY and THREE THREADS PERMANENTLY SUSPENDED!</p>

<p>SOLUTION: Replace <code>notify</code> with <code>notifyAll</code> in the producer/consumer code (above).</p>

<ul>
<li>Just about any automated tool in the java world relies on the getter/setter convention. Ditto for, as noted by others, jsp tags, spring configuration, eclipse tools, etc. etc... 
Fighting against what your tools expect to see is a recipe for long sessions trolling through google trying to find that non-standard way of initiating spring beans. Really not worth the trouble.</li>
<li>Once you have your elegantly coded application with hundreds of public variables you will likely find at least one situation where they're insufficient- where you absolutely need immutability, or you need to trigger some event when the variable gets set, or you want to throw an exception on a variable change because it sets an object state to something unpleasant. You're then stuck with the unenviable choices between  cluttering up your code with some special method everywhere the variable is directly referenced, having some special access form for 3 out of the 1000 variables in your application. </li>
</ul>

<p>And this is in the best case scenario of working entirely in a self-contained private project. Once you export the whole thing to a publicly accessible library these problems will become even larger. </p>

<p>Whether aspect-style is cleaner or not is somewhat qualitative.  I would find it easy to see just the variables in a class and view the logic separately.

<p>I am torn on whether to use getters for the Track objects or just expose the members since the object is immutable.</p>

<pre><code>class Track {
    public final String album;
    public final String artist;
    public final String title;
    public final String genre;
    public final String comment;

    public final String cover_id;

    public final long duration;
    public final long bitrate;
    public final long samplerate;
    public final long id;
    public final Date date;

    /* Some more stuff here */
}
</code></pre>

<p>Anybody who wants to know when something happened to a track in the library would implement this...</p>

<pre><code>interface TrackUpdateListener {
    void trackUpdate(Track oldTrack, Track newTrack);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is how querys are built. Chain calls to your hearts content. the jury is still out on the get() though. There are some details missing, such as how I should handle wildcards and more advanced queries with disjunctions. I might just need some completion callback functionality, perhaps similar to the <a href=""http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~schmidt/PDF/ACT.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Asynchronous Completion Token</a>, but we'll see about that. Perhaps that will happen in an additional layer.</p>

<pre><code>interface TrackQuery extends Iterable&lt;Track&gt; {
    TrackQuery years(int from, int to);
    TrackQuery artist(String name);
    TrackQuery album(String name);
    TrackQuery id(long id);
    TrackQuery ids(long id[]);

    Future&lt;Track[]&gt; get();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<pre><code>tracks.allTracks();
tracks.allTracks().artist(""Front 242"").album(""Tyranny (For You)"");
</code></pre>

<p>The tracks interface is mostly just the glue between the connection and the individual tracks. It will be the one implementing or managing meta-data caching, if any (as today, but I think I'll just remove it during the refactoring and see if I actually need it). Also, this provides medialib track updates as it would just be too much work to implement it by track.</p>

<pre><code>interface Tracks {
    TrackQuery allTracks();

    void addUpdateListener(TrackUpdateListener listener);
    void removeUpdateListener(TrackUpdateListener listener);
}

You cannot write virtual functions to, for instance, return the desired size of the object, and have the default constructor initialize each item. For instance it would be nice to do:</p>

<p><code>BaseClass() {
   for (int i=0; i&lt;virtualSize(); i++)
     initialize_stuff_for_index(i);
}</code></p>

<p>Then again the advantage of C++ behavior is that it discourages constuctors like the above from being written.</p>

<p>I don't think the problem of calling methods that assume the constructor has been finished is a good excuse for C++. If this really was a problem then the constructor would not be allowed to call <em>any</em> methods, since the same problem can apply to methods for the base class.</p>

<p>Another point against C++ is that the behavior is much less efficient. Although the constructor knows directly what it calls, the vtab pointer has to be changed for every single class from base to final, because the constructor might call other methods that will call virtual functions. From my experience this wastes far more time than is saved by making virtual functions calls in the constructor more efficient.</p>

<p>Far more annoying is that this is also true of destructors. If you write a virtual cleanup() function, and the base class destructor does cleanup(), it certainly does not do what you expect.</p>

<p>This and the fact that C++ calls destructors on static objects on exit have really pissed me off for a long time.</p>

In Windows 32 bit this is around 2gb (not specifically heap but total amount of memory per process). It just happens that Java happens to make the default smaller (presumably so that the programmer can't create programs that have runaway memory allocation without running into this problem and having to examine exactly what they are doing).</p>

<p>So this given there are several approaches you could take to either determine what amount of memory you need or to reduce the amount of memory you are using. One common mistake with garbage collected languages such as Java or C# is to keep around references to objects that you no longer are using, or allocating many objects when you could reuse them instead. As long as objects have a reference to them they will continue to use heap space as the garbage collector will not delete them.</p>

<p>In this case you can use a Java memory profiler to determine what methods in your program are allocating large number of objects and then determine if there is a way to make sure they are no longer referenced, or to not allocate them in the first place. One option which I have used in the past is ""JMP"" <a href=""http://www.khelekore.org/jmp/"">http://www.khelekore.org/jmp/</a>.</p>

<p>If you determine that you are allocating these objects for a reason and you need to keep around references (depending on what you are doing this might be the case), you will just need to increase the max heap size when you start the program. However, once you do the memory profiling and understand how your objects are getting allocated you should have a better idea about how much memory you need. </p>

<p>In general if you can't guarantee that your program will run in some finite amount of memory (perhaps depending on input size) you will always run into this problem. Only after exhausting all of this will you need to look into caching objects out to disk etc. At this point you should have a very good reason to say ""I need Xgb of memory"" for something and you can't work around it by improving your algorithms or memory allocation patterns. Generally this will only usually be the case for algorithms operating on large datasets (like a database or some scientific analysis program) and then techniques like caching and memory mapped IO become useful.</p>

  <p>is there a way to choose which processor or core it is launched on?</p>

<p>You can use the task manager to tell windows what CPU(s) your program should be allowed to run on. Normally this is only useful for troubleshooting legacy programs which have broken implementations of multi-threading. To do this, </p>

<ul>
<li>Run task manager</li>
<li>Find your process in the <code>Processes</code> window.</li>
<li>Right click and choose <code>Set Affinity...</code></li>
<li>Tick the checkboxes next to the CPU's you want to allow your application to run on. Windows will then only schedule threads from that process onto those particular CPU's</li>
</ul>

<p>If I recall correctly, windows will 'remember' these settings for subsequent times your process is run, but please don't quote me on that - run some tests yourself :-)</p>

<p>You can also do this programatically in .NET after your program has launched using using the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.process.processoraffinity.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">System.Diagnostics.Process.ProcessorAffinity</a> property, but I don't think it will 'remember' the settings, so there will always be a short period in which your app is run on whichever CPU windows sees fit. I don't know how to do this in java sorry.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>This applies at the entire process level. If you set affinity for CPU0 only, and then launch 50 threads, all 50 of those threads will run on CPU0, and CPU1, 2, 3, etc will sit around doing nothing.</p>

<p>Just to reiterate the point, this is primarily useful for troubleshooting broken legacy software. If your software is not broken, you really shouldn't mess with any of these settings, and let windows decide the best CPU(s) to run your program on, so it can take the rest of the system's performance into account.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>As for the 'shared memory' model, it works the same, but there are more things that can go subtly wrong when your app is running on multiple CPU's as opposed to just timeslices on a single one.</p>

<p>For an eye-opening example, read <a href=""http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/archives/2007/02/17/barrier/"" rel=""nofollow"">this ridiculousfish article about CPU's and Memory Barriers</a>.</p>

I ran up against this too. My solution was to represent the desired inheritance through interfaces rather than the entity beans themselves.</p>

<p>In your case, you could define the following:</p>

<pre><code>public interface Problem {
    public Person getPerson();
}

public interface UglyProblem extends Problem {

<p>Then implement these interfaces using an abstract superclass and two entity subclasses:</p>

<pre><code>@MappedSuperclass
public abstract class AbstractProblemImpl implements Problem {
    @ManyToOne
    private Person person;

    public Person getPerson() {
        return person;
    }
}

@Entity
public class ProblemImpl extends AbstractProblemImpl implements Problem {
}

@Entity
public class UglyProblemImpl extends AbstractProblemImpl implements UglyProblem {
}

<p>As an added benefit, if you code using the interfaces rather than the actual entity beans that implement those interfaces, it makes it easier to change the underlying mappings later on (less risk of breaking compatibility).</p>

<p>There are no classes that might take a long time to load (or be unavailable). The classpath includes only local jars.</p>

<p>Actually there is more than one classloader, each of which might be contending for some resource and becoming blocked as a result. </p>

<p>Since the use of Groovy was removed from the application (it caused a memory leak in PermGen and wasn't really needed), we haven't seen any additional cases of the block. So this might be what was causing the problem. But I'd like to be able to at least have a definite method of reproducing before declaring it fixed.</p>

<p>The biggest problem here is that the lock is around a monitor entry which is in native code, seemingly pointing to a bug in the JVM. I don't know of any requirements to synchronize access to methods which use reflection and/or classloaders.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no obviously deadlocking monitor. None of the values identifying monitors are repeated in a thread dump. If there were I would have noticed: I think the JVM reports suspected deadlocked threads, and there is also the [Thread Dump Analyzer][1] visualvm plugin that helps find problems in thread dumps.</p>

<p>For example, say you have an object of an unknown type in Java, and you would like to call a 'doSomething' method on it if one exists. Java's static typing system isn't really designed to support this unless the object conforms to a known interface, but using reflection, your code can look at the object and find out if it has a method called 'doSomething', and then, call it if you want to.</p>

<p>So, to give you a code example of this in Java (imagine the object in question is foo) :</p>

<pre><code>Method method = foo.getClass().getMethod(""doSomething"", null);
method.invoke(foo, null);
</code></pre>

<p>One very common use case in Java is the usage with annotations. JUnit 4, for example, will use reflection to look through your classes for methods tagged with the @Test annotation, and will then call them when running the unit test.</p>

<p>There are some good reflection examples to get you started at <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/index.html"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/index.html</a></p>

<p>And finally, yes, the concepts are pretty much similar in other statically types languages which support reflection (like C#). In dynamically typed languages, the use case described above is less necessary (since the compiler will allow any method to be called on any object, failing at runtime if it does not exist), but the second case of looking for methods which are marked or work in a certain way is still common.</p>

If you were doing ""Class.byName"" or any other type of reflection stuff, you needed to tell the obfuscator because it couldn't tell by inspecting the code what classes or methods called by reflection.</p>

<p>The problem, of course, is that you don't know if other parts of the third party library are doing any reflection, and so removing an ""unused"" class might cause things to break in an obscure case that you haven't tested.</p>

//Here the method takes a string parameter if there is no param, put null.
Method method = aClass.getMethod(""method_name"", String.class); 

Object returnValue = method.invoke(null, ""parameter-value1"");

<p>In above example the null parameter is the object you want to invoke the method on. If the method is static you supply null. If the method is not static, then while invoking you need to supply a valid MyObject instance instead of null.</p>

<p>Reflection also allows you to access private member/methods of a class:</p>

<pre><code>public class A{

  private String str= null;

  public A(String str) {
  this.str= str;
  }
}

But, then you say that one <strong>Person</strong> have many <strong>UglyProblem</strong>s (and does not relate to other <strong>Problem</strong>s). Something is wrong with that design.</p>

<p>Imagine how it's going to be mapped to the database. You have a single table inheritance, so:</p>

<pre><code>          _____________
          |__PROBLEMS__|          |__PEOPLE__|
          |id &lt;PK&gt;     |          |          |

<p>How is hibernate going to enforce the database to make <strong>Problem</strong> only relate to <strong>People</strong> if its <strong>problemType</strong> is equal UP? That's a very difficult problem to solve. So, if you want this kind of relation, every subclass must be in it's own table. That's what <em>@MappedSuperclass</em> does.</p>

If the tool does only line coverage, this statement will be considered 100% covered even if it always executes the same branch.

<p>Code coverage doesn't directly help you write better code, but it does help you write better tests, which in turn help you write better code.

<p>Other thing you should do is, when the user opens a file, load it, and intercept any OutOfMemoryError, then (as it is not possible to open the file) close that file, clean its objects and warn the user that he should close unused files.</p>

<p>--> Keep on mind that if you put something into a collection and afterwards forget about it, you still have a strong reference to it, so nullify the collection, clean it or do something with it... if not you will find a memory leak difficult to find.</p>

<p>--> Maybe, using collections with weak references (weakhashmap...) can help with memory issues, but you <strong>must</strong> be carefull with it, for you might find that the object you look for has been collected.</p>

<p>This solution was also what I tried first. However the problem with this solution is that invokeLater invokes the event calls after the events on the EventQueue are consumed. Since I want the dialog to be modal to the parent frame, the current event which calls setVisible for the dialog on the EDT cannot be finished until the dialog is closed. Therefore, the animation cannot be shown before the dialog is closed. However, this approach works very well for non-modal dialogs.</p>

<p>I think, the best solution is being able to pump events into the eventQueue, just like the way swing handles modal dialogs. However those methods of EventQueue class are all protected, I couldn't find a way to mimic that approach.<br />
Another solution might be waiting until the java version with multiple event dispatching threads :)</p>

<p>About the size of the dialog, it's possible to obtain correct size, after the pack() is called for the dialog.</p>

<p>However, there are times when you can't use a tool: the heap dump is so huge it crashes the tool, you are trying to troubleshoot a machine in some production environment to which you only have shell access, etc.</p>

<p>In that case, it helps to know your way around the hprof dump file.</p>

<p>Look for SITES BEGIN. This shows you what objects are using the most memory. But the objects aren't lumped together solely by type: each entry also includes a ""trace"" ID. You can then search for that ""TRACE nnnn"" to see the top few frames of the stack where the object was allocated. Often, once I see where the object is allocated, I find a bug and I'm done. Also, note that you can control how many frames are recorded in the stack with the options to -Xrunhprof.</p>

<p>If you check out the allocation site, and don't see anything wrong, you have to start backward chaining from some of those live objects to root objects, to find the unexpected reference chain. This is where a tool really helps, but you can do the same thing by hand (well, with grep). There is not just one root object (i.e., object not subject to garbage collection). Threads, classes, and stack frames act as root objects, and anything they reference strongly is not collectible.</p>

<p>To do the chaining, look in the HEAP DUMP section for entries with the bad trace id. This will take you to an OBJ or ARR entry, which shows a unique object identifier in hexadecimal. Search for all occurrences of that id to find who's got a strong reference to the object. Follow each of those paths backward as they branch until you figure out where the leak is. See why a tool is so handy?</p>

<p>Static members are a repeat offender for memory leaks. In fact, even without a tool, it'd be worth spending a few minutes looking through your code for static Map members. Can a map grow large? Does anything ever clean up its entries?</p>

<p>What is really cool about this tool is that it indexed the heap dump when I first opened it which allowed it to show data like retained heap without waiting 5 minutes for each object (pretty much all operations was tons faster than the other tools I tried).</p>

That doesn't happen until you get the stream from the URLConnection().  When you first get the connection you can add/change headers and other connection properties before actually opening it.</p>

<p>URLConnection's lifecycle is a bit odd.  It doesn't send the headers to the server until you've gotten one of the streams.  If you just get the input stream then I believe it does a GET, sends the headers, then lets you read the output.  If you get the output stream then I believe it sends it as a POST, as it assumes you'll be writing data to it (You may need to call setDoOutput(true) for the output stream to work).  As soon as you get the input stream the output stream is closed and it waits for the response from the server.</p>

<p>For example, this should do a POST:</p>

<pre><code>URL myURL = new URL(""http://example.com/my/path"");
URLConnection conn = myURL.openConnection();
conn.setDoOutput(true);
conn.setDoInput(true);

OutputStream os = conn.getOutputStream();
os.write(""Hi there!"");
os.close();

InputStream is = conn.getInputStream();
// read stuff here
</code></pre>

<p>While this would do a GET:</p>

<pre><code>URL myURL = new URL(""http://example.com/my/path"");
URLConnection conn = myURL.openConnection();
conn.setDoOutput(false);
conn.setDoInput(true);

InputStream is = conn.getInputStream();
// read stuff here
</code></pre>

<p>URLConnection will also do other weird things.  If the server specifies a content length then URLConnection will keep the underlying input stream open until it receives that much data, <em>even if you explicitly close it</em>.  This caused a lot of problems for us as it made shutting our client down cleanly a bit hard, as the URLConnection would keep the network connection open.  This probably probably exists even if you just use getStream() though.</p>

<p>In general, java has primitive types (<code>int</code>, <code>bool</code>, <code>char</code>, <code>double</code>, etc) that are passed directly by value. Then java has objects (everything that derives from <code>java.lang.Object</code>). Objects are actually always handled through a reference (a reference being a pointer that you can't touch). That means that in effect, objects are passed by value, as the references are normally not interesting. It does however mean that you cannot change which object is pointed to as the reference itself is passed by value.</p>

<p>Does this sound strange and confusing? Let's consider how C implements pass by reference and pass by value. In C the default convention is pass by value. <code>void foo(int x)</code> passes an int by value. <code>void foo(int *x)</code> is a function that does not want an <code>int a</code>, but a pointer to an int: <code>foo(&amp;a)</code>. One would use this with the <code>&amp;</code> operator to pass a variable address.</p>

<p>Take this to C++, and we have references. References are basically (in this context) syntactic sugar that hide the pointer part of the equation: <code>void foo(int &amp;x)</code> is called by <code>foo(a)</code>, where the compiler itself knows that it is a reference and the address of the non-reference <code>a</code> should be passed. In java, all variables referring to objects are actually of reference type, in effect forcing call by reference for most intends and purposes without the fine grained control (and complexity) afforded by e.g. C++.</p>

<p>A very common idiom is to ""check then put"" - i.e. look for an entry in the Map, and add it if it does not already exist.  This is not in any way an atomic operation whether you use Hashtable or HashMap.  </p>

<p>An equivalently synchronised HashMap can be obtained by:</p>

<pre><code>Collections.synchronizedMap(myMap);

<p>But to correctly implement this logic you need <strong>additional synchronisation</strong> of the form:</p>

<pre><code>synchronized(myMap) {
    if (!myMap.containsKey(""tomato"")
        myMap.put(""tomato"", ""red"");
}

<p>Even iterating over a Hashtable's entries (or a HashMap obtained by Collections.synchronizedMap) is not thread safe unless you also guard the Map from being modified through additional synchronization.</p>

<p>Implementations of the ConcurrentMap interface (for example ConcurrentHashMap) solve some of this by including <strong>thread safe check-then-act semantics</strong> such as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unsafe:</p>
  
  <p>Characters can be unsafe for a number of reasons.  The space
    character is unsafe because significant spaces may disappear and
    insignificant spaces may be introduced when URLs are transcribed or
    typeset or subjected to the treatment of word-processing programs.
    The characters ""&lt;"" and "">"" are unsafe because they are used as the
    delimiters around URLs in free text; the quote mark ("""""") is used to
    delimit URLs in some systems.  The character ""#"" is unsafe and should
    always be encoded because it is used in World Wide Web and in other
    systems to delimit a URL from a fragment/anchor identifier that might
    follow it.  The character ""%"" is unsafe because it is used for
    encodings of other characters.  Other characters are unsafe because
    gateways and other transport agents are known to sometimes modify
    such characters. These characters are ""{"", ""}"", ""|"", ""\"", ""^"", ""~"",
    ""["", ""]"", and ""`"".</p>
  
  <p>All unsafe characters must always be encoded within a URL. For
    example, the character ""#"" must be encoded within URLs even in
    systems that do not normally deal with fragment or anchor
    identifiers, so that if the URL is copied into another system that
    does use them, it will not be necessary to change the URL encoding.</p>

<p>Each node needn't be immutable internally to the package, only to the outward-facing interface. <code>node.addChild()</code> would be an immutable function with public visibility and return a Document, wheras <code>node.addChildInternal()</code> would be be a normal, mutable function with package visibility. But since it is internal to the package, it can only be called as a descendent of <code>addChild()</code> and the structure as a whole is guarenteed to be thread safe (provided I synchronize access to the object pool). Do you see a flaw in this...? If so, please tell me!</p>

  <p>I think that using immutable nodes is probably not going to give you the kind of thread-safety you need in the first place. What happens if 1 thread is iterating over the nodes (a search or something), while another thread is adding/removing nodes?</p>

<p>The tree as a whole will be immutable. Say I have Thread1 and Thread2, and tree dom1. Thread1 starts a read operation on dom1, while, concurrently, Thread2 starts a write operation on dom1. However, all the changes Thread2 makes will actually be made to a new object, dom2, and dom1 will be immutable. It is true that the values read by Thread1 will be (a few microseconds) out of date, but it won't crash on an IndexOutOfBounds or NullPointer exception or something like it would if it was reading a mutable object that was being written to. Then, Thread2 can fire an event containing dom2 to Thread1 so that it can do its read again and update its results, if necessary.</p>

<p>One specific case you need to synchronize one side or the other of making a newly created node available to other threads as otherwise you risk the VM/CPU re-ordering the writes of the fields past the write of the reference to the shared node, exposing a party constructed object.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Try to think in a higher level. You have an IMMUTABLE tree (that is basically a set of nodes pointing to its children). You want to insert a node in it. Then, there's no way out: you have to create a new WHOLE tree.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you choose to implement the tree as a set of nodes pointing to the children, then you would have to create new nodes along the path of the changed node to the root. The others have the same value as before, and normally are shared. So you need to create a partial new tree, which usually would mean (depth of edited node) parent nodes.  </p>

<p>If you can cope with a less direct implementation, you should be able to get away with only creating parts of nodes, using techniques similar to those described in <a href=""http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SxPzSTcTalAC"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Purely Functional Data Structures"">Purely Functional Data Structures</a> to either reduce the average cost of the creation, or you can by-pass it using semi-functional approaches (such as creating an iterator which wraps an existing iterator, but returns the new node instead of the old, together with a mechanism to repair such patches in the structure as time goes on). An XPath style api might be better than a DOM api in that case - it might you decouple the nodes from the tree a bit more, and treat the mutated tree more intelligently. </p>

Treat each JSP imported as a black box, and refactor these pages around them (iteratively, testing each change and making sure it works before continuing).  Once these are cleaned up, you can continue finding pages with more and more imports, until finally you have refactored the imports.</p>

<p>When refactoring, note the parts that try to access resources not given to the page and try to take this out to a controller.  For instance, anything that accesses the database should be inside a controller, let the JSP handle the display of the information the controller gives to it via a forward.  In this way you will develop several servlets, or things like servlets, for each page.  I would suggest using a front-controller based framework for this refactoring (from personal experience I recommend Spring and its Controller interface), so that each controller isn't a separate Servlet but is rather delegated to from a single servlet that is mapped appropriately.</p>

<p>For the controller, it is better to do database hits all at once rather than attempt them piecemeal.  Users can and generally do tolerate a page load, but the page output will be much faster if all the database data is given to the rendering code rather than the rendering code hanging and not giving data to the client while it is trying to read yet another piece of data from the database.</p>

<p>JPA is the latest Java API for Persistence which basically allows one to map Plain Old Java Object (AKA PoJo) to RDBMS Table Structures. There are multiple known implementation available but I would recommend Hibernate or TopLink as good starting points.</p>

It is the output of the built-in Date.toString() method (at least in the UK and US locales).

<p>What this means is that you are likely to receive this input format when you output an unformatted date into a user-modifiable field (e.g. an HTML INPUT field) and receive it back unmodified. So just because input is coming in this format, doesn't mean the users will type in a thousand other arbitrary formats.</p>

<p>Of course, they still might. The way I handle date inputs in general is with a bunch of try/catch blocks, where I try it against one format, then another, then another. Our standard framework is now up to about 20 different formats by default. Of course it is still not perfect; I found someone the other day entering ""03 Sept"" as the date (a non-standard month abbreviation, and with no year) and we hadn't handled that scenario.</p>

<p>A non-colliding number that allows you to quickly compare strings would necessarily grow exponentially with the length of the string.</p>

<p>So you <em>first</em> must decide on the longest string you are expecting to compare.  Assuming it's N characters in length, and assuming you ONLY need uppercase letters and the numerals 0-9 then you need to have an integer representation that can be as high as
36^N</p>

<p>For a string of length 25 (common name field) then you end up needing a binary number with  130 bits.</p>

<p>If you compose that into 32 bit numbers, you'll need 4.  Then you can compare each number (four integer compares should take no time, compared to walking the string).  I would recommend a big number library, but for this specialized case I'm pretty sure you can write your own and get better performance.</p>

<p>If you want to handle 72 possible values per character (uppercase, lowercase, numerals, punctuation...) and you need 10 characters, then you'll need 62 bits - two 32 bit integers (or one 64 bit if you're on a system that supports 64 bit computing)</p>

<p>If, however, you are not able to restrict the numbers in the string (ie, could be any of the 256 letters/numbers/characters/etc) and you can't define the size of the string, then comparing the strings directly is the only way to go, but there's a shortcut.</p>

<p>Cast the pointer of the string to a 32 bit unsigned integer array, and compare the string 4 bytes at a time (or 64 bits/8bytes at a time on a 64 bit processor).  This means that a 100 character string only requires 25 compares maximum to find which is greater.</p>

<p>You may need to re-define the character set (and convert the strings) so that the characters with higher precedence are assigned values closer to 0, and lower precedence values closer to 255 (or vice versa, depending on how you are comparing them).</p>

<p><em>What is the order of iteration</em> - if you are just using <code>Map</code>, then strictly speaking, there are <strong>no ordering guarantees</strong>.  So you shouldn't really rely on the ordering given by any implementation.  However, the <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/SortedMap.html""><code>SortedMap</code></a> interface extends <code>Map</code> and provides exactly what you are looking for - implementations will aways give a consistent sort order.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/NavigableMap.html""><code>NavigableMap</code></a> is another useful extension</strong> - this is a <code>SortedMap</code> with additional methods for finding entries by their ordered position in the key set.  So potentially this can remove the need for iterating in the first place - you might be able to find the specific <code>entry</code> you are after using the <code>higherEntry</code>, <code>lowerEntry</code>, <code>ceilingEntry</code>, or <code>floorEntry</code> methods.  The <code>descendingMap</code> method even gives you an explicit method of <strong>reversing the traversal order</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are three advantages of Java
  using byte code instead of going to
  the native code of the system:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p><strong>Portability</strong>: Each kind of computer has its unique instruction
  set. While some processors include the
  instructions for their predecessors,
  it's generally true that a program
  that runs on one kind of computer
  won't run on any other. Add in the
  services provided by the operating
  system, which each system describes in
  its own unique way, and you have a
  compatibility problem. In general, you
  can't write and compile a program for
  one kind of system and run it on any
  other without a lot of work. Java gets
  around this limitation by inserting
  its virtual machine between the
  application and the real environment
  (computer + operating system). If an
  application is compiled to Java byte
  code and that byte code is interpreted
  the same way in every environment then
  you can write a single program which
  will work on all the different
  platforms where Java is supported.
  (That's the theory, anyway. In
  practice there are always small
  incompatibilities lying in wait for
  the programmer.)</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Security</strong>: One of Java's virtues is its integration into the Web. Load
  a web page that uses Java into your
  browser and the Java code is
  automatically downloaded and executed.
  But what if the code destroys files,
  whether through malice or sloppiness
  on the programmer's part? Java
  prevents downloaded applets from doing
  anything destructive by disallowing
  potentially dangerous operations.
  Before it allows the code to run it
  examines it for attempts to bypass
  security. It verifies that data is
  used consistently: code that
  manipulates a data item as an integer
  at one stage and then tries to use it
  as a pointer later will be caught and
  prevented from executing. (The Java
  language doesn't allow pointer
  arithmetic, so you can't write Java
  code to do what we just described.
  However, there is nothing to prevent
  someone from writing destructive byte
  code themselves using a hexadecimal
  editor or even building a Java byte
  code assembler.) It generally isn't
  possible to analyze a program's
  machine code before execution and
  determine whether it does anything
  bad. Tricks like writing
  self-modifying code mean that the evil
  operations may not even exist until
  later. But Java byte code was designed
  for this kind of validation: it
  doesn't have the instructions a
  malicious programmer would use to hide
  their assault.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Size</strong>: In the microprocessor world RISC is generally preferable
  over CISC. It's better to have a small
  instruction set and use many fast
  instructions to do a job than to have
  many complex operations implemented as
  single instructions. RISC designs
  require fewer gates on the chip to
  implement their instructions, allowing
  for more room for pipelines and other
  techniques to make each instruction
  faster. In an interpreter, however,
  none of this matters. If you want to
  implement a single instruction for the
  switch statement with a variable
  length depending on the number of case
  clauses, there's no reason not to do
  so. In fact, a complex instruction set
  is an advantage for a web-based
  language: it means that the same
  program will be smaller (fewer
  instructions of greater complexity),
  which means less time to transfer
  across our speed-limited network.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>So when considering byte code vs native, consider which trade-offs you want to make between portability, security, size, and execution speed. If speed is the only important factor, go native. If any of the others are more important, go with bytecode.</p>

<p>I'll also add that maintaining a series of OS and architecture-targeted compilations of the same code base for every release can become very tedious. It's a huge win to use the same Java bytecode on multiple platforms and have it ""just work.""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Atwood: Well, I originally asked on Twitter, because I just wanted something light weight.  I really didn't want to like write a windows service.  I felt like that was out of band code. Plus the code that actually does the work is a web page in fact, because to me that is a logical unit of work on a website is a web page.  So, it really is like we are calling back into the web site, it's just like another request in the website, so I viewed it as something that should stay inline, and the little approach that we came up that was recommended to me on Twitter was to essentially to add something to the application cache with a fixed expiration, then you have a call back so when that expires it calls a certain function which does the work then you add it back in to the cache with the same expiration.  So, it's a little bit, maybe ""ghetto"" is the right word.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My approach has always been to have to OS (i.e. Cron or the Windows task scheduler) load a specific URL at some interval, and then setup a page at that URL to check it's queue, and perform whatever tasks were required, but I'd be interested to hear if there's a better way.</p>

<p>From the transcript, it looks like FogBugz uses the windows service loading a URL approach also.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Spolsky: So we have this special page called heartbeat.asp.  And that page, whenever you hit it, and anybody can hit it at anytime: doesn't hurt.  But when that page runs it checks a queue of waiting tasks to see if there's anything that needs to be done.  And if there's anything that needs to be done, it does one thing and then looks in that queue again and if there's anything else to be done it returns a plus, and the entire web page that it returns is just a single character with a plus in it.  And if there's nothing else to be done, the queue is now empty, it returns a minus.  So, anybody can call this and hit it as many times, you can load up heartbeat.asp in your web browser you hit Ctrl-R Ctrl-R Ctrl-R Ctrl-R until you start getting minuses instead of pluses.  And when you've done that FogBugz will have completed all of its maintenance work that it needs to do.  So that's the first part, and the second part is a very, very simple Windows service which runs, and its whole job is to call heartbeat.asp and if it gets a plus, call it again soon, and if it gets a minus call it again, but not for a while.  So basically there's this Windows service that's always running, that has a very, very, very simple task of just hitting a URL, and looking to see if it gets a plus or a minus and, and then scheduling when it runs again based on whether it got a plus or a minus.  And obviously you can do any kind of variation you want on this theme, like for example, uh you could actually, instead of returning just a plus or minus you could say ""Okay call me back in 60 seconds"" or ""Call me back right away I have more work to be done.""  And that's how it works... so that maintenance service it just runs, you know, it's like, you know, a half page of code that runs that maintenance service, and it never has to change, and it doesn't have any of the logic in there, it just contains the tickling that causes these web pages to get called with a certain guaranteed frequency.  And inside that web page at heartbeat.asp there's code that maintains a queue of tasks that need to be done and looks at how much time has elapsed and does, you know, late-night maintenance and every seven days delete all the older messages that have been marked as spam and all kinds of just maintenance background tasks.  And uh, that's how that does that.</p>

<pre><code>String a = b + c + d;

<pre><code>String a = new StringBuilder(b).append(c).append(d).toString();

<p>which for large strings is significantly more efficient.  As far as I know, this does not happen when you use the concat method.</p>

<p>However, the concat method is more efficient when concatenating an empty String onto an existing String.  In this case, the JVM does not need to create a new String object and can simply return the existing one.  See <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#concat(java.lang.String)"">the concat documentation</a> to confirm this.</p>

<p>So if you're super-concerned about efficiency then you should use the concat method when concatenating possibly-empty Strings, and use + otherwise.  However, the performance difference should be negligible and you probably shouldn't ever worry about this.</p>

<p>Firstly, there's a slight difference in semantics. If a is null, then the latter NPEs but the former will treat the original value of a as if it were ""null"".</p>

<p>To look under the hood, write a simple class with a += b;</p>

<pre><code>public class Concat {
    String cat(String a, String b) {
        a += b;
        return a;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now disassemble with javap -c (included in the Sun JDK). You should see a listing including:</p>

<pre><code>java.lang.String cat(java.lang.String, java.lang.String);
  Code:
   0:   new     #2; //class java/lang/StringBuilder
   3:   dup
   4:   invokespecial   #3; //Method java/lang/StringBuilder.""&lt;init&gt;"":()V
   7:   aload_1
   8:   invokevirtual   #4; //Method java/lang/StringBuilder.append:(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;
   11:  aload_2
   12:  invokevirtual   #4; //Method java/lang/StringBuilder.append:(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;
   15:  invokevirtual   #5; //Method java/lang/StringBuilder.toString:()Ljava/lang/    String;
   18:  astore_1
   19:  aload_1
   20:  areturn

<p>So, a += b is the equivalent of</p>

<pre><code>a = new StringBuilder()
    .append(a)
    .append(b)
    .toString();
</code></pre>

<p>The concat method should be faster. However, with more strings the StringBuilder method wins, at least in terms of performance.</p>

<p>The source code of String and StringBuilder (and its package-private base class) is available in src.zip of the Sun JDK.

<li><strong>TreeSet</strong> keeps the data ordered, therefore is slower than HashSet.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Map:</strong> The performance and behavior of HashMap and TreeMap are parallel to the Set implementations.</p>

It doesn't matter so much whether those games are Java or C++, so long as they demonstrate your ideas and abilities. However I think you should set your expectations that if you make it into in the industry, you probably won't be using Java.</p>

<p>Casual web-based games have moved away from Java to Flash, because a considerably higher percentage of casual web surfers have Flash installed than have a JRE.</p>

<p>Console and PC games do not use Java to any extent. They are primarily C++ right now.</p>

<p>High end smartphones (Symbian, Windows Mobile, iPhone, etc) have native SDKs, and if they support Java at all tend to discourage its use. Blackberry is Java based, but there are relatively few games for the Blackberry. I'd have to speculate there is not much demand for games on that device.</p>

<p>The one place where Java is commonly used for games is in low end mobile phones. This has not been a terribly successful category, only a few companies have made money. There are two problems with this space, so far as I can tell:<br />
* write-once-run-anywhere never worked out. The QA and testing load to support a reasonable selection of devices is demanding, and never-ending since new phones come out all the time.<br />
* To distribute your game you need a business relationship with the wireless carrier, and they demand a 50% (or more) cut.  </p>

<p>One last thing: the games industry is famous for programmer burnout. You should search Google for stories about developers at Electronic Arts. Games nowadays are extraordinarily large projects which <em>must</em> meet a particular deadline to have a chance at making their sales targets, and they ratchet up the hours as needed to meet that deadline. Developer burnout is handled via the never-ending supply of young developers enamored with developing games for a living, i.e. replace burned out engineers with fresh ones.</p>

<li><p>List comprehensions.  I often find myself filtering/mapping lists, and being able to say <code>[line.replace(""spam"",""eggs"") for line in open(""somefile.txt"") if line.startswith(""nee"")]</code> is really nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Functions are first class objects.  They can be passed as parameters to other functions, defined inside other function, and have lexical scope.  This makes it really easy to say things like <code>people.sort(key=lambda p: p.age)</code> and thus sort a bunch of people on their age without having to define a custom comparator class or something equally verbose.</p></li>
<li><p>Everything is an object.  Java has basic types which aren't objects, which is why many classes in the standard library define 9 different versions of functions (for boolean, byte, char, double, float, int, long, Object, short).  <code>Array.sort</code> is a good example.  Autoboxing helps, although it makes things awkward when something turns out to be null.</p></li>
<li><p>Properties.  Python lets you create classes with read-only fields, lazily-generated fields, as well as fields which are checked upon assignment to make sure they're never 0 or null or whatever you want to guard against, etc.'</p></li>
<li><p>Default and keyword arguments.  In Java if you want a constructor that can take up to 5 optional arguments, you must define 6 different versions of that constructor.  And there's no way at all to say <code>Student(name=""Eli"", age=25)</code></p></li>
<li><p>Functions can only return 1 thing.  In Python you have tuple assignment, so you can say <code>spam, eggs = nee()</code> but in Java you'd need to either resort to mutable out parameters or have a custom class with 2 fields and then have two additional lines of code to extract those fields.</p></li>
<li><p>Built-in syntax for lists and dictionaries.</p></li>
<li><p>Operator Overloading.</p></li>
<li><p>Generally better designed libraries.  For example, to parse an XML document in Java, you say<br />
<code>Document doc = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance().newDocumentBuilder().parse(""test.xml"");</code><br />
and in Python you say<br />
<code>doc = parse(""test.xml"")</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Anyway, I could go on and on with further examples, but Python is just overall a much more flexible and expressive language.  It's also dynamically typed, which I really like, but which comes with some disadvantages.</p>

<p>Java has much better performance than Python and has way better tool support.  Sometimes those things matter a lot and Java is the better language than Python for a task; I continue to use Java for some new projects despite liking Python a lot more.  But as a language I think Python is superior for most things I find myself needing to accomplish.</p>

Once a row is loaded from the DB, any subsequent fetches for a row with the same PK will return the data from this cache. Furthermore, Hibernate gaurentees reference equality for objects with the same PK in a single Session. </p>

<p>From what I understand, your read-only server application never closes its Hibernate session. So when the DB gets updated by the read-write application, the Session on read-only server is unaware of the change. Effectively, your read-only application is loading an in-memory copy of the database and using that copy, which gets stale in due course.</p>

<p>The simplest and best course of action I can suggest is to close and open Sessions as needed. This sidesteps the whole problem. Hibernate Sessions are intended to be a window for a short-lived interaction with the DB. I agree that there is a performance gain by not reloading the object-graph again and again; but you need to measure it and convince yourself that it is worth the pains.</p>

<p>Another option is to close and reopen the Session periodically. This ensures that the read-only application works with data not older than a given time interval. But there definitely is a window where the read-only application works with stale data (although the design guarantees that it gets the up-to-date data eventually). This might be permissible in many applications - you need to evaluate your situation. </p>

<p>The third option is to use a <i>second level cache</i> implementation, and use short-lived Sessions. There are various caching packages that work with Hibernate with relative merits and demerits.</p>

We spent a lot of time working out niggling speed issues, which seemed to vary greatly from machine to machine. The results were interesting though and Java is definitely capable of producing a playable game.</p>

<p>However, Java just isn't fast enough and there aren't enough viable engines around yet for the game industry to embrace fully and the relevant API's (3D especially) can be quite intimidating if your background is not in mathematics and/or complex OO design. However, the mobile market for Java games is, as @CiNN says, very much a growth industry.</p>

<p>I'd recommend taking a look at some of the open source C++ engines that are out there, and focussing on that.</p>

<p>If you are hell bent on attacking Java for games I recommend this book, it'll give you general concepts of how games are designed including very simple AI and 3D animation from code:</p>

You could mean the object itself, with just its members, the Object and all objects it refers to (the reference graph). You could mean the size in memory or the size on disk.

<p>So the only correct way is to ask the JVM, which a good profiler (I use <a href=""http://www.yourkit.com"">YourKit</a>), which probably isn't what you want.</p>

<p>However, from the description above it sounds like each row will be self-contained, and not have a big dependency tree, so the serialization method will probably be a good approximation on most JVMs. The easiest way to do this is as follows:</p>

<pre><code> Serializable ser;
 ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
 ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(baos);
 oos.writeObject(ser);
 oos.close();
 return baos.size();

<p>Change it to:</p>

<pre>
public class LoggingConnectionPool extends ConnectionPool{
    public OracleConnection getConnection(String datasourceName, String module, String action){
    	OracleConnection conn=getConnection(datasourceName);
    	CallableStatement call=conn.preparedCall(""begin dbms_application_info.setModule(module_name => ?, action_name => ?); end;"");
    	try{
    		call.setString(1,module);
    		call.setString(2,action);
    		call.execute();
    	finally{
    		call.close();
    	}
    	return new WrappedOracleConnection(conn);
    }
</pre>

<p>Note the use of WrappedOracleConnection above. You need this because you need to trap the close call</p>

<pre>
public class WrappedOracleConnection extends OracleConnection{
    public void close(){
    	CallableStatement call=this.preparedCall(""begin dbms_application_info.setModule(module_name => ?, action_name => ?); end;"");
    	try{
    		call.setNull(1,Types.VARCHAR);
    		call.setNull(2,Types.VARCHAR);
    		call.execute();
    	finally{
    		call.close();
    	}
    }

    // and you need to implement every other method
    //for example
    public CallableStatement prepareCall(String command){
    	return super.prepareCall(command);
    }
    ...
}
</pre>

<p>Then once they have demonstrated their algorithmic knowledge you can move on to the Java questions. Since some people work better in front of a computer than in front of the whiteboard, I would give them something simple, but leveraging their knowledge of Java, that they can implement in 30 minutes or so in using the same IDE that you are using at the company. This way if they claim to know the IDE you can also get an idea of how well they know it.</p>

But closures are desirable as a feature because they greatly simplify the code and increase readability and as a consequence the maintainability of the code.</p>

<p>I'm no Java specialist but I'm using  C# 3.5 and closures are one of my favorite features of the language, for example take the following statement as an example:</p>

<pre><code>// Example #1 with closures
public IList&lt;Customer&gt; GetFilteredCustomerList(string filter) {
    //Here a closure is created around the filter parameter
    return Customers.Where( c =&gt; c.Name.Contains(filter)).ToList();
}
</code></pre>

<p>now take an equivalent example that doesn't use closures</p>

<pre><code>//Example #2 without closures, using just basic OO techniques
public IList&lt;Customer&gt; GetFilteredCustomerList(string filter) {
    return new Customers.Where( new CustomerNameFiltrator(filter));
}
... 
public class CustomerNameFiltrator : IFilter&lt;Customer&gt; {
    private string _filter;
    public  CustomerNameFiltrator(string filter) {
         _filter = filter;
    }
    public bool Filter(Customer customer) {
        return customer.Name.Contains( _filter);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I know this is C# and not Java but the idea is the same, closures are useful for conciseness, and make code shorter and more readable. Behind the scenes, the closures of C# 3.5 do something that's looks very similar to example #2 meaning the compiler creates a private class behind the scenes and passes the 'filter' parameter to it.</p>

<p>Java doesn't need closures to work, as a developer you don't need them either, but, they are useful and provide benefits so that means that they are desirable in a language that is a production language and one of it's goals is productivity.</p>

Properties props = new Properties();

Properties tmp = new Properties() {

  public Set&lt;Object&gt; keySet()

<p>Here are the caveats:</p>

<ul>
<li>The tmp Properties (an anonymous
subclass) doesn't fulfill the
contract of Properties.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if you got its <code>keySet</code> and tried to remove an element from it, an exception would be raised. So, don't allow instances of this subclass to escape! In the snippet above, you are never passing it to another object or returning it to a caller who has a legitimate expectation that it fulfills the contract of Properties, so it is safe.</p>

<ul>
<li>The implementation of
Properties.storeToXML could change,
causing it to ignore the keySet
method.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, a future release, or OpenJDK, could use the <code>keys()</code> method of <code>Hashtable</code> instead of <code>keySet</code>. This is one of the reasons why classes should always document their ""self-use"" (Effective Java Item 15). However, in this case, the worst that would happen is that your output would revert to unsorted.</p>

methods ignore any ""default""
entries.</li>

(An instance of own app does that for 10-1000MB FLVs and MP4s.)  E.g.: No partial requests (byte range header), though.  One has to handle that 'manually', occasional down time, etc..</p>

<p>If that is not an option, John's code looks good.  I have found that a byte buffer of 2k FILEBUFFERSIZE is the most efficient in microbench marks.  Another option might be a shared FileChannel.  (FileChannels are thread-safe.)</p>

<p>That said, I'd also add that guessing at what caused an out of memory error is a classic optimization mistake.  You would improve your chances of success by working with hard metrics.</p>

<ol>
<li>Place -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError into you JVM startup parameters, just in case</li>
<li>take use jmap on the running JVM (<strong>jmap -histo &lt;pid&gt;</strong>) under load</li>
<li>Analyize the metrics (jmap -histo out put, or have jhat look at your heap dump).  It very well may be that your out of memory is coming from somewhere unexpected.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are of course other tools out there, but  jmap &amp; jhat come with Java 5+ 'out of the box'</p>

  <p>I've considered writing the file to a local temp drive and then spawning another thread to handle the streaming so that the tomcat servlet thread can be re-used. This seems like it would be io heavy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah, I don't think you can't do that.  And even if you could, it sounds dubious.  The tomcat thread that is managing the connection needs to in control.  If you are experiencing thread starvation  then increase the number of available threads in ./conf/server.xml.  Again, metrics are the way to detect this--don't just guess.  </p>

<p>I do agree with toby, you should instead ""point them to the S3 url.""</p>

<p>As for the OOM exception, are you sure it has to do with serving the image data?  Let's say your JVM has 256MB of ""extra"" memory to use for serving image data.  With Google's help, ""256MB / 200KB"" = 1310.  For 2GB ""extra"" memory (these days a very reasonable amount) over 10,000 simultaneous clients could be supported.  Even so, 1300 simultaneous clients is a pretty large number.  Is this the type of load you experienced?  If not, you may need to look elsewhere for the cause of the OOM exception.</p>

<p>Edit - Regarding:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this use case the images can contain sensitive data...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I read through the S3 documentation a few weeks ago, I noticed that you can generate time-expiring keys that can be attached to S3 URLs.  So, you would not have to open up the files on S3 to the public.  My understanding of the technique is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Initial HTML page has download links to your webapp</li>
<li>User clicks on a download link</li>
<li>Your webapp generates an S3 URL that includes a key that expires in, lets say, 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Send an HTTP redirect to the client with the URL from step 3.</li>
<li>The user downloads the file from S3.  This works even if the download takes more than 5 minutes - once a download starts it can continue through completion.</li>
</ol>

<p>1/ I will try using the S3 url instead, that is what I did when I encountered the problem last time. In that case I was serving flash (swf) files which were static files in a war. In this use case the images can contain sensitive data so I can't change the S3 ACL to public or others could read them. I guess I could temporarily change the ACL to public read for the duration of the read but that's a bit of a hack. I wonder if there's a way to authenticate a browser to S3 without having an AWS account - that would be the only way to do this properly. I'll have the solve this to be secure enough for a business to use it so any ideas are welcome although it might warrant a second question/thread.</p>

<p>2/ The 2k &amp; 8k suggestions are great - I was arbitrarily using 1k</p>

<p>3/ My hang/OOM error last time was probably due to too many threads trying to complete a stream and then running out of threads and memory. I am reading from the S3 io stream and writing direct to the response output stream (i.e. not loading into memory) but I will try the flushing suggestion as well.</p>

<p>4/ I am using EC2 as my server so reading from S3 is super fast - its got to be a response stream issue if anything. If the client has low bandwidth, does the servlet read/write loop get stalled or does it write to some tomcat buffer? I have Apache in front of tomcat (for fast SSL and ""budget"" load balancing) so I guess it could buffer there too although my OOM was definitely a java hang - apache was fine.</p>

<p>In terms of scaling &amp; speed it actually seems to be better than struts, and my guess would be because there are less layers involved. The code you end up with is a lot cleaner as well, because you don't have to go off to seperate XML files to find out where redirects are going.</p>

Instead, if your application logic works on a 2-D matrix of data, fetching those via direct JDBC works better. Although Hibernate is written on top of JDBC, it has capabilities which might be non-trivial to implement in JDBC. For eg:</p>

<ol>
<li>Say, the user views a row in the UI and changes some of the values and you want to fire an update query for only those columns that did indeed change.</li>

<li>To avoid getting into deadlocks you need to maintain a global order for SQLs in a transaction. Getting this right JDBC might not be easy</li>

<li>Easily setting up optimistic locking. When you use JDBC, you need to remember to have this in every update query.</li>

<li>Batch updates, lazy materialization of collections etc might also be non-trivial to implement in JDBC.</li> 
</ol>

<p>(I say ""<i>might</i> be non-trivial"", because it of course can be done - and you might be a super hacker:)</p>

<p>Hibernate lets you fire your own SQL queries also, in case you need to. </p>

<p>Hope this helps you to decide.</p>

<p>PS: Keeping the Session open on a remote desktop client and running into trouble is really not Hibernate's problem - you would run into the same issue if you keep the Connection to the DB open for long.</p>

  <p>Hello,</p>
  
  <p>Responding to your question seems
  fraught with peril by starting a flame
  war, so I'll proceed cautiously.</p>
  
  <p>There are a number of fundamental
  technical similarities between the
  Java Runtime and the Common Language
  Runtime, including garbage collected
  memory, an intermediate language
  (Microsoft IL versus Java ByteCode),
  core system libraries, and support for
  fairly high level languages, code
  security, and deployment.</p>
  
  <p>However, each of these 'similar' areas
  also have a number of sizable and
  small differences, and it's beyond the
  scope of a simple Forum post to
  describe most of them.</p>
  
  <p>I would suggest asking a more
  targetted question about any of the
  various runtime features and component
  areas (e.g. memory management,
  compilation, system libraries,
  security, etc.) and then we can
  provide a more targetted response
  (e.g. a blog, a technical article, or
  some books).</p>

The plugin for that is called 'GWT4NB', it's free and it will set up your ant script in such a way that you just have to right-click on your web project and choose debug.

Beaten to the punch by a Google search.  Unfortunately it's true there is no easy way to create draggable tab panes (or any other components) in Swing.  So whilst the example above is complete this one I've just written is a bit simpler. So it will hopefully demonstrate the more advanced techniques involved a bit clearer.  The steps are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Detect that a drag has occurred</li>
<li>Draw the dragged tab to an offscreen buffer</li>
<li>Track the mouse position whilst dragging occurs</li>
<li>Draw the tab in the buffer on top of the component.</li>
</ol>

<p>The above example will give you what you want but if you want to really understand the techniques applied here it might be a better exercise to round off the edges of this example and add the extra features demonstrated above to it.</p>

There are some details I added. For example, the ghost tab now slides along the tabbed pane instead of moving together with the mouse.</p>

<p><code>setAcceptor(TabAcceptor a_acceptor)</code> should let the consumer code decide whether to let one tab transfer from one tabbed pane to another. The default acceptor always returns <code>true</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why should I use VTD-XML for large XML files?</p>
  
  <p>For numerous reasons summarized below:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Performance: The performance of VTD-XML is far better than SAX</li>
  <li>Ease to use: Random access combined with XPath makes application easy to write</li>
  <li>Better maintainability: App code is shorter and simpler to understand.</li>
  <li>Incremental update: Occasional, small changes become very efficient.</li>
  <li>Indexing: Pre-parsed form of XML will further boost processing performance.</li>
  <li>Other features: Cut, paste, split and assemble XML documents is only possible with VTD-XML.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>In order to take advantage of VTD-XML, we recommended that developers split their ultra large XML documents into smaller, more manageable  chucks (&lt;2GB). </p>

</blockquote>

<p>These are built-in classes supported in MIDP 1.0 and higher. Also your code snippet will never work. Such an API would need to block the calling thread awaiting for the user to select and answer. This goes exactly in the opposite direction of the UI interaction model of MIDP, which is based in callbacks and delegation. You need to provide your own class, implementing <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/apis/jsr118/javax/microedition/lcdui/CommandListener.html"" rel=""nofollow"">CommandListener</a>, and prepare your code for asynchronous execution.</p>

<p>Here is an (untested!) example class based on Alert:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyPrompter implements CommandListener {

	private Alert yesNoAlert;

	private Command softKey1;
	private Command softKey2;

	private boolean status;

	public MyPrompter() {
		yesNoAlert = new Alert(""Attention"");
		yesNoAlert.setString(""Are you sure?"");
		softKey1 = new Command(""No"", Command.BACK, 1);
		softKey2 = new Command(""Yes"", Command.OK, 1);
		yesNoAlert.addCommand(softKey1);
		yesNoAlert.addCommand(softKey2);
		yesNoAlert.setCommandListener(this);
		status = false;
	}

	public Displayable getDisplayable() {
		return yesNoAlert;
	}

	public boolean getStatus() {
		return status;
	}

	public void commandAction(Command c, Displayable d) {
		status = c.getCommandType() == Command.OK;
		// maybe do other stuff here. remember this is asynchronous
	}

};
</code></pre>

<p>To use it (again, untested and on top of my head):</p>

<pre><code>MyPrompter prompt = new MyPrompter();
Display.getDisplay(YOUR_MIDLET_INSTANCE).setCurrent(prompt.getDisplayable());
</code></pre>

<p>This code will make the prompt the current displayed form in your app, but it <em>won't block your thread</em> like in the example you posted. You need to continue running and wait for a commandAction invocation.</p>

<pre><code>class C {{println 'hi'}}
new C()
</code></pre>

<p>... </p>

<pre><code>new C()
</code></pre>

<p>However methods become bound to the class that declared them, and GroovyShell creates a new class for each instance.  If you do not need the return value of any of the scripts and they are truly scripts (not classes with main methods) you can attach the following to the end of every evaluated scrips.</p>

<pre><code>Class klass = this.getClass()
this.getMetaClass().getMethods().each {
  if (it.declaringClass.cachedClass == klass) {
    binding[it.name] = this.&amp;""$it.name""
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you depend on the return value you can hand-manage the evaluation and run the script as part of your parsing (warning, untested code follows, for illustrative uses only)...</p>

<pre><code>String scriptText = ...
Script script = shell.parse(scriptText)
def returnValue = script.run()
Class klass = script.getClass()
script.getMetaClass().getMethods().each {
  if (it.declaringClass.cachedClass == klass) {
    shell.context[it.name] = this.&amp;""$it.name""
  }
}
// do whatever with returnValue...
</code></pre>

<p>There is one last caveat I am sure you are aware of.  Statically typed variables are not kept between evals as they are not stored in the binding.  So in the previous script the variable 'klass' will not be kept between script invocations and will disappear.  To rectify that simply remove the type declarations on the first use of all variables, that means they will be read and written to the binding.</p>

Higher order functions are functions having 'function objects' as parameters.</p>

<p>E.g. it is a very common operation to apply some transformation to every element in a list. This higher order function is commonly called 'map' or 'collect'. (See the *. spread operator of <a href=""http://groovy.codehaus.org/Operators"">Groovy</a>).</p>

<p>For example to square each element in a list without closures you would probably write:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; squareInts(List&lt;Integer&gt; is){
   List&lt;Integer&gt; result = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(is.size());
   for (Integer i:is)
      result.add(i*i);
   return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Using closures and map and the proposed syntax, you could write it like that:</p>

<pre><code>is.map({Integer i =&gt; i*i})
</code></pre>

<p>(There is a possible performance problem here regarding boxing of primitive types.)</p>

<p>As explained by Pop Catalin there is another higher order function called 'select' or 'filter': It can be used to get all the elements in a list complying to some condition. For example:</p>

<p>Instead of:</p>

<pre><code>void onlyStringsWithMoreThan4Chars(List&lt;String&gt; strings){
   List&lt;String&gt; result = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(str.size()); // should be enough
   for (String str:strings)
      if (str.length() &gt; 4) result.add(str);
   return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Instead you could write something like</p>

<pre><code>strings.select({String str =&gt; str.length() &gt; 4});
</code></pre>

<p>using the proposal.</p>

<p>You might look at the Groovy syntax, which is an extension of the Java language to support closures right now. See the chapter on collections of the <a href=""http://groovy.codehaus.org/Collections"">Groovy User Guide</a> for more examples what to do with closures.</p>

<p>A remark:</p>

<p>There is perhaps some clarification needed regarding the term 'closure'. What I've shown above are strictly spoken no closures. They are just 'function objects'. 
A closure is everything which can capture - or 'close over' - the (lexical) context of the code surrounding it. In that sense there are closures in Java right now, i.e. anonymous classes:</p>

<pre><code>Runnable createStringPrintingRunnable(final String str){
    return new Runnable(){
       public void run(){
          System.out.println(str); // this accesses a variable from an outer scope
       }

<p>-Java (from within or external to the database)</p>

<p>You can create a ""scheduled agent"" within the database (using LotusScript or Java) that can locate documents created since it last ran, locate the attachments, and extract them.

<p>External to the database, you can use any API except LotusScript to log-in to the server/mail database, and follow a similar process, e.g. extracting the files locally on a client or separate server.

<p>Consult the Domino Designer help (or IBM's website for C API) for more information.</p>

<p>As to a ""generic way"" to do this, if you are accessing data in Notes and needing to extract attachments, I believe these APIs are your best option.

<p>.NET clients interact with Java web services pretty well, though there are some gotchas. The best two technologies available for you for the .NET client are Microsoft Web Service Enhancements (WSE) and Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). WSE is an older technology that is no longer being updated by Microsoft, but still works great in Visual Studio 2005 and older. I find WSE to be a bit easier to get started with in terms of how you interface with basic services, but WCF has much more support for WS-* protocols (security, trust, etc.). If your needs are basic and you're still using Visual Studio 2005 (.NET framework 2 or older), then go with WSE. If you like the cutting edge, or you anticipate more advanced security needs (doesn't sound like you will), then go with WCF. Please note that WSE will not work easily in Visual Studio 2008 and newer, and WCF will not work in Visual Studio 2005 and older.</p>

<p>Going the web service route will mean that you will design to an interface that can be reused and will result in a more loosely coupled system when you're done than most of the other routes. The downside is primarily performance: xml serialization will be slower than binary over the wire, and web services do not handle large amounts of data well.</p>

<p>I agree with jhkiley that passing Node objects to the Edge constructor (instead of Strings) sounds like a good idea.</p>

The rules and conventions for naming your variables can be summarized as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Variable names are case-sensitive. A variable's name can be any legal identifier — an unlimited-length sequence of Unicode letters and digits, beginning with a letter, the dollar sign ""$"", or the underscore character ""_"". The convention, however, is to always begin your variable names with a letter, not ""$"" or ""_"". Additionally, the dollar sign character, by convention, is never used at all. You may find some situations where auto-generated names will contain the dollar sign, but your variable names should always avoid using it. A similar convention exists for the underscore character; while it's technically legal to begin your variable's name with ""_"", this practice is discouraged. White space is not permitted.</p></li>
<li><p>Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscore characters. Conventions (and common sense) apply to this rule as well. When choosing a name for your variables, use full words instead of cryptic abbreviations. Doing so will make your code easier to read and understand. In many cases it will also make your code self-documenting; fields named cadence, speed, and gear, for example, are much more intuitive than abbreviated versions, such as s, c, and g. Also keep in mind that the name you choose must not be a keyword or reserved word.</p></li>
<li><p>If the name you choose consists of only one word, spell that word in all lowercase letters. If it consists of more than one word, capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word. The names gearRatio and currentGear are prime examples of this convention. If your variable stores a constant value, such as <code>static final int NUM_GEARS = 6</code>, the convention changes slightly, capitalizing every letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore character. By convention, the underscore character is never used elsewhere. </p></li>

<pre><code>string myString="""";

{
    myString += ""x"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>will act as below (each step being the next loop iteration):</p>

<ol>
<li>construct a string object of length 1, and value ""x""</li>
<li>Create a new string object of size 2, copy the old string ""x"" into it, add ""x"" in position 2.</li>
<li>Create a new string object of size 3, copy the old string ""xx"" into it, add ""x"" in position 3.</li>
<li>... and so on</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see, each iteration is having to copy one more character, resulting in us performing 1+2+3+4+5+...+N operations each loop.  This is an O(n^2) operation. If however we knew in advance that we only needed N characters, we could do it in a single allocation, with copy of just N characters from the strings we were using - a mere O(n) operation.</p>

<p>StringBuffer/StringBuilder avoid this because they are mutable, and so do not need to keep copying the same data over and over (so long as there is space to copy into in their internal buffer).  They avoid performing an allocation and copy proportional to the number of appends done by over-allocing their buffer by a proportion of its current size, giving amortized O(1) appending.</p>

<p>However its worth noting that often the compiler will be able to optimise code into StringBuilder style (or better - since it can perform constant folding etc.) automatically.</p>

<p>The wsdl for the service included a line</p>

<pre><code>&lt;import namespace=""http://mynamespace.company.com""/&gt;

<p>The soap that the client sent to the server had the following attribute on all data elements:</p>

<pre><code>xmlns=""http://mynamespace.company.com""

<p>But the xml payload of the response (from the service back to the client) did <em>not</em> have this namespace included.  By tinkering with the HTTP response (which I obtained with <strong>WireShark</strong>), I observed that the .NET proxy class correctly picked up the MyResponse values if I forced the xmlns attribute on every returned data element.</p>

<p>Short of changing the service, which I don't control, the workaround is to edit the VS generated proxy class (eg Reference.cs) and look for lines like this:</p>

<pre><code>[System.Xml.Serialization.XmlTypeAttribute(Namespace=""http://mynamespace.company.com"")]
public partial class MyResponse {
</code></pre>

<p>and comment out the XmlType attribute line.  This will tell the CLR to look for response elements in the default namespace rather than the one specied in the wsdl.  You have to redo this whenever you update the reference, but at least it works.</p>

<li>Many C# and C++ programmers adopt the convention of placing 'I' in front of interfaces (aka pure virtual classes in C++). This is not required, and hence not done, in Java because the implements keyword makes it very clear when something is an interface.</li>

<p>Try to distribute your library as a DLL rather than a static library. This gives way better compatibility between different c compilers and linkers. Another problem with static libraries in visual c++ is that the choice of runtime library can make libraries incompatible with code using a different runtime library and you may end up needing to distribute one version of the library for each runtime library.</p>

<p>Avoid c++ if possible. The c++ name mangling differs alot between different compilers and it's unlikely that a library built for visual c++ will be possible to link from another build environment in windows. When it comes to C, things are much better, in particular if you use dll's.</p>

<p>If you really want to get the good parts of c++ (such as resource management through constructors and destructors), build a convenience layer in c++ that you distribute as source code that hides away your c functions. Since the user has the source and compiles it locally, it won't have any name mangiling or abi issues with the local environment.</p>

In fact, if you can, I would make Node and Edge completely immutable, which has <a href=""http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=29"" rel=""nofollow"">many benefits</a>.</p>

<p>So, for example:</p>

<pre><code>public final class Node {

    private final String name;

    public Node(String name) {
           this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() { return name; }
    // note: no setter for name
}
</code></pre>

<p>You would then do your uniqueness check in the Graph object:</p>

<pre><code>public class Graph {
    Set&lt;Node&gt; nodes = new HashSet&lt;Node&gt;();
    public void addNode(Node n) {
        // note: this assumes you've properly overridden 
        // equals and hashCode in Node to make Nodes with the 
        // same name .equal() and hash to the same value.
        if(nodes.contains(n)) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Already in graph: "" + node);
        }
        nodes.add(n);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to modify a name of a node, remove the old node and add a new one. This might sound like extra work, but it saves a lot of effort keeping everything straight.</p>

<p>Really, though, creating your own Graph structure from the ground up is probably unnecessary -- this issue is only the first of many you are likely to run into if you build your own.</p>

<p>I would recommend finding a good open source Java graph library, and using that instead. Depending on what you are doing, there are a few options out there. I have used <a href=""http://jung.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">JUNG</a> in the past, and would recommend it as a good starting point.</p>

<p>1) Extend List class - and add the join method to it.  The join method would simply do the work of concatenating and adding the delimiter (which could be a param to the join method)</p>

<p>2) It looks like Java 7 is going to be adding extension methods to java - which allows you just to attach a specific method on to a class:  so you could write that join method and add it as an extension method to List or even to Collection.</p>

<p>Solution 1 is probably the only realistic one, now, though since Java 7 isn't out yet :) But it should work just fine.</p>

@XmlRootElement(name = ""blah"")
public class Blah implements Serializable {
    private Integer id;
    private String text;

    public void setId(Integer id) { this.id = id; }

    @XmlElement
    public String getText() { return text; }
    public void setText(String value) { this.text = value; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then create a Resource </p>

<pre><code>@Path(""/blah"")
public class BlahResource {
    private Set&lt;Blah&gt; blahs = new HashSet&lt;Blah&gt;();

    @Context
    private UriInfo context;

    public BlahResource() {
        blahs.add(new Blah(1, ""blah the first""));
        blahs.add(new Blah(2, ""blah the second""));

    @GET
    @Path(""/{id}"")
    @ProduceMime({""application/json"", ""application/xml""})
    public Blah getBlah(@PathParam(""id"") Integer id) {
        for (Blah blah : blahs) {
            if (blah.getId().equals(id)) {
                return blah;
            }
        }
        throw new NotFoundException(""not found"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and expose it. There are many ways to do this, such as by using Jersey's ServletContainer. (web.xml)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;servlet&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;jersey&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;servlet-class&gt;com.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet.ServletContainer&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
    &lt;load-on-startup&gt;1&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;

&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;jersey&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Thats all you need to do... pop open your browser and browse to <a href=""http://localhost/blah/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost/blah/1</a>. By default you will see XML output. If you are using FireFox, install TamperData and change your <code>accept</code> header to <code>application/json</code> to see the JSON output.</p>

<ol>
<li>Use JNI and crash in the native code.</li>
<li>If no security manager is installed you can use reflection to crash the VM. This is VM specific, but normally a VM stores a bunch of pointers to native resources in private fields (e.g. a pointer to the native thread object is stored in a long field in <strong>java.lang.Thread</strong>). Just change them via reflection and the VM will crash sooner or later.</li>
<li>All VMs have bugs, so you just have to trigger one.</li>

<p>JVMs (the native code) can have bugs. For example JITed (generated) code, native methods or system calls (graphics driver) can have problems leading to real crashes.

<p>On Linux/Unix you can easyly make a JVM crash by sending it a Signal to the running process.

<p>The Java Spec says that everything in Java is pass-by-value. There is no such thing as ""pass-by-reference"" in Java.</p>

<p>The key to understanding this is that something like</p>

<pre><code>Dog myDog;
</code></pre>

<p>is <em>not</em> a Dog; it's actually a <em>pointer</em> to a Dog.</p>

<p>What that means, is when you have</p>

<pre><code>Dog myDog = new Dog(""Rover"");
foo(myDog);
</code></pre>

<p>you're essentially passing the <em>address</em> of the created <code>Dog</code> object to the <code>foo</code> method.</p>

<p>(I say essentially b/c Java pointers aren't direct addresses, but it's easiest to think of them that way)</p>

<p>Suppose the <code>Dog</code> object resides at memory address 42. This means we pass 42 to the method.</p>

<p>if the Method were defined as</p>

<pre><code>public void foo(Dog someDog) {
    someDog.setName(""Max"");     // AAA
    someDog = new Dog(""Fifi"");  // BBB
    someDog.setName(""Rowlf"");   // CCC
}
</code></pre>

<p>let's look at what's happening.</p>

<ul>
<li>the parameter <code>someDog</code> is set to the value 42</li>
<li>at line ""AAA""
<ul>
<li><code>someDog</code> is followed to the <code>Dog</code> it points to (the <code>Dog</code> object at address 42)</li>
<li>that <code>Dog</code> (the one at address 42) is asked to change his name to Max</li>
</ul></li>
<li>at line ""BBB""
<ul>
<li>a new <code>Dog</code> is created. Let's say he's at address 74</li>
<li>we assign the parameter <code>someDog</code> to 74 </li>
</ul></li>
<li>at line ""CCC""
<ul>
<li>someDog is followed to the <code>Dog</code> it points to (the <code>Dog</code> object at address 74)</li>
<li>that <code>Dog</code> (the one at address 74) is asked to change his name to Rowlf</li>
</ul></li>
<li>then, we return</li>
</ul>

<p>Now let's think about what happens outside the method:</p>

<p><em>Did <code>myDog</code> change?</em></p>

<p>There's the key.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind that <code>myDog</code> is a <em>pointer</em>, and not an actual <code>Dog</code>, the answer is NO. <code>myDog</code> still has the value 42; it's still pointing to the original <code>Dog</code>.</p>

<p>It's perfectly valid to <em>follow</em> an address and change what's at the end of it; that does not change the variable, however.</p>

<p>Java works exactly like C. You can assign a pointer, pass the pointer to a method, follow the pointer in the method and change the data that was pointed to. However, you cannot change where that pointer points.</p>

<p>In C++, Ada, Pascal and other languages that support pass-by-reference, you can actually change the variable that was passed.</p>

<p>If Java had pass-by-reference semantics, the <code>foo</code> method we defined above would have changed where <code>myDog</code> was pointing when it assigned <code>someDog</code> on line BBB.</p>

<p>Think of reference parameters as being aliases for the variable passed in. When that alias is assigned, so is the variable that was passed in.</p>

<p>Does that help? (I'll have to add this as an addendum to my article...)<br>

<p>A warning about gSOAP linking though: you can never use more than one WSDL in a single link object (executable, dll, shared object).  This is because some of the generated WSDL-specific functions have general names (e.g. soap_getfault()).</p>

<p>Worse, with Unix ELF linking, these names will cause cross-linking between shared objects, so a FooService fault might be processed by the soap_getfault() for BarService, corrupting memory if the fault detail structures are different.</p>

<p>The workaround for that is to make sure that nothing gSOAP-related is exposed outside the SO they are linked into.  This can be solved by giving gcc these definitions _both when linking the gSOAP library itself and linking your code:</p>

<pre><code>#define SOAP_FMAC2  __attribute__ ((visibility (""hidden"")))
#define SOAP_FMAC4  __attribute__ ((visibility (""hidden"")))
#define SOAP_FMAC6  __attribute__ ((visibility (""hidden"")))
#define SOAP_NMAC   __attribute__ ((visibility (""hidden"")))

<p>I solved it by putting them into a header file and forcing gcc to include that before anything else with <code>-include fixsoaplink.h</code>.</p>

<p>A better way if you can take the effort might to change the default ELF visibility to hidden, and only export the symbols you want to (like dllimport/dllexport in VC).</p>

<p>The problem with Motorola's tools is that I always seemed to spend way too much time trying to figure out how to work around them.

<p>It worked perfectly first time.</p>

<p>I turned on debugging on the FTP server (Debian's default ftpd). WebMethods' NLST honours the active/passive parameter passed to it.</p>

<p>There's nothing special about the NLST command, nor its correct behaviour with an empty directory -- if LIST works, then so should RETR, STOR and NLST. If NLST works with a non-empty directory, it should work with an empty one.</p>

<p>So my guess is that either:</p>

<li>Your version of WM has a bug mine doesn't</li>
<li>Your FTP server has a bug mine doesn't</li>
<li>There's a wacky protocol-aware firewall in your system that doesn't like FTP data sockets with no data in them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Firewall vendors are a bit wayward when it comes to FTP...
When testing with other clients, make sure it's from the same machine on which WebMethods Integration Server is running.</p>

<p>Just for the record, here's what should happen for an active NLST</p>

<ul>
<li>client opens a listening socket, and sends a PORT command with that socket's details</li>
<li>client sends NLST command</li>
<li>server connects to client's listening socket (this is the data socket)</li>
<li>server transmits listing over data socket (in this case, zero bytes)</li>
<li>server closes data socket</li>

<p>... and in passive mode</p>

<ul>
<li>client sends PASV command</li>
<li>server opens a listening socket, and replies with PASV response containing its details</li>
<li>client connects to listening socket (this is the data socket)</li>
<li>client sends NLST command</li>
<li>server transmits listing over data socket (zero bytes again)</li>

So it would be possible to have Java and C++ sessions participating in the same transaction without needing any sort of additional coordinator.  </p>

<p>Alternately, you might consider using Workspace Manager.  That was originally designed to support extremely long-running transactions (i.e. manipulating lots of spatial data for a proposed development).  Essentially, you can create a workspace, which in your case would be roughly equivalent to a named transaction.  Both the Java and C++ code could enter that workspace (from separate sessions) and both could manipulate and commit data in that workspace.  When the transaction was complete, you could then merge the workspace to the LIVE workspace, which is equivalent to doing a commit in a normal transaction.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I would strongly agree with your initial assessment that coordinating transactions between processes is very likely to be a bad idea from a performance, stability, simplicity, and maintenance standpoint.

<a href=""http://www.xquery.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xquery.com</a></p>

<p>XQuery is a query language that was designed as a native XML query language. Because most types of data can be represented as XML, XQuery can also be used to query other types of data. For example, XQuery can be used to query relational data using an XML view of a relational database. This is important because many Internet applications need to integrate information from multiple sources, including data found in web messages, relational data, and various XML sources. XQuery was specifically designed for this kind of data integration.</p>

<p>For example, suppose your company is a financial institution that needs to produce reports of stock holdings for each client. A client requests a report with a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) message, which is represented in XML. In most businesses, the stock holdings data is stored in multiple relational databases, such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, or DB2. XQuery can query both the SOAP message and the relational databases, creating a report in XML.</p>

<p>XQuery is based on the structure of XML and leverages that structure to make it possible to perform queries on any type of data that can be represented as XML, including relational data. In addition, XQuery API for Java (XQJ) lets your queries run in any environment that supports the J2EE platform.</p>

<p>This rather silly loop goes through a sequence (using forward iterator semantics only), printing each contiguous subsequence of 3 elements exactly once (and a couple shorter subsequences at the end).  But supposing N elements, and M elements per line instead of 3, this algorithm would still be O(N*M) iterator increments, and O(1) space.</p>

<p>The Java style iterators lack the ability to store position independently.  You will either</p>

<ul>
<li>lose O(1) space, using (for example) an array of size M to store history as you iterate</li>
<li>will need to traverse the list N times, making O(N^2+N*M) time</li>
<li>or use a concrete Array type with GetAt member function, losing genericism and the ability to use linked list container types.</li>
</ul>

<p>The schemes that rely on serialization (XML or otherwise) are kludgy.</p>

<p>There is no easy answer here. If you want to deep copy an object you will have to traverse the object graph and copy each child object explicitly via the object's copy constructor or a static factory method that in turn deep copies the child object. Immutables (e.g. Strings) do not need to be copied. As an aside, you should favor immutability for this reason.</p>

<p>Strings are immutable types. You cannot modify them, only return new string instances.</p>

<p>Because of that, ""foo"".format() makes little sense, as it would have to be called like</p>

<pre><code>string newString = ""foo"".format();
</code></pre>

<p>The original java authors (and .NET authors), decided that a static method made more sense in this situation, as you are not modifying ""foo"", but instead calling a format method and passing in an input string.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Heh, this site can be so amusing sometimes. I got downvoted for mentioning the fact that strings are immutable types.</p>

<p>Here is an example of why Format() would be dumb as an instance method. In .NET (and probably in Java), Replace() is an instance method.</p>

<p>You can do this:</p>

<pre><code> ""I Like Wine"".Replace(""Wine"",""Beer"");
</code></pre>

<p>However, nothing happens, because Strings are immutable. Replace tries to return a new string, but it is assigned to nothing.</p>

<p>This causes lots of common rookie mistakes like:</p>

<pre><code>// Contrived Example
inputText.Replace("" "",""%20"");
</code></pre>

<p>Again, nothing happens, instead you have to do :</p>

<pre><code>inputText = inputText.Replace("" "",""%20"");
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if you understand that strings are immutable, that makes perfect sense. If you don't, then you are just confused. The proper place for Replace, would be where Format is, as a static method of String:</p>

<pre><code> inputText = String.Replace(inputText,"" "", ""%20"");
</code></pre>

<p>Now there is no question as to whats going on.</p>

<p>The real question is, why did the authors of these frameworks decide that one should be an instance method, and the other static? In my opinion, both are more elegantly expressed as static methods, but erickson seems to think both belong as instance methods.</p>

<p>Regardless of your opinion, the truth is that you are less prone to make a mistake using the static version, and the code is easier to understand (No Hidden Gotchas).</p>

<p>Of course there are some methods that are perfect as instance methods, take String.Length()</p>

<pre><code>int length = ""123"".Length();
</code></pre>

<p>In this situation, its obvious we are not trying to modify ""123"", we just inspecting it, and returning its length...This is a perfect candidate for an instance method.</p>

<p>My simple rules for Instance Methods on Immutable Objects:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you need to return a new instance of the same type, use a static method.</li>
<li>Otherwise, use an instance method.</li>
</ul>

<p>Longer answer ensues:</p>

<p>Our solution to the callback problem had essentially three parts.  The first was the object wrapping which needed the ability to specify that it was being used for a client to server connection vs. being used for a server to client callback.  Using an extension of <code>UnicastRemoteObject</code> gave us the ability to specify the client and server socket factories that we wanted to use.  However, the best place to lock down the socket factories is in the constructor of the remote object.  </p>

<pre><code>public class RemoteObjectWrapped extends UnicastRemoteObject {
// ....
private RemoteObjectWrapped(final boolean callback) throws RemoteException {
  super((callback ? RemoteConnectionParameters.getCallbackPort() : RemoteConnectionParameters.getServerSidePort()),
        (callback ? CALLBACK_CLIENT_SOCKET_FACTORY : CLIENT_SOCKET_FACTORY),
        (callback ? CALLBACK_SERVER_SOCKET_FACTORY : SERVER_SOCKET_FACTORY));
}
// ....
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, the first argument specifies the part on which the object is expecting requests, whereas the second and third specify the socket factories that will be used at either end of the connection driving this remote object.</p>

<p>Since we wanted to restrict the ports used by the connection, we needed to extend the RMI socket factories and lock down the ports.  Here are some sketches of our server and client factories:</p>

<pre><code>public class SpecifiedServerSocketFactory implements RMIServerSocketFactory {
/** Always use this port when specified. */
private int serverPort;
/**
 * @param ignoredPort This port is ignored.  
 * @return a {@link ServerSocket} if we managed to create one on the correct port.
 * @throws java.io.IOException
 */
@Override
public ServerSocket createServerSocket(final int ignoredPort) throws IOException {
    try {
        final ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(this.serverPort);
        return serverSocket;
    } catch (IOException ioe) {
        throw new IOException(""Failed to open server socket on port "" + serverPort, ioe);
    }
}
// ....
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the server socket factory above ensures that only the port that you previously specified will ever be used by this factory.  The client socket factory has to be paired with the appropriate socket factory (or you'll never connect).</p>

<pre><code>public class SpecifiedClientSocketFactory implements RMIClientSocketFactory, Serializable {
/** Serialization hint */
public static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
/** This is the remote port to which we will always connect. */
private int remotePort;
/** Storing the host just for reference. */
private String remoteHost = ""HOST NOT YET SET"";
// ....
/**
 * @param host The host to which we are trying to connect
 * @param ignoredPort This port is ignored.  
 * @return A new Socket if we managed to create one to the host.
 * @throws java.io.IOException
 */
@Override
public Socket createSocket(final String host, final int ignoredPort) throws IOException {
    try {
        final Socket socket = new Socket(host, remotePort);
        this.remoteHost = host;
        return socket;
    } catch (IOException ioe) {
        throw new IOException(""Failed to open a socket back to host "" + host + "" on port "" + remotePort, ioe);
    }
}
// ....
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, the only thing remaining to force your two way connection to stay on the same set of ports is some logic to recognize that you are calling back to the client-side.  In that situation, just make sure that your factory method for the remote object calls the RemoteObjectWrapper constructor up top with the callback parameter set to true.</p>

The same story with NetBeans: somehow somewhere somewhat reads out xml config files and creates UI from that, cool, as long as you follow the tutorial. And of course you can't develop and Eclipse-based RCP using some other IDE, NB is also very jealous about its usage (unless you do some hacks like I did).
What I'm lacking is a clear way to debug my threads from main to action performed. Instead I'm always told what I have to do to avoid exceptions. And so I have to keep my fingers crossed each time I'm trying to pull something new. And it never works out the first time.
Now I thought about the features I need and I looked out for smaller projects that aim at specific functionality like plugin management eg. And there are plenty.

qb.from(""Image"", ""img"");
qb.join(""img.pixels"", ""pix"", true, false);

// Can't join anymore after this

There were several queries which the Criteria API could not perform (see <a href=""http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH-879"" rel=""nofollow"">HHH-879</a>), so in the end it was simpler to write this small class to wrap StringBuilder.

You implement the following interface for all actions <strong>to which</strong> you are likely to want to redirect:</p>

<pre><code>public interface TargetAware {
  public String getTarget();
  public void setTarget(String target);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The interceptor simply ensures that the target is set, if required:</p>

<pre><code>public class SetTargetInterceptor extends MethodFilterInterceptor implements Interceptor {
   public String doIntercept(ActionInvocation invocation) {
      Object action = invocation.getAction();
      HttpServletRequest request = (HttpServletRequest) invocation.getInvocationContext().get(StrutsStatics.HTTP_REQUEST);
      if (action instanceof TargetAware) {
         TargetAware targetAwareAction = (TargetAware) action;
         if (targetAwareAction.getTarget() == null)
            targetAwareAction.setTarget(getCurrentUri(request));
      } 	
      return invocation.invoke();
   }

   // I'm sure we can find a better implementation of this...
   private static String getCurrentUri(HttpServletRequest request) {
      String uri = request.getRequestURI();
      String queryString = request.getQueryString();
      if (queryString != null &amp;&amp; !queryString.equals(""""))
         uri += ""?"" + queryString;
      return uri;
   }

   public void init() { /* do nothing */ }
   public void destroy() { /* do nothing */ }
}
</code></pre>

<p>From then on, once these two bits are in place and your actions implement the <code>TargetAware</code> interface (if you expect to have to redirect to them), then you have access to a <code>target</code> parameter in your JSPs whenever you need it.  Pass that parameter on to your <code>VisualizationAction</code> (which might as well implement also the <code>TargetAware</code> interface!), and on <code>SUCCESS</code>, redirect as explained by Vincent Ramdhanie:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;action name=""Visual"" class=""it.___.web.actions.VisualizationAction""&gt;
   &lt;result type=""redirect""&gt;
      &lt;param name=""location""&gt;${target}&lt;/param&gt;
      &lt;param name=""parse""&gt;true&lt;/param&gt;
   &lt;/result&gt;
&lt;/action&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I did not try every single detail of this strategy.  In particular, beware of the notation surrounding the <code>redirect</code> result type (depending on your specific version of Struts2: 2.0.x and 2.1.x may differ on this...).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Performance. Java and .Net have similar performance level due to the virtual machine, but JVM normally has better performance because of years and years optimization.</p></li>
<li><p>Library. Although this depends on your task, Java has much more open source or third party libraries available there. For server App, J2EE, Spring, Struts, etc. For GUI, although .Net provides Win32 layer API but this causes compatibility issues. Java has Swing, SWT, AWT, etc. It works in most cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Compatibility. This is the key issues that need to be considered when develop the cross-platform program. Two issue: first, platform compatibility. Java still wins since JDK is well maintained by single and original company Sun. Mono is not maintained by MS, so you have no guarantee yet for update compatibility. 2. Backward compatibility. Sun maintains a good reputation on their backward compatibility, although sometimes this seems too rigid and slows the pace.</p></li>
<li><p>Tools. Java has good cross-platform IDEs. Netbeans, Eclipse, etc. Most of them are free. VS Studio is good but only on Windows, and not cost a bit. Both of them provides good unit tests, debugs, profiles, etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hence I'd suggest that Java is a better choice. As a show case, there are some famous desktop cross-platforms apps developed by Java: Vuze, Limewire, BlogBridge, CrossFTP, not to mention those IDEs. As to .Net, I have limited knowledge on such success apps.</p>

<p>Seems that nobody mentioned Ctrl-2 L (assign to new local variable) and Ctrl-2 F (assign to a new field), these ones have changed how I write code.</p>

<p>Previously, I was typing, say (| is cursor location):</p>

<pre><code>Display display = new |
</code></pre>

<p>and then I pushed Ctrl-Space to complete the constructor call. Now I type:</p>

<pre><code>new Display()|
</code></pre>

<p>and press Ctrl-2 L, which results in:</p>

<pre><code>Display display = new Display()|
</code></pre>

<p>This really speeds things up. (Ctrl-2 F does the same, but assigns to a new field rather than a new variable.)</p>

<p>Another good shortcut is Ctrl-2 R: rename in file. It is much faster than rename refactoring (Alt-Shift-R) when renaming things like local variables.</p>

<p>Actually I went to Keys customization preference page and assigned all sorts of additional quick fixes to Ctrl-2-something. For example I now press Ctrl-2 J to split/join variable declaration, Ctrl-2 C to extract an inner class into top-level, Ctrl-2 T to add throws declaration to the function, etc. There are tons of assignable quick fixes, go pick your favourite ones and assign them to Ctrl-2 shortcuts.</p>

<h1>Templates</h1>

<p>Another favourite of mine in my “npe” template, defined as:</p>

<pre><code>if (${arg:localVar} == null)
    throw new ${exception:link(NullPointerException,IllegalArgumentException)}(""${arg:localVar} is null"");
</code></pre>

<p>This allows me to quickly add null argument checks at the start of every function (especially ones that merely save the argument into a field or add it into a collection, especially constructors), which is great for detecting bugs early.</p>

<p>See more useful templates at <a href=""http://www.tarantsov.com/eclipse/templates/"" rel=""nofollow"">www.tarantsov.com/eclipse/templates/</a>. I won't list them all here because there are many, and because I often add new ones.</p>

<h1>Completion</h1>

<p>A few code completion tricks:</p>

<ul>
<li>camel case support mentioned in another answer: type cTM, get currentTimeMillis</li>
<li>default constructor: in the class declaration with no default constructor push Ctrl-Space, the first choice will be to create one</li>
<li>overloading: in the class declaration start typing name of a method you can overload, Ctrl-Space, pick one</li>
<li>getter/setter creation: type “get”, Ctrl-Space, choose a getter to create; same with “is” and “set”</li>
</ul>

<h1>Assign To A New Field</h1>

<p>This is how I add fields.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you have no constructors yet, add one. (Ctrl-Space anywhere in a class declaration, pick the first proposal.)</p></li>
<li><p>Add an argument (| is cursor position):</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass {
    public MyClass(int something|) {
    }
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Press Ctrl-1, choose “assign to a new field”. You get:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass {
    private final Object something;
    public MyClass(Object something) {
        this.something = something;
    }
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Add a null-pointer check if appropriate (see “npe” template above):</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass {
    private final Object something;
    public MyClass(Object something) {
        npe|
        this.something = something;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hit Ctrl-Space, get:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass {
    private final Object something;
    public MyClass(Object something) {
        if (something == null)
            throw new NullPointerException(""something is null"");
        this.something = something;
    }
}
</code></pre></li>

Just thought I'd add my answer which I also posted on my <a href=""http://blog.rungeek.com/post/81611917/how-to-use-sqlite-with-java"">blog</a>.</p>

<p>I have been coding in Java for a while now. I have also known about SQLite but never used it… Well I have used it through other <a href=""http://www.sqlite.org/famous.html"">applications</a> but never in an app that I coded. So I needed it for a project this week and it's so simple use!</p>

<p>First I found the website of <a href=""http://www.zentus.com/"">David Crawshaw</a> who has a <a href=""http://www.zentus.com/sqlitejdbc"">Java JDBC driver for SQLite</a>. Just add his <a href=""http://files.zentus.com/sqlitejdbc/sqlitejdbc-v056.jar"">JAR file</a> to your classpath and import java.sql.*</p>

<p>His test app will create a database file, send some SQL commands to create a table, store some data in the table, and read it back and display on console. It will create the <strong>test.db</strong> file in the root directory of the project.  You can run this example with <code>java -cp .:sqlitejdbc-v056.jar Test</code>.</p>

<pre><code>package com.rungeek.sqlite;

        stat.executeUpdate(""drop table if exists people;"");
        stat.executeUpdate(""create table people (name, occupation);"");

        prep.setString(1, ""Wittgenstein"");
        prep.setString(2, ""smartypants"");
        prep.addBatch();

        conn.setAutoCommit(false);
        prep.executeBatch();
        conn.setAutoCommit(true);

        while (rs.next()) {

<p>a) <strong>functions can be named or anonymous</strong>. But they can also be objects of themselves. This allows functions to be passed around as arguments, returned from functions or stored in data structures. This means that functions are first class objects in a programming language.</p>

<p>Anonymous functions don't add much to the language, they just allow you to write functions in a shorter way.</p>

<p>b) <strong>A closure is a function plus a binding environment</strong>. closures can be passed <em>downwards</em> (as parameters) or returned <em>upwards</em> (as return values). This allows the function to refer to variables of its environment, even if the surrounding code is no longer active.</p>

<p>If you have a) in some language, then the question comes up what to do about b)? There are languages that have a), but not b). In the functional programming world a (functions) and b (functions as closures) is nowadays the norm. Smalltalk had a) (<em>blocks</em> are anonymous functions) for a long time, but then some dialects of Smalltalk added support for b) (blocks as closures).</p>

<p>You can imagine that you get a slightly different programming model if you add functions and closures to the language. </p>

<p>From a pragmatic view the anonymous function adds some short notation where you pass or invoke functions. That can be a good thing.</p>

<p>The closure (function plus binding) allows you for example to create a function that has access to some variables (for example to a counter value). Now you can store that function in an object, access it and invoke it. The context for the function object is now not only the objects it has access to, but also the variables it has access to via bindings. This is also useful, but you can see that variable bindings vs. access to object variables now is an issue: when should be something a <em>lexical</em> variable (that can be accessed in a closure) and when should it be a variable of some object (a <code>slot</code>). When should something be a closure or an object? You can use both in the similar ways. A usual programming exercise for students learning Scheme (a Lisp dialect) is to write a simple object system using closures.</p>

<p>The result is a more complicated programming language and a more complicated runtime model. Too complicated?</p>

This means for primitive datatypes you will work with an copy and for objects you will work with an copy of the reference to the objects.

<pre><code>public static void swap(StringBuffer s1, StringBuffer s2) {
    StringBuffer temp = s1;
    s1 = s2;
    s2 = temp;
}


public static void main(String[] args) {

<p>This will populate Hello World and not World Hello because in the swap function you use copys which have no impact on the references in the main. But if your objects are not immutable you can change it for example:</p>

<pre><code>public static void appendWorld(StringBuffer s1) {
    s1.append("" World"");
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    StringBuffer s = new StringBuffer(""Hello"");
    appendWorld(s);
    System.out.println(s);

<p>This will populate Hello World on the command line. If you change StringBuffer into String it will produce just Hello because String is immutable. For example:</p>

<pre><code>public static void appendWorld(String s){
    s = s+"" World"";
}

public static void main(String[] args) {

<p>However you could make a wrapper for String like this which would make it able to use it with Strings:</p>

<pre><code>class StringWrapper {
    public String value;

    public StringWrapper(String value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
}

public static void appendWorld(StringWrapper s){
    s.value = s.value +"" World"";
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    StringWrapper s = new StringWrapper(""Hello"");
    appendWorld(s);
    System.out.println(s.value);
}
</code></pre>

<p>edit: i believe this is also the reason to use StringBuffer when it comes to ""adding"" two Strings because you can modifie the original object which u can't with immutable objects like String is.</p>

  <p>I've been reading a lot lately about the next release of Java possibly supporting closures. I feel like I have a pretty firm grasp on what closures are, but I can't think of a solid example of how they would make an Object-Oriented language ""better.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, most people who use the term ""closure"" actually mean ""function object"", and in this sense, function objects make it possible to write simpler code in certain circumstances such as when you need custom comparators in a sort function.  </p>

<p>For example, in Python:</p>

<pre><code>def reversecmp(x, y):
   return y - x

a = [4, 2, 5, 9, 11]
a.sort(cmp=reversecmp)
</code></pre>

<p>This sorts the list a in reverse order by passing the custom comparison functoin reversecmp.  The addition of the lambda operator makes things even more compact:</p>

<pre><code>a = [4, 2, 5, 9, 11]
a.sort(cmp=lambda x, y : y - x)
</code></pre>

<p>Java does not have function objects, so it uses ""functor classes"" to simulate them.  In Java you do the equivalent operation by implementing a custom version of the Comparator class, and passing that to the sort function:</p>

<pre><code>class ReverseComparator implements Comparator {
   public compare(Object x, Object y) {
      return (Integer) y - (Integer) x;
   }

...

List&lt;Integer&gt; a = Arrays.asList(4, 2, 5, 9, 11);
Collections.sort(a, new ReverseComparator());
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, it gives the same effect as closures, but is clumsier and more verbose.  However, the addition of anonymous inner classes obviates most of the pain:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; a = Arrays.asList(4, 2, 5, 9, 11);
Comparator reverse = new Comparator() {
   public Compare(Object x, Object y) {
       return (Integer) y - (Integer) x;
   }
}
Collections.sort(a, reverse);
</code></pre>

<p>So I would say that the combination of functor classes + anonymous inner classes in Java is sufficient to compensate for the lack of true function objects, making their addition unnecessary.</p>

<p>They <em>are</em> syntactic sugar in the same sense that Java is syntactic sugar for assembler (that ""assembler"" could be bytecode, for sake of argument). In other words they raise they level of abstraction, and this is an important concept.</p>

<p>Closures promote the concept of the function-as-object to a first class entity - one that increases the expressiveness of code, rather than cluttering it with even more boilerplate.</p>

<p>An example that's close to my heart has already been mentioned by Tom Hawtin - implementing the Execute Around idiom, which is just about the only way to get RAII into Java. <a href=""http://www.levelofindirection.com/journal/2009/9/24/raii-and-closures-in-java.html"" rel=""nofollow"">I wrote a blog entry on exactly that subject</a> a couple of years ago when I first heard closures might be coming.</p>

<p>Ironically, I think the very reason that closures would be good for Java (more expressiveness with less code) may be what rattles many Java advocates. Java has a mindset of ""spell everything out the long way"". That and the fact that closures are a nod towards a more functional way of doing things - which I also see as a Good Thing, but may water down the pure OO message that many in the Java community hold dear.</p>

    arg1 = 1;
    arg2 = 2;
}
void caller() {
    int x;
    int y;
    getValues(x, y);
    cout &lt;&lt; ""Result: "" &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; "" "" &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes you want to use the same pattern in Java, but you can't; at least not directly. Instead you could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>void getValues(int[] arg1, int[] arg2) {
    arg1[0] = 1;
    arg2[0] = 2;
}
void caller() {
    int[] x = new int[1];
    int[] y = new int[1];
    getValues(x, y);
    System.out.println(""Result: "" + x[0] + "" "" + y[0]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>As was explained in previous answers, in Java you're passing a pointer to the array as a value into <code>getValues</code>. That is enough, because the method then modifies the array element, and by convention you're expecting element 0 to contain the return value. Obviously you can do this in other ways, such as structuring your code so this isn't necessary, or constructing a class that can contain the return value or allow it to be set. But the simple pattern available to you in C++ above is not available in Java.</p>

I've found that when using Gmail as an outbound SMTP server for my webapp, Gmail only lets me send ~10 or so messages before responding with an anti-spam response that I have to manually step through to re-enable SMTP access.  The emails I was sending were not spam, but were website ""welcome"" emails when users registered with my system.  So, YMMV, and I wouldn't rely on Gmail for a production webapp.  If you're sending email on a user's behalf, like an installed desktop app (where the user enters their own Gmail credentials), you may be okay.</p>

Sun wanted too much money for what Jini brought to the table compared to other alternatives.  I would love to hear from folks that disagree!  My opinion is that Jini is sound tech, but business-wise has no future in the enterprise.  It may find a niche elsewhere, depending on what Oracle decides to do with it.</p>

<p>Any method that can accept an Animal should be able to accept a Mammal, but not the other way around.  Subclassing is for making something more specific, not more general.

<p><a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se5.0/html/statements.html#14.17"">JLS 14.17 The return Statement</a></p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>ReturnStatement:
     return Expression(opt) ;
</code></pre>
  
  <p>A <code>return</code> statement with no <code>Expression</code> <strong>attempts</strong> to transfer control to the invoker of the method or constructor that contains it. </p>
  
  <p>A <code>return</code> statement with an <code>Expression</code> <strong>attempts</strong> to transfer control to the invoker of the method that contains it; the value of the <code>Expression</code> becomes the value of the method invocation.</p>
  
  <p>The preceding descriptions say ""<em><strong>attempts</strong> to transfer control</em>"" rather than just ""<em>transfers control</em>"" because if there are any <code>try</code> statements within the method or constructor whose <code>try</code> blocks contain the <code>return</code> statement, then any <code>finally</code> clauses of those <code>try</code> statements will be executed, in order, innermost to outermost, before control is transferred to the invoker of the method or constructor. Abrupt completion of a <code>finally</code> clause can disrupt the transfer of control initiated by a <code>return</code> statement.</p>

<p>Having an ""out-of-the-box"" standardized environment for a development team is a huge time saver.

<p>On the deployment side, having a common Linux install that requires no system-level configuration for end-users except for installing their favorite Java applications' .JAR file would be another big win. </p>

<p>If you still want to create such solution manually you can just create JMS connection in your Ajax servlet (connection per request). Consider using Spring JMS template for that reason ( <a href=""http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jms.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jms.html</a> ). Then just receive the message in the Servlet doGet/doPost method. Consider low timeout value for receiving in that case. Such solution will work for the Queues and durable Topics.</p>

<p>For non-durable Topics consider external message listener. Spring <code>MessageListenerContainer</code> is an excellent tool for that purpose:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean class=""org.springframework.jms.listener.DefaultMessageListenerContainer
   &lt;property name=""connectionFactory"" ref=""jmsFactory""/&gt;
   &lt;property name=""destination"" ref=""myTopic"" /&gt;
   &lt;property name=""messageListener"" ref=""lastTenUpdatesCache"" /&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Bean <code>lastTenUpdatesCache</code> will be a singleton bean implementing <code>MesssageListener</code>. This bean would be responsible for caching last ten messages (just putting it into a java.util list). It will be injected into your Ajax servlet so in your doGet/doPost method you can ask it about last 10 messages sent to the topic.</p>

My opinion is that English is the language of the realm, and even if you name your variables in a different language, there is little to no point to use any non-ASCII characters in your programming. Leave it up to the language to deal with it if you are handling data that is UTF8: my iPhone program (which involves tons of user data going in between the phone and server) has full UTF8 support, but has no UTF8 in the source code.

<p>Hello all.</p>

<p>I've been having various problems implementing an RMI Server/Client architecture, with Client Callbacks. My scenario is that both Server and Client are behind Firewall/NAT. In the end I got a fully working implementation. Here are the main things that I did:</p>

<h2>Server Side , Local IP: 192.168.1.10. Public (Internet) IP 80.80.80.10</h2>

<p>On the Firewall/Router/Local Server PC open port 6620.
On the Firewall/Router/Local Server PC open port 1099.
On the Router/NAT redirect incoming connections on port 6620 to 192.168.1.10:6620
On the Router/NAT redirect incoming connections on port 1099 to 192.168.1.10:1099</p>

<p>In the actual program:</p>

<pre><code>System.getProperties().put(""java.rmi.server.hostname"", IP 80.80.80.10);
MyService rmiserver = new MyService();
MyService stub = (MyService) UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject(rmiserver, 6620);
LocateRegistry.createRegistry(1099);
Registry registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry();
registry.rebind(""FAManagerService"", stub);
</code></pre>

<h2>Client Side, Local IP: 10.0.1.123 Public (Internet) IP 70.70.70.20</h2>

<p>On the Firewall/Router/Local Server PC open port 1999.
On the Router/NAT redirect incoming connections on port 1999 to 10.0.1.123:1999</p>

<p>In the actual program:</p>

<pre><code>System.getProperties().put(""java.rmi.server.hostname"", 70.70.70.20);
UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject(this, 1999);
MyService server = (MyService) Naming.lookup(""rmi://"" + serverIP + ""/MyService "");

Use an obfuscator if it is that important.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Delegates are a useful construct in event-based systems. Essentially
  Delegates are objects that encode a method dispatch on a specified
  object. This document shows how java inner classes provide a more
  generic solution to such problems.</p>
  
  <p>What is a Delegate? Really it is very similar to a pointer to member
  function as used in C++. But a delegate contains the target object
  alongwith the method to be invoked. Ideally it would be nice to be
  able to say:</p>
  
  <p>obj.registerHandler(ano.methodOne); </p>
  
  <p>..and that the method methodOne would be called on ano when some specific event was received.</p>
  
  <p>This is what the Delegate structure achieves.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Java Inner Classes</strong> </p>
  
  <p>It has been argued that Java provides this
  functionality via inner classes and thus does not need the additional
  Delegate construct.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>obj.registerHandler(new Handler() {
        public void handleIt(Event ev) {
            methodOne(ev);
        }
      } );
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>At first glance this seems correct but at the same time a nuisance.
  Because for many event processing examples the simplicity of the
  Delegates syntax is very attractive.</p>
  
  <p><strong>General Handler</strong> </p>
  
  <p>However, if event-based programming is used in a more
  pervasive manner, say, for example, as a part of a general
  asynchronous programming environment, there is more at stake.</p>
  
  <p>In such a general situation, it is not sufficient to include only the
  target method and target object instance. In general there may be
  other parameters required, that are determined within the context when
  the event handler is registered.</p>
  
  <p>In this more general situation, the java approach can provide a very
  elegant solution, particularly when combined with use of final
  variables:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>void processState(final T1 p1, final T2 dispatch) { 
  final int a1 = someCalculation();

  m_obj.registerHandler(new Handler() {
    public void handleIt(Event ev) {
     dispatch.methodOne(a1, ev, p1);
    }
  } );
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>final * final * final</strong> </p>
  
  <p>Got your attention?</p>
  
  <p>Note that the final variables are accessible from within the anonymous
  class method definitions. Be sure to study this code carefully to
  understand the ramifications. This is potentially a very powerful
  technique. For example, it can be used to good effect when registering
  handlers in MiniDOM and in more general situations.</p>
  
  <p>By contrast, the Delegate construct does not provide a solution for
  this more general requirement, and as such should be rejected as an
  idiom on which designs can be based.</p>

  <p>The issue us that the connection does not close properly and is stuck in the 'sleep' mode</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was actually only half right.</p>

<p>The problem I ran into was actually that each app was defining a new connection to the database sever. So each time I closed all the connections App A would make a bunch of new connections as per it's WEB.xml config file and run happily. App B would do the same. The problem is that they are <em>independent pools</em> which try to grab up to the server defined limit. It is a kind of race condition I guess. So when App A has finished with the connections it sits waiting to to use them again until the timeout has passed while App B who needs the connection now is denied the resources even though App A has finished with the and should be back in the pool. Once the timeout has passed, the connection is freed up and B (or C etc) can get at it again.</p>

<p>e.g. if the limit is 10 (mySQL profile limit) and each app has been configured to use a max of 10 the there will be 20 attempts at connections. Obviously this is a bad situation.</p>

<p>The solution is to RTFM and put the <a href=""http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/config/context.html"" rel=""nofollow"">connection details in the right place</a>. This does make shared posting a pain but there are ways around it (such as linking to other xml files from the context).</p>

<p>Just to be explicit: I put the connection details in the WEB.xml for each app and the had a fight about it.</p>

the last few days. First of all, if I have understood correctly, Java already has
some basic notion of closures (defined through anonymous classes) but the new feature
that is going to be introduced is the support for closures based on anonymous functions.</p>

<p>This extension will definitely make the language more expressive but I am not sure
if it really fits with the rest of the language.
Java has been designed as an object-oriented language with no support for functional programming: Will the new semantics be easy to understand? Java 6 does not even have functions, will Java 7 have anonymous functions but no ""normal"" functions?</p>

<p>My impression is that as new programming styles or paradigms like functional
programming become more popular, everyone wants to use them in their
favourite OOP language. This is understandable: one wants to continue to use
a language they're familiar with while adopting new features. But in this way
a language can become really complex and lose coherence.</p>

<p>So my attitude at the moment is to stick to Java 6 for OOP (I hope Java 6 will still
be supported for a while) and, in case I really get interested in doing OOP + FP,
to take a look at some other language like Scala (Scala was defined to be multi-
paradigm from the beginning and can be well integrated with Java) rather than switching
to Java 7.</p>

<p>I think Java owes its success to the fact that it combines a simple language with very
powerful libraries and tools, and I do not think that new features like closures will
make it a better programming language.</p>

<p>With primitives we are passing the actual value of the primitive into the method (or constructor), be it the integer ""5"", the character ""c"", or what have you.  That actual value then becomes its own local primitive.  But with objects, all we are doing is giving the same object an additional reference (a local reference), so that we now have two references pointing to the same object.</p>

<p>Disabling the back button is harder than it should be, due to non-intuitive behavior in the default implementation of WizardPage.getPreviousPage().  You can call setPreviousPage( null ), and getPreviousPage() still returns the previous page.  You need to override the implementation of getPreviousPage() in order to disable the back button:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class MyWizardPage extends WizardPage {
    private boolean backButtonEnabled = true;

    public void setBackButtonEnabled(boolean enabled) {
        backButtonEnabled = enabled;
        getContainer().updateButtons();
    }

    @Override
    public IWizardPage getPreviousPage() {
        if (!backButtonEnabled) {
            return null;
        }
        return super.getPreviousPage();
    }
}

<p>Step one please erase from your mind that word that starts with 'p' ""_ _ _ _ _ _ _"", especially if you come from other programming languages. Java and 'p' cannot be written in the same book, forum, or even txt.</p>

<p>Step two remember that when you pass an Object into a method you're passing the Object reference and not the Object itself.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Student</em>: Master, does this mean that Java is pass-by-reference?</li>
<li><em>Master</em>: Grasshopper, No.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now think of what an Object's reference/variable does/is:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>A variable holds the bits that tell the JVM how to get to the referenced Object in memory (Heap).</strong></li>
<li>When passing arguments to a method <strong>you ARE NOT passing the reference variable, but a copy of the bits in the reference variable</strong>. Something like this: 3bad086a. 3bad086a represents a way to get to the passed object.</li>
<li>So you're just passing 3bad086a that it's the value of the reference.</li>
<li>You're passing the value of the reference and not the reference itself (and not the object).</li>
<li><em><strong>This value is actually COPIED and given to the method</em></strong>. </li>
</ol>

<p>In the following (please don't try to compile/execute this...):</p>

<pre><code>1. Person person;
2. person = new Person(""Tom"");
3. changeName(person);
4.
5. //I didn't use Person person below as an argument to be nice
6. static void changeName(Person anotherReferenceToTheSamePersonObject) {
7.     anotherReferenceToTheSamePersonObject.setName(""Jerry"");
8. }
</code></pre>

<p>What happens?</p>

<ul>
<li>The variable <em>person</em> is created in line #1 and it's null at the beginning.</li>
<li>A new Person Object is created in line #2, stored in memory, and the variable <em>person</em> is given the reference to the Person object. That is, its address. Let's say 3bad086a.</li>
<li>The variable <em>person</em> holding the address of the Object is passed to the function in line #3.</li>
<li>In line #4 you can listen to the sound of silence </li>
<li>Check the comment on line #5</li>
<li>A method local variable -<em>anotherReferenceToTheSamePersonObject</em>- is created and then comes the magic in line #6:
<ul>
<li>The variable/reference <em>person</em> is copied bit-by-bit and passed to <em>anotherReferenceToTheSamePersonObject</em> inside the function.</li>
<li>No new instances of Person are created.</li>
<li>Both ""<em>person</em>"" and ""<em>anotherReferenceToTheSamePersonObject</em>"" hold the same value of 3bad086a.</li>
<li>Don't try this but person==anotherReferenceToTheSamePersonObject would be true.</li>
<li>Both variables have IDENTICAL COPIES of the reference and they both refer to the same Person Object, the SAME Object on the Heap and NOT A COPY.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>A picture is worth a thousand words:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ba3hJ.jpg"" alt=""Pass by Value""></p>

<p><strong>Note that the anotherReferenceToTheSamePersonObject arrows is directed towards the Object and not towards the variable person!</strong></p>

<p>If you didn't get it then just trust me and remember that it's better to say that <strong>Java is pass by value</strong>. Well, <strong>pass by reference value</strong>. Oh well, even better is <strong><em>pass-by-copy-of-the-variable-value! ;)</em></strong></p>

<p>Now feel free to hate me but note that given this <strong>there is no difference between passing primitive data types and Objects</strong> when talking about method arguments.</p>

<p>You always pass a copy of the bits of the value of the reference!</p>

<ul>
<li>If it's a primitive data type these bits will contain the value of the primitive data type itself.</li>
<li>If it's an Object the bits will contain the value of the address that tells the JVM how to get to the Object.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Java is pass-by-value because inside a method you can modify the referenced Object as much as you want but no matter how hard you try you'll never be able to modify the passed variable that will keep referencing (not p _ _ _ _ _ _ _) the same Object no matter what!</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>The changeName function above will never be able to modify the actual content (the bit values) of the passed reference. In other word changeName cannot make Person person refer to another Object.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Of course you can cut it short and just say that  <strong>Java is pass-by-value!</strong></p>

<p>If you spend any time with one of the open source tools, you'll notice that even though they include source-to-source migration as a feature, it's hard to find working examples. I imagine this is because there's no such thing as a one-size-fits-all migration. Each project/team makes unique use of a language and can vary by libraries used, type complexity, idioms, style, etc. It makes sense to define some transformations per migration. This means a project must reach some critical mass before automatic migration is worth the effort.</p>

<p>I've struggled with this for a few months myself. The best solution is to make your application portable so you have the same JNDI name in both Tomcat and Weblogic.</p>

<p>In order to do that, you change your <code>web.xml</code> and <code>spring-beans.xml</code> to point to a single jndi name, and provide a mapping to each vendor specific jndi name.</p>

<p>I've placed each file below.</p>

<p>You need:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <code>&lt;resource-ref /&gt;</code> entry in web.xml for your app to use a single name</li>
<li>A file <code>WEB-INF/weblogic.xml</code> to map your jndi name to the resource managed by WebLogic</li>
<li>A file <code>META-INF/context.xml</code> to map your jndi name to the resource managed by Tomcat
<ul>
<li>This can be either in the Tomcat installation or in your app.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>As a general rule, prefer to have your jndi names in your app like <code>jdbc/MyDataSource</code> and <code>jms/ConnFactory</code> and avoid prefixing them with <code>java:comp/env/</code>.</p>

<p>Also, data sources and connection factories are best managed by the container and used with JNDI. It's a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3111992/difference-between-configuring-data-source-in-persistence-xml-and-in-spring-confi/4138327#4138327"">common mistake to instantiate database connection pools in your application</a>.</p>

<h2>Question:</h2>

<p>One interesting point for me was to see how Groovy deals with implicit returns. In Groovy it is possible to ""return"" from a method simply leaving a value at the end (without return). What do you think happens, if you uncomment the <em>runningThreads.remove(..)</em> line in the finally statement - will this overwrite the regular return value (""OK"") and cover the exception?!</p>

Independently created and published, the creator has earned upwards of 10 million dollars at this point and has started his own company.</p>

<p>The entire core system was initially written by one person in Java (Using a higher level language allows you to be more productive, Java is a good choice because it doesn't sacrifice speed to do so).  It has amazingly fast/smooth graphics and everything you'd expect in a modern independent game.</p>

<p>I also run a Minecraft server on a tiny/old laptop in a 300mb VM.  It manages up to 10 players each in different areas of the map at the same time without significantly changing the server load.</p>

<p>The best part?  The same jar file runs on Mac, PC and Linux.  I run my server on linux and sometimes run a second server on my Mac.  People I personally know are split pretty evenly between PC and non-PC (Mac+Linux) clients.</p>

<p>Perhaps Java isn't currently known terribly well for game development, but I think as developers learn to build better Java code it will become a more well-known alternative.</p>

<p>Many use Stripes plus Stripernate as a single, full stack solution. We don't because we want our business logic within the EJB tier, so we simply rely on JPA Entities as combined Model and DTO.</p>

<p>Stripes does the binding to our Entities/DTO and we shove them back in to the EJB tier for work. For most of our CRUD stuff this is very thing and straightforward, making our 80% use case trivial to work with. Yet we have the flexibility to do whatever we want for the edge cases that always come up with complicate applications.</p>

<p>We have a very large base Action Bean which encapsulates the bulk of our CRUD operations that makes call backs in to the individual subclasses specific to the entities and forms.</p>

<p>We also have a large internal tag file library to manage our pages, security, navigation, tasks, etc. A simple CRUD edit form is little more than a list of field names, and we get all of the chrome and menus and access controls ""for free"".</p>

<p>The beauty of this is that we get to keep the HTTP request based metaphor that we like and we get to choose the individual parts of the system rather than use one fat stack. The Stripes layer is lean and mean, and never gets in our way.</p>

<p>We have a bunch of Ajax integrating YUI and JQuery, all working against our Stripes and EJB stack painlessly.</p>

<p>I also ported a lighter version of the stack to GAE for a sample project, basically having to do minor work to our EJB tier. So, the entire stack is very nimble and amicable to change. Stripes is a big factor of that since we let it do the few things that it does, and does very well. Then delegate the rest to other parts of the stack.</p>

<p>As always there are parts folks would rather have different at times, but Stripes would be the last part to go in our stack, frankly. It could be better at supporting the full HTTP verb set, but I'd rather fix Stripes to do that better than switch over to something else.</p>

<p>I share C# code across the following platforms:
- iOS (iPhone/iPad)
- Android
- The Web (HTML5)
- Mac (OS X)
- Linux
- Windows</p>

<p>I could share it even more places:
- Windows Phone 7
- Wii
- XBox
- PS3
- etc.</p>

<p>The biggie is iOS since <a href=""http://xamarin.com/monotouch"">MonoTouch</a> works fantastically. I do not know of any good way to target iOS with Java. You cannot target Windows Phone 7 with Java, so I would say that the days of Java being better for mobile are behind us.</p>

<p>The biggest factor for me though is personal productivity (and happiness). C# as a language is years ahead of Java IMHO and the .NET framework is a joy to use. Most of what is being added in Java 7 and Java 8 has been in C# for years. JVM languages like Scala and Clojure (both available on the CLR) are pretty nice though.</p>

<p>I see Mono as a platform in it's own right (a great one) and treat .NET as the Microsoft implementation of Mono on Windows. This means that I develop and test on Mono first. This works wonderfully.</p>

<p>If both Java and .NET (Mono let's say) were Open Source projects without any corporate backing, I would choose Mono over Java every time. I believe it is just a better platform.</p>

<p>Both .NET/Mono and the JVM are great choices, although I would personally use some other language than Java on the JVM.</p>

<h1>My take on some of the other comments:</h1>

<p><strong>Issue: Performance.</strong></p>

<p>**Answer: Both the JVM and the CLR perform better than detractors say they do. I would say that the JVM performs better. Mono is generally slower than .NET (though not always).</p>

<p>I personally would take ASP.NET MVC over J2EE any day both as a developer and an end-user. Support for <a href=""http://www.mono-project.com/Release_Notes_Mono_2.10#Google_Native_Client_Support"">Google Native Client</a> is pretty cool too. Also, I know that poor GUI performance for desktop Java apps is supposed to be a thing of the past but I keep finding slow ones. Then again, I could say the same for WPF. GTK# is plenty fast though so there is no reason they have to be slow.</p>

<p><strong>Issue: Java has a larger ecosystem of libraries available.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer: Probably true, but it is a non-issue in practice.</strong></p>

<p>Practically every Java library (including the JDK) runs just dandy on .NET/Mono thanks to <a href=""http://www.ikvm.net/"">IKVM.NET</a>. This piece of technology is a true marvel. The integration is amazing; you can use a Java library just like it was native. I have only had to use Java libraries in one .NET app though. The .NET/Mono ecosystem generally offers more than I need.</p>

<p><strong>Issue: Java has better (broader) tools support</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer: Not on Windows. Otherwise I agree. MonoDevelop is nice though.</strong></p>

<p>I want to give a shout-out to <a href=""http://monodevelop.com/"">MonoDevelop</a>; it is a jewel. MonoDevelop integrates most of the tools I want use including code completion (intellisense), Git/Subversion integration, support for unit tests, SQL integration, debugging, easy refactoring, and assembly browsing with on-the-fly decompilation. It is wonderful to use the same environment for everything from server-side web to mobile apps.</p>

<p><strong>Issue: Compatibility across platforms.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer: Mono is a single code-base across all platforms, including Windows.</strong></p>

<p>Develop for Mono first and deploy to .NET on Windows if you like. If you compare .NET from MS to Java though then Java has the edge in terms of consistency across platforms. See next answer...</p>

<p><strong>Issue: Mono lags .NET.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer: No it does not.</strong> IMHO, this is an often stated but incorrect statement.</p>

<p>The Mono distribution from Xamarin ships with C#, VB.NET, F#, IronPython, IronRuby, and I think maybe Boo out of the box. The Mono C# compiler is completely up to date with MS. The Mono VB.NET compiler does lag the MS version. The other compilers are the same on both platforms (as are other .NET languages like Nemerle, Boo, and Phalanger (PHP) ).</p>

<p>Mono ships with a lot of the actual Microsoft written code including the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR), Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF), F#, and ASP.NET MVC. Because Razor is not Open Source, Mono currently ships with MVC2 but MVC3 works on Mono just fine.</p>

<p>The core Mono platform has kept pace with .NET or many years and the compatibility is impressive. You can use the full C# 4.0 language and even some C# 5.0 features today. In fact, Mono often leads .NET in many ways.</p>

<p>Mono implements parts of the CLR spec that even Microsoft does not support (like 64 bit arrays). One of the most exciting new pieces of technology in the .NET world is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Roslyn"">Rosylyn</a>. Mono has offered the C# compiler as a service for many years. Some of what Rosylyn offers is available via <a href=""http://wiki.sharpdevelop.net/NRefactory.ashx"">NRefractory</a> as well. An example of were Mono is still ahead would be the SIMD instructions to accelerate gaming performance.</p>

<p>Microsoft does offer a number of products on top of .NET that are not available in Mono which is were the misconception about Mono lagging comes from. Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Entity Framework (EF), WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) are examples of products which do not work, or are poorly supported, on Mono. The obvious solution is to use cross-platform alternatives like GTK#, NHibernate, and ServiceStack instead.</p>

<p><strong>Issue: Microsoft is evil.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer: True. So what.</strong></p>

<p>Many people offer the following reasons to avoid using Mono:</p>

<p>1) You should not use Mono because Microsoft tech should be avoided</p>

<p>2) Mono sucks because it does not let you use every technology that Microsoft offers</p>

<p>To me, it is clear that these statements are incompatible. I reject the first statement but will skip that argument here. The second statement is true of all .NET alternatives.</p>

<p>The JVM is a great platform and the explosion of JVM languages is awesome. Use what makes you happy. For now, that is often .NET/Mono for me.</p>

<p>Using Junit4</p>

<p>Split your tests up so that there is one test method per class (this solution only changes classloaders between classes, not between methods as the parent runner gathers all the methods once per class)</p>

<p>Add the @RunWith(SeparateClassloaderTestRunner.class) annotation to your test classes.</p>

<p>Create the SeparateClassloaderTestRunner to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class SeparateClassloaderTestRunner extends BlockJUnit4ClassRunner {

    public SeparateClassloaderTestRunner(Class&lt;?&gt; clazz) throws InitializationError {
        super(getFromTestClassloader(clazz));
    }

    private static Class&lt;?&gt; getFromTestClassloader(Class&lt;?&gt; clazz) throws InitializationError {
        try {
            ClassLoader testClassLoader = new TestClassLoader();
            return Class.forName(clazz.getName(), true, testClassLoader);
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
            throw new InitializationError(e);
        }
    }

    public static class TestClassLoader extends URLClassLoader {
        public TestClassLoader() {
            super(((URLClassLoader)getSystemClassLoader()).getURLs());
        }

        @Override
        public Class&lt;?&gt; loadClass(String name) throws ClassNotFoundException {
            if (name.startsWith(""org.mypackages."")) {
                return super.findClass(name);
            }
            return super.loadClass(name);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note I had to do this to test code running in a legacy framework which I couldn't change. Given the choice I'd reduce the use of statics and/or put test hooks in to allow the system to be reset.  It may not be pretty but it allows me to test an awful lot of code that would be difficult otherwise.</p>

<p>Also this solution breaks anything else that relies on classloading tricks such as mokito.</p>

<p>The nice thing about this idiom is that you can verify that the delegated-to method exists, and has the required signature, at the point where you create the delegator (although not at compile-time, unfortunately, although a FindBugs plug-in might help here), then use it safely to delegate to various instances.</p>

<ol>
<li>The HashMap class is roughly equivalent to Hashtable, except that it is non synchronized and permits nulls. (HashMap allows null values as key and value whereas Hashtable doesn't allow nulls).</li>
<li>HashMap does not guarantee that the order of the map will remain constant over time.</li>
<li>HashMap is non synchronized whereas Hashtable is synchronized.</li>
<li>Iterator in the HashMap is  fail-safe while the enumerator for the Hashtable is not and throw ConcurrentModificationException if any other Thread modifies the map structurally  by adding or removing any element except Iterator's own remove()  method. But this is not a guaranteed behavior and will be done by JVM on best effort.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note on Some Important Terms    </p>

<ol>
<li>Synchronized means only one thread can modify a hash table at one point of time. Basically, it means that any thread before performing an update on a hashtable will have to acquire a lock on the object while others will wait for lock to be released.</li>
<li>Fail-safe is relevant from the context of iterators. If an iterator has been created on a collection object and some other thread tries to modify the collection object ""structurally"", a concurrent modification exception will be thrown. It is possible for other threads though to invoke ""set"" method since it doesn't modify the collection ""structurally"". However, if prior to calling ""set"", the collection has been modified structurally, ""IllegalArgumentException"" will be thrown.</li>
<li>Structurally modification means deleting or inserting element which could effectively change the structure of map.</li>
</ol>

<p>HashMap can be synchronized by</p>

<p><code>Map m = Collections.synchronizeMap(hashMap);</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Map provides Collection views instead of direct support for iteration
  via Enumeration objects. Collection views greatly enhance the
  expressiveness of the interface, as discussed later in this section.
  Map allows you to iterate over keys, values, or key-value pairs;
  Hashtable does not provide the third option. Map provides a safe way
  to remove entries in the midst of iteration; Hashtable did not.
  Finally, Map fixes a minor deficiency in the Hashtable interface.
  Hashtable has a method called contains, which returns true if the
  Hashtable contains a given value. Given its name, you'd expect this
  method to return true if the Hashtable contained a given key, because
  the key is the primary access mechanism for a Hashtable. The Map
  interface eliminates this source of confusion by renaming the method
  containsValue. Also, this improves the interface's consistency —
  containsValue parallels containsKey.</p>

Hence I create a solution for this.Maybe you want to down vote me because of my answer, because it's not a direct answer to the question,  but here I share my tips on how to be able to achieve the same pass by reference result we often wants :</p>

<pre><code>private HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt; prepareCluster(DBF dbf1, User user) throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, xBaseJException
{
    HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt; result = new HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt;(); 
    CollectRecord record;
    CharField fldKey = (CharField) dbf1.getField(""KEY"");
    String clusterKey = fldKey.get().toString();                    
    String utmZone = clusterKey.substring(0,2);
    String easting = clusterKey.substring(2,5);
    String northing = clusterKey.substring(5,9);
    String year = generateYear(clusterKey.substring(9, 11));
    String control = clusterKey.substring(11,12);
    String tract = clusterKey.substring(12, 13);
    String subplot = clusterKey.substring(13, 15);
    String smallOrBig = clusterKey.substring(15, 16);


    ...
    result.put(""cluster"", cluster);
    result.put(""tract"", tract);
    result.put(""subplot"", subplot);
    result.put(""control"", control);
    result.put(""year"", year);
    result.put(""clusterKey"", clusterKey);
    result.put(""record"", record);

    return result; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Just set the return result to be of <code>HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt;</code>, before returning, put the desired value in the HashMap. After calling this method, you must accessed the desired value using the usual <code>get</code> method of a HashMap :</p>

<pre><code>HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt; result = prepareCluster(dbf1, user);
Entity cluster = (Entity) result.get(""cluster"");
String tract = (String) result.get(""tract"");
String subplot = (String) result.get(""subplot"");
String control = (String) result.get(""control"");
String year = (String) result.get(""year"");
String clusterKey = (String) result.get(""clusterKey"");
CollectRecord record = (CollectRecord) result.get(""record"");
</code></pre>

<p>This way, you can achieve the same result of modifying a passed variabel (pass by reference) and get those multiple result from a method.</p>

<p>This hopefully answers your second question. Regarding your first question; I've been taught both by teachers and (as far as I can remember) Java compilers that a Java class name should be an identifier that begins with a capital letter A-Z, but I can't find any reliable source on this. When trying it out with OpenJDK there are no warnings when beginning class names with lower-case letters or even a $-sign. When using a $-sign, you do have to escape it if you compile from a bash shell, however.</p>

For those who don't have access to a copy, the question is framed as a kind of filter/test for candidates interviewing for a position requiring ""really good Java programmers.""</p>

<p>Specifically, he asks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would you write a program, in pure Java, that would cause the Java Virtual Machine to crash?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've programmed in Java for over 15 years, and I found this question to be both puzzling and unfair. As others have pointed out, Java, as a managed language, is specifically designed <em>not to crash</em>. Of course there are always JVM bugs, but:</p>

<ol>
<li>After 15+ years of production-level JREs, it's rare.</li>
<li>Any such bugs are likely to be patched in the next release, so how likely are you as a programmer to run into and recall the details of the current set of JRE show-stoppers?</li>
</ol>

<p>As others have mentioned, some native code via JNI is a sure way to crash a JRE. But the author specifically mentioned <em>in pure Java</em>, so that's out.</p>

<p>Another option would be to feed the JRE bogus byte codes; it's easy enough to dump some garbage binary data to a .class file, and ask the JRE to run it:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo 'crap crap crap' &gt; crap.class
$ java crap
Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.ClassFormatError: Incompatible magic value 1668440432 in class file crap
</code></pre>

<p>Does that count? I mean the JRE itself hasn't crashed; it properly detected the bogus code, reported it, and exited. </p>

<p>This leaves us with the most obvious kinds of solutions such as blowing the stack via recursion, running out of heap memory via object allocations, or simply throwing <code>RuntimeException</code>. But this just causes the JRE to exit with a <code>StackOverflowError</code> or similar exception, which, again <em>is not really a crash</em>.</p>

<p>So what's left? I'd really love to hear what the author really had in mind as a proper solution.</p>

<p>Compare this to say C++ where you can have a method to take an <code>int&amp;</code>, or in C# where you could have take a <code>ref int</code> (although, in this case, you also have to use the <code>ref</code> modifier when passing the variable's name to the method.)</p>

Annotation is a mechanism for tagging classes with metadata so that, they can be used by metadata-aware programs. Generics is a mechanism of specifying types for objects belonging to collections, such as Arraylists, so that type safety is guaranteed at compile time. Autoboxing allows the automatic conversions between primitive types (e.g. int) and wrapper types (e.g. Integer). Improved syntax for looping includes the enhancements for each loop for going through the items of array or collections comparatively easily.</p>

<p>Java 6 focuses on new specifications and APIs including XML, Web Services, JDBC version 4.0, programming based on Annotations, API’s for Java compiler and Application client GUI.With new compiler API added with Java 6, the java compiler can now receive and/or send output to an abstraction of the file system (programs can specify/process compiler output). Furthermore, Java 6 added enhancements to the applications GUI capabilities in AWT (faster splash screens and support for system tray) and SWING (better drag-and-drop, support for customizing layouts, multithreading enhancements and ability to write GIF images).</p>

<p><strong>What is different from Zentus's SQLite JDBC?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The original Zentus's SQLite JDBC driver
  <a href=""http://www.zentus.com/sqlitejdbc/"">http://www.zentus.com/sqlitejdbc/</a> itself is an excellent utility for
  using SQLite databases from Java language, and our SQLiteJDBC library
  also relies on its implementation. However, its pure-java version,
  which totally translates c/c++ codes of SQLite into Java, is
  significantly slower compared to its native version, which uses SQLite
  binaries compiled for each OS (win, mac, linux).</p>
  
  <p>To use the native version of sqlite-jdbc, user had to set a path to
  the native codes (dll, jnilib, so files, which are JNDI C programs) by
  using command-line arguments, e.g., -Djava.library.path=(path to the
  dll, jnilib, etc.), or -Dorg.sqlite.lib.path, etc. This process was
  error-prone and bothersome to tell every user to set these variables.
  Our SQLiteJDBC library completely does away these inconveniences.</p>
  
  <p>Another difference is that we are keeping this SQLiteJDBC libray
  up-to-date to the newest version of SQLite engine, because we are one
  of the hottest users of this library. For example, SQLite JDBC is a
  core component of UTGB (University of Tokyo Genome Browser) Toolkit,
  which is our utility to create personalized genome browsers.</p>

In general, the JVM aims to optimize more dynamic, higher-level code while the CLR gives you more low-level tools to do these kinds of optimizations yourself. </p>

<p>A good example is stack allocation. On the CLR you have explicit stack allocation of custom value types. On the JVM the only custom types are reference types but the JVM can convert heap allocations to stack allocations in certain circumstances through Escape Analysis.</p>

<p>Another example. In Java, methods are virtual by default. On C# at least, they are not. It is much more difficult to optimize virtual method calls because the code that gets executed at a given call site cannot be determined statically.</p>

<p>Under the hood, their execution systems are quite different. Most JVMs (in particular, Hotspot) start out with a bytecode interpreter and only JIT-compile parts of the code that are executed heavily e.g. tight loops. They can also re-compile these over and over each time using execution statistics collected from previous runs to drive optimizations. This allows more optimization effort to be applied to the parts of the program that need it most. This is called adaptive optimization.</p>

<p>The CLR compiles everything up-front only once. It does fewer optimization both because it has more code to compile and so has to be fast and because it doesn't have any statistics of the actual execution paths taken to feed into its optimizations. This approach does have the very significant advantage of allowing you to cache compilation results across processes, which CLR does but JVM does not.</p>

<p>A large percentage of the Hotspot JVM code is dedicated to these adaptive optimizations and they are what put Java in the same performance ballpark as native code for most general purpose computation in the early 2000s. They are also what makes the JVM a decent target for dynamic languages. I'm excluding here the more recent developments of the Dynamic Languages Runtime and invokedynamic as I don't know enough about the DLR.</p>

<p>Passing Variables into Methods (Objective 7.3)
7.3 Determine the effect upon object references and primitive values when they are passed into methods that perform assignments or other modifying operations on the parameters.
Methods can be declared to take primitives and/or object references. You need to know how (or if) the caller's variable can be affected by the called method. The difference between object reference and primitive variables, when passed into methods, is huge and important. To understand this section, you'll need to be comfortable with the assignments section covered in the first part of this chapter.
Passing Object Reference Variables
When you pass an object variable into a method, you must keep in mind that you're passing the object reference, and not the actual object itself. Remember that a reference variable holds bits that represent (to the underlying VM) a way to get to a specific object in memory (on the heap). More importantly, you must remember that you aren't even passing the actual reference variable, but rather a copy of the reference variable. A copy of a variable means you get a copy of the bits in that variable, so when you pass a reference variable, you're passing a copy of the bits representing how to get to a specific object. In other words, both the caller and the called method will now have identical copies of the reference, and thus both will refer to the same exact (not a copy) object on the heap.
For this example, we'll use the Dimension class from the java.awt package:</p>

<pre><code>         1. import java.awt.Dimension;
         2. class ReferenceTest {
</code></pre>

<p>3.   public static void main (String [] args) {
4.     Dimension d = new Dimension(5,10);
5.     ReferenceTest rt = new ReferenceTest();
6.     System.out.println(""Before modify() d.height = ""
+ d.height);
7.     rt.modify(d);
8.     System.out.println(""After modify() d.height = ""
9. }
                10.
                11.
                12.
                13.   }
                14. }</p>

<p>When we run this class, we can see that the modify() method was indeed able to modify the original (and only) Dimension object created on line 4.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>            C:\Java Projects\Reference&gt;java ReferenceTest
            Before modify() d.height = 10
            dim = 11
            After modify() d.height = 11
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice when the Dimension object on line 4 is passed to the modify() method, any changes to the object that occur inside the method are being made to the object whose reference was passed. In the preceding example, reference variables d and dim both point to the same object.
Does Java Use Pass-By-Value Semantics?
If Java passes objects by passing the reference variable instead, does that mean Java uses pass-by-reference for objects? Not exactly, although you'll often hear and read that it does. Java is actually pass-by-value for all variables running within a single VM. Pass-by-value means pass-by-variable-value. And that means, pass-by-copy-of- the-variable! (There's that word copy again!)
It makes no difference if you're passing primitive or reference variables, you are always passing a copy of the bits in the variable. So for a primitive variable, you're passing a copy of the bits representing the value. For example, if you pass an int variable with the value of 3, you're passing a copy of the bits representing 3. The called method then gets its own copy of the value, to do with it what it likes.</p>

<p>And if you're passing an object reference variable, you're passing a copy of the bits representing the reference to an object. The called method then gets its own copy of the reference variable, to do with it what it likes. But because two identical reference variables refer to the exact same object, if the called method modifies the object (by invoking setter methods, for example), the caller will see that the object the caller's original variable refers to has also been changed. In the next section, we'll look at how the picture changes when we're talking about primitives.
The bottom line on pass-by-value: the called method can't change the caller's variable, although for object reference variables, the called method can change the object the variable referred to. What's the difference between changing the variable and changing the object? For object references, it means the called method can't reassign the caller's original reference variable and make it refer to a different object, or null. For example, in the following code fragment,</p>

<pre><code>        void bar() {
           Foo f = new Foo();
           doStuff(f);
        }
        void doStuff(Foo g) {
           g.setName(""Boo"");
           g = new Foo();
        }
</code></pre>

<p>reassigning g does not reassign f! At the end of the bar() method, two Foo objects have been created, one referenced by the local variable f and one referenced by
the local (argument) variable g. Because the doStuff() method has a copy of the reference variable, it has a way to get to the original Foo object, for instance to call the setName() method. But, the doStuff() method does not have a way to get to the f reference variable. So doStuff() can change values within the object f refers to, but doStuff() can't change the actual contents (bit pattern) of f. In other words, doStuff() can change the state of the object that f refers to, but it can't make f refer to a different object!
Passing Primitive Variables
Let's look at what happens when a primitive variable is passed to a method:</p>

<pre><code>               class ReferenceTest {
                  public static void main (String [] args) {
      int a = 1;
      ReferenceTest rt = new ReferenceTest();
      System.out.println(""Before modify() a = "" + a);
      rt.modify(a);
      System.out.println(""After modify() a = "" + a);
    }
    void modify(int number) {
      number = number + 1;
      System.out.println(""number = "" + number);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this simple program, the variable a is passed to a method called modify(),
which increments the variable by 1. The resulting output looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>  Before modify() a = 1
  number = 2
  After modify() a = 1
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that a did not change after it was passed to the method. Remember, it was a copy of a that was passed to the method. When a primitive variable is passed to a method, it is passed by value, which means pass-by-copy-of-the-bits-in-the-variable.</p>

<p>If you can, I'd recommend using an output stream as your base, and if you need to write strings, use an OUtputStreamWriter wrapper around the stream to do it. It is far more reliable to convert text to bytes than the other way around, which is likely why WriterOutputStream is not a part of the standard Java library</p>
