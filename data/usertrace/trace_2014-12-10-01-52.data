<p>In general, java has primitive types (<code>int</code>, <code>bool</code>, <code>char</code>, <code>double</code>, etc) that are passed directly by value. Then java has objects (everything that derives from <code>java.lang.Object</code>). Objects are actually always handled through a reference (a reference being a pointer that you can't touch). That means that in effect, objects are passed by value, as the references are normally not interesting. It does however mean that you cannot change which object is pointed to as the reference itself is passed by value.</p>

<p>Does this sound strange and confusing? Let's consider how C implements pass by reference and pass by value. In C the default convention is pass by value. <code>void foo(int x)</code> passes an int by value. <code>void foo(int *x)</code> is a function that does not want an <code>int a</code>, but a pointer to an int: <code>foo(&amp;a)</code>. One would use this with the <code>&amp;</code> operator to pass a variable address.</p>

<p>Take this to C++, and we have references. References are basically (in this context) syntactic sugar that hide the pointer part of the equation: <code>void foo(int &amp;x)</code> is called by <code>foo(a)</code>, where the compiler itself knows that it is a reference and the address of the non-reference <code>a</code> should be passed. In java, all variables referring to objects are actually of reference type, in effect forcing call by reference for most intends and purposes without the fine grained control (and complexity) afforded by e.g. C++.</p>

<p>Firstly, with a complex enough regexp, i beleive this can be impossible. But you should be able to put something together for simple regexps.</p>

<p>If you take a look at the source code of the class java.util.regex.Pattern, you'll see that it uses an internal representation of Node instances. Each of the different pattern components have their own implementation of a Node subclass. These Nodes are organised into a tree.</p>

<p>By producing a visitor that traverses this tree, you should be able to call an overloaded generator method or some kind of Builder that cobbles something together.</p>

  <p>Spolsky:  Yep.  There's a new product also, if you don't want to use the Team System there our friends at Redgate have a product called SQL Data Generator [<a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql_data_generator/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql_data_generator/index.htm</a>].  It's $295, and it just generates some realistic test data.  And it does things like actually generate real cities in the city column that actually exist, and then when it generates those it'll get the state right, instead of getting the state wrong, or putting states into German cities and stuff like... you know, it generates pretty realistic looking data.  I'm not really sure what all the features are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is probably not what you are looking for, but it might be a good starting off point, instead of creating your own.</p>

<p>I can't seem to find anything in google, so I would suggest tackling the problem by parsing a given regular expression into the smallest units of work (\w, [x-x], \d, etc) and writing some basic methods to support those regular expression phrases.</p>

<p>So for \w you would have a method getRandomLetter() which returns any random letter, and you would also have getRandomLetter(char startLetter, char endLetter) which gives you a random letter between the two values.</p>

2014-12-10 02:11:32:0233, answer_open, VisualItem[tree.nodes,7,id=40878,type=21,title=,body=<p>There are several differences between HashMap and Hashtable in Java:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html">Hashtable</a> is synchronized, whereas <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html">HashMap</a> is not.  This makes <code>HashMap</code> better for non-threaded applications, as unsynchronized Objects typically perform better than synchronized ones.</li>
<li><code>Hashtable</code> does not allow null keys or values.  <code>HashMap</code> allows one null key and any number of <code>null</code> values.</li>
<li>One of HashMap's subclasses is <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashMap.html">LinkedHashMap</a>, so in the event that you'd want predictable iteration order (which is insertion order by default), you could easily swap out the <code>HashMap</code> for a <code>LinkedHashMap</code>.  This wouldn't be as easy if you were using <code>Hashtable</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Since synchronization is not an issue for you, I'd recommend <code>HashMap</code>. If synchronization becomes an issue, you may also look at <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html">ConcurrentHashMap</a>.</p>

Anyway, many APIs in the JDK pro-actively throws NullPointerException. </p>

<p>For example, the Javadoc for Map.containsKey states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@throws NullPointerException if the key is null and this map
    does not permit null keys (optional).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's perfectly valid to throw your own NPE. The convention is to include the parameter name which was null in the message of the exception. </p>

<p>The pattern goes:</p>

<pre><code>public void someMethod(Object mustNotBeNull) {  
    if (mustNotBeNull == null) {  
        throw new NullPointerException(mustNotBeNull + " must not be null");  

    }  
}
</code></pre>

<p>Whatever you do, don't allow a bad value to get set and throw an exception later when other code attempts to use it. That makes debugging a nightmare. You should always the follow the "fail-fast" principle.</p>
