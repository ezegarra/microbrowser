Regardless of the decision, it is pretty trivial to run both.  TestNG strives to be much more configurable than JUnit, but in the end they both work equally well.</p>

<p>TestNG has a neat feature where you can mark tests as a particular group, and then easily run all tests of a specific group, or exclude tests of a particular group.  Thus you can mark tests that run slowly as in the "slow" group and then ignore them when you want quick results.  A suggestion from their documentation is to mark some subset as "checkin" tests which should be run whenever you check new files in.  I never saw such a feature in JUnit, but then again, if you don't have it, you don't REALLY miss it.</p>

<p>For all its claims of high configuration, I did run into a corner case the a couple weeks ago where I couldn't do what I wanted to do... I wish I could remember what it is, but I wanted to bring it up so you know that it's not perfect.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage TestNG has is annotations... which JUnit added in version 4 anyways.</p>,solution=,x=0.0,y=0.0,viewcount=0,answercount=0,acceptedanswerid=-1,owner=Anonymous,lasteditdate=1414747669142L,lastactivitydate=0L,tags=,score=36]

I spent sometime considering which move was better, and eventually we realized that TestNG has no 'killer features'. It's nice, and has some features JUnit 4 doesn't have, but we don't need them.<br>
We didn't want people to feel uncomfortable writing tests while getting to know TestNG because we wanted them to keep writing a lot of tests.<br>
Also, JUnit is pretty much the de-facto standard in the Java world. There's no decent tool that doesn't support it from the box, you can find a lot of help on the web and they added a lot of new features in the past year which shows it's alive.</p>

<p>We decided to stick with JUnit and never looked back.</p>

Junit3 works perfectly well, and the introduction of annotations in 4 doesn't buy you very much (in my opinion).  It is much more important that you guys <em>write</em> tests, and it sounds like you do.  </p>

<p>Use whatever seems most natural and helps you get your work done.</p>

<p>I can't comment on TestNG b/c I haven't used it.  But I would recommend <a href="http://www.unitils.org/summary.html">unitils</a>, a great wrapper for JUnit/TestNG/DBUnit/EasyMock, regardless of which route you take. (It supports all the flavors mentioned above)</p>
