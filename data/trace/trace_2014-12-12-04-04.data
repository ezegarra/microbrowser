Personally, I would not do it even if you are not planning on bringing anyone who doesn't speak the language in on the project, because you are running a business and it seems to me that one running a business would want his business to expand, which in this day and age means transcending national borders. My opinion is that English is the language of the realm, and even if you name your variables in a different language, there is little to no point to use any non-ASCII characters in your programming. Leave it up to the language to deal with it if you are handling data that is UTF8: my iPhone program (which involves tons of user data going in between the phone and server) has full UTF8 support, but has no UTF8 in the source code. It just seems to open such a large can of worms for almost no benefit.</p>
