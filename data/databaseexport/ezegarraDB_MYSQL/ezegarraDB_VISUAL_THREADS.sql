For those that don\'t know (probably everyone), Project Darkstar is a framework for massively multiplayer online games that attempts to take care of all of the \"hard stuff.\"  The basic idea is that you write your game server logic in such a way that all operations are broken up into tiny tasks.  You pass these tasks to the Project Darkstar framework which handles distributing them to a specific node in the cluster, any concurrency issues, and finally persisting the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apparently doing this kind of thing is a much different problem for video games than it is for enterprise applications.  Jim Waldo, who gave the lecture, claims that MMO games have a DB read/write ratio of 50/50, whereas enterprise apps are more like 90% read, 10% write.  He also claims that most existing MMOs keep everything in memory exlcusively, and only dump to a DB every 6 hours of so.  This means if a server goes down, you would lose all of the work since the last DB dump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the project itself sounds really cool, but I don\'t think the industry will accept it.  First, you have to write your server code in Java.  The client code can be written in anything (Jim claims ActionScript 3 is the most popular, follow by C++), but the server stuff has to be Java.  Sounds good to me, but I really get the impression that everyone in the games industry hates Java.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, unlike other industries where developers prefer to use existing frameworks and libraries, the guys in the games industry seem to like to write everything themselves.  Not only that, they like to rewrite everything for every new game they produce.  Things are starting to change where developers are using Havok for physics, Unreal Engine 3 as their platform, etc., but for the most part it looks like everything is still proprietary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, are the guys at Project Darkstar just wasting their time?  Can a general framework like this really work for complex games with the performance that is required?  Even if it does work, are game companies willing to use it?</p>\r\n',1471,'Outlaw Programmer',21981,'hazzen','7/13/2009 22:26','7/3/2012 14:54','Is Project Darkstar Realistic?','<java><concurrency><distributed>',7,NULL,6,'12/14/2012 2:39',NULL),(20127,1,20870,NULL,'8/21/2008 14:41',6,2380,'<p>I am messing around with <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/zemscript/\">a toy interpreter in Java</a> and I was considering trying to write a simple compiler that can generate bytecode for the Java Virtual Machine.

Here is a concrete example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suppose I have a web application, built using Struts2 and Hibernate. If an exception bubbles up to my \"action\", I log it, and display a pretty apology to the user. But one of the functions of my web application is creating new user accounts, that require a unique user name. If a user picks a name that already exists, Hibernate throws an <code>org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException</code> (an unchecked exception) down in the guts of my system. I\'d really like to recover from this particular problem by asking the user to choose another user name, rather than giving them the same \"we logged your problem but for now you\'re hosed\" message.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are a few points to consider:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>There a lot of people creating accounts simultaneously.

In the case of relational databases, there might be some tricks to work around this, but what I\'m really interested in is the general case where pre-checking for an exception won\'t work because of a fundamental race condition. Same thing could apply to looking for a file on the file system, etc.</li>\r\n<li>Given my CTO\'s propensity for drive-by management induced by reading technology columns in \"Inc.\", I need a layer of indirection around the persistence mechanism so that I can throw out Hibernate and use Kodo, or whatever, without changing anything except the lowest layer of persistence code. As a matter of fact, there are several such layers of abstraction in my system. How can I prevent them from leaking in spite of unchecked exceptions?</li>\r\n<li>One of the declaimed weaknesses of checked exceptions is having to \"handle\" them in every call on the stack&mdash;either by declaring that a calling method throws them, or by catching them and handling them. Handling them often means wrapping them in another checked exception of a type appropriate to the level of abstraction. So, for example, in checked-exception land, a file-system&ndash;based implementation of my UserRegistry might catch <code>IOException</code>, while a database implementation would catch <code>SQLException</code>, but both would throw a <code>UserNotFoundException</code> that hides the underlying implementation.

We do not want the user to have to install a \"browser wide\" download manager (like GetRight), we want it to only work with downloading on our site. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Here is some additional info to help clarify what I\'m trying to do.  Most of the files above the 4GB limit would be large HD video files (its for a video editing company).  These will be downloaded by users across the internet, this isn\'t going to be people on a local network.  We want the files to be available via HTTP (some users are going to be behind firewalls that aren\'t going to allow FTP, Bittorrent, etc.).  The will be a library of files the end user could download, so we aren\'t talking about a one time large download.  The will be download different large files on a semi-regular basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far Vault that @Edmund-Tay suggested is the closest solution so far.  The only problem is that it doesn\'t work for files larger than 4GB (it instantly fails before starting the download, they are probably using a 32bit integer somewhere that the content length of the file exceeds).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A java applet (or ActiveX component since the problem only exist in IE) that worked like the article @spoulson linked to would be the best solution, but so far I haven\'t had any luck finding one that does anything like that (multipart downloads, resume, etc.).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It looks like we might have to write our own.  Another option would be to write a .Net application (maybe ClickOnce) that is associated with an extension or mime type.  Then the user would actually be downloading a small file from the web server that opens in the exe/ClickOnce app that tells the application what file to download.  That is how the MSDN downloader works.  The end user would then only have to download/install an EXE once.  That would be better than downloading an exe every time they wanted to download a large file.</p>\r\n',3543,'TonyB',3543,'TonyB','9/4/2008 18:02','1/28/2009 14:05','Large File Download','<java><flash><silverlight><browser>',15,2,1,NULL,NULL),(35507,1,234746,NULL,'8/30/2008 0:19',2,844,'<p>I have been working with Struts for some time, but for a project I am finishing I was asked to separate Templates (velocity .vm files), configs (struts.xml, persistence.xml) from main WAR file.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have all in default structure like: </p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n    application\r\n    |-- <i><b>META-INF</b></i>            -- Some configs are here\r\n    |-- <i><b>WEB-INF</b></i>             -- others here\r\n    |   |-- classes\r\n    |   |   |-- META-INF\r\n    |   |   `-- mypackage\r\n    |   |       `-- class-files\r\n    |   `-- lib\r\n    |-- css\r\n    `-- <i><b>tpl</b></i>                 -- Template dir to be relocated\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>And I apparently can\'t find documentation about how to setup (probably in struts.xml) where my templates go, and where config files will be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think I will have to use configurations on the application server too (I am using Jetty 5.1.14).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, any lights on how to configure it ? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, the whole thing about changing templates place is to put the templates in a designer accessible area, so any modification needed, the designer can load them to his/her computer, edit, and upload it again.

Two of the most I hate are Anonymous Classes and Static Blocks. We have a lot of legacy code that make use of Static Blocks and these are one of the annoying points in our push in writing unit tests. Our goal is to be able to write unit tests for classes that depend on this static initialization with minimal code changes. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far my suggestion to my colleagues is to move the body of the static block into a private static method and call it <code>staticInit</code>. This method can then be called from within the static block. For unit testing another class that depends on this class could easily mock <code>staticInit</code> with JMockit to not do anything. Let\'s see this in example.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>public class ClassWithStaticInit {\r\n  static {\r\n    System.out.println(\"static initializer.\");\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Will be changed to</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>public class ClassWithStaticInit {\r\n  static {\r\n    staticInit();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private static void staticInit() {\r\n    System.out.println(\"static initialized.\");\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>So that we can do the following in a JUnit.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>public class DependentClassTest {\r\n  public static class MockClassWithStaticInit {\r\n    public static void staticInit() {\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @BeforeClass\r\n  public static void setUpBeforeClass() {\r\n    Mockit.redefineMethods(ClassWithStaticInit.class, MockClassWithStaticInit.class);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>However this solution also comes with its own problems. You can\'t run <code>DependentClassTest</code> and <code>ClassWithStaticInitTest</code> on the same JVM since you actually want the static block to run for <code>ClassWithStaticInitTest</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What would be your way of accomplishing this task?

You\'d be very hard-pressed to change the type of a private field without ripple effects to every class that calls that getter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, from a strictly OO point of view, objects should be responding to messages (methods) that correspond to their (hopefully) single responsibility. The vast majority of getters and setters don\'t make sense for their constituent objects; Pen.dispenseInkOnto(Surface) makes more sense to me than Pen.getColor().</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getters and setters also encourage users of the class to ask the object for some data, perform a calculation, and then set some other value in the object, better known as procedural programming.

Compare and contrast: Java 5 version:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>Deque&lt;Integer&gt; queue;<br><br>void add(int n) {<br>    queue.add(n);<br>}<br><br>int remove() {<br>    return queue.remove();<br>}<br></code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Java 1.4 or earlier (no generics either):</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>Deque queue;<br><br>void add(int n) {<br>    queue.add(Integer.valueOf(n));<br>}<br><br>int remove() {<br>    return ((Integer) queue.remove()).intValue();<br>}<br></code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>It must be noted that despite the brevity in the Java 5 version, both versions generate identical bytecode. Thus, although auto-boxing and auto-unboxing is very convenient because you write less code, these operations <em>do</em> happen behind the scenes, with the same runtime costs, so you still have to be aware of their existence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>',13,NULL,13,'Chris Jester-Young','8/3/2008 5:10','8/3/2008 5:10',NULL,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1266,2,NULL,564,'8/4/2008 14:11',14,NULL,'<p>I\'ll just post here since some of the other posts are slightly inaccurate in relation to C#.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Correct: int is an alias for System.Int32. <br>\r\nWrong: float is not an alias for System.Float, but for System.Single</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basically, int is a reserved keyword in the C# programming language, and is an alias for the System.Int32 value type.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>float and Float is not the same however, as the right system type for \'\'float\'\' is System.Single.

Never let pass the original NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBounds, etc in this case!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>There are at least three very good reasons against the case of mapping all kinds of argument constraint violations to IllegalArgumentException, with the third probably being so severe as to mark the practice bad style:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(1) A programmer cannot a safely assume that all cases of argument constraint violations result in IllegalArgumentException, because the large majority of standard classes use this exception rather as a wastebasket if there is no more specific kind of exception available. Trying to map all cases of argument constraint violations to IllegalArgumentException in your API only leads to programmer frustration using your classes, as the standard libraries mostly follow different rules that violate yours, and most of your API users will use them as well!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(2) Mapping the exceptions actually results in a different kind of anomaly, caused by single inheritance: All Java exceptions are classes, and therefore support single inheritance only. Therefore, there is no way to create an exception that is truly say both a NullPointerException and an IllegalArgumentException, as subclasses can only inherit from one or the other. Throwing an IllegalArgumentException in case of a null argument therefore makes it harder for API users to distinguish between problems whenever a program tries to programmatically correct the problem, for example by feeding default values into a call repeat!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(3) Mapping actually creates the danger of bug masking: In order to map argument constraint violations into IllegalArgumentException, you\'ll need to code an outer try-catch within every method that has any constrained arguments. However, simply catching RuntimeException in this catch block is out of the question, because that risks mapping documented RuntimeExceptions thrown by libery methods used within yours into IllegalArgumentException, even if they are no caused by argument constraint violations. So you need to be very specific, but even that effort doesn\'t protect you from the case that you accidentally map an undocumented runtime exception of another API (i.e. a bug) into an IllegalArgumentException of your API. Even the most careful mapping therefore risks masking programming errors of other library makers as argument constraint violations of your method\'s users, which is simply hillareous behavior!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the standard practice on the other hand, the rules stay simple, and exception causes stay unmasked and specific. For the method caller, the rules are easy as well:\r\n- if you encounter a documented runtime exception of any kind because you passed an illegal value, either repeat the call with a default (for this specific exceptions are neccessary), or correct your code\r\n- if on the other hand you enccounter a runtime exception that is not documented to happen for a given set of arguments, file a bug report to the method\'s makers to ensure that either their code or their documentation is fixed.</p>\r\n',1940048,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'12/31/2012 17:44',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(4166,2,NULL,4080,'8/7/2008 0:20',1,NULL,'<p>We use FindBugs and JDepend integrated with Ant.

I was using PMD for a little while before I noticed the <a href=\"http://pmd.sourceforge.net/cpd.html\">\"Finding Duplicated Code\" link</a> on the <a href=\"http://pmd.sourceforge.net\">PMD web page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><p>I\'d like to point out that these tools can sometimes be extended beyond their \"out-of-the-box\" set of rules. And not just because they\'re open source so that you can rewrite them. Some of these tools come with applications or \"hooks\" that allow them to be extended. For example, PMD comes with the <a href=\"http://pmd.sourceforge.net/howtowritearule.html\">\"designer\" tool</a> that allows you to create new rules. Also, Checkstyle has the <a href=\"http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_misc.html#DescendantToken\">DescendantToken</a> check that has properties that allow for substantial customization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><p>I integrate these tools with <a href=\"http://virtualteamtls.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/virtualteamtls/trunk/scm/common.xml?view=markup\">an Ant-based build</a>. You can follow the link to see my commented configuration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><p>In addition to the simple integration into the build, I find it helpful to configure the tools to be somewhat \"integrated\" in a couple of other ways. Namely, report generation and warning suppression uniformity. I\'d like to add these aspects to this discussion (which should probably have the \"static-analysis\" tag also): how are folks configuring these tools to create a \"unified\" solution? (I\'ve asked this question separately <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/79918/configuring-static-analysis-tools-for-uniformity\">here</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><p>First, for warning reports, I transform the output so that each warning has the simple format:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>/absolute-path/filename:line-number:column-number: warning(tool-name): message</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p><p>This is often called the \"Emacs format,\" but even if you aren\'t using Emacs, it\'s a reasonable format for homogenizing reports. For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>/project/src/com/example/Foo.java:425:9: warning(Checkstyle):Missing a Javadoc comment.</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p><p>My warning format transformations are done by my Ant script with Ant <a href=\"http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/filterchain.html\">filterchains</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><p>The second \"integration\" that I do is for warning suppression. By default, each tool supports comments or an annotation (or both) that you can place in your code to silence a warning that you want to ignore. But these various warning suppression requests do not have a consistent look which seems somewhat silly. When you\'re suppressing a warning, you\'re suppressing a warning, so why not always write \"<code>SuppressWarning</code>?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><p>For example, PMD\'s default configuration suppresses warning generation on lines of code with the string \"<code>NOPMD</code>\" in a comment. Also, PMD supports Java\'s <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation. I configure PMD to use comments containing \"<code>SuppressWarning(PMD.</code>\" instead of <code>NOPMD</code> so that PMD suppressions look alike. I fill in the particular rule that is violated when using the comment style suppression:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>// SuppressWarnings(PMD.PreserveStackTrace) justification: (false positive) exceptions are chained</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p><p>Only the \"<code>SuppressWarnings(PMD.</code>\" part is significant for a comment, but it is consistent with PMD\'s support for the <code>@SuppressWarning</code> annotation which does recognize individual rule violations by name:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>@SuppressWarnings(\"PMD.CompareObjectsWithEquals\") // justification: identity comparision intended</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p><p>Similarly, Checkstyle suppresses warning generation between pairs of comments (no annotation support is provided). By default, comments to turn Checkstyle off and on contain the strings <code>CHECKSTYLE:OFF</code> and <code>CHECKSTYLE:ON</code>, respectively. Changing this configuration (with Checkstyle\'s \"SuppressionCommentFilter\") to use the strings \"<code>BEGIN&nbsp;SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.</code>\" and \"<code>END&nbsp;SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.</code>\" makes the controls look more like PMD:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>// BEGIN SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField) justification: \"Effective Java,\" 2nd ed., Bloch, Item 2</code>\r\n<code>// END SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField)</code>\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p><p>With Checkstyle comments, the particular check violation (<code>HiddenField</code>) <em>is</em> significant because each check has its own \"<code>BEGIN/END</code>\" comment pair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><p>FindBugs also supports warning generation suppression with a <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation, so no further configuration is required to achieve some level of uniformity with other tools. Unfortunately, Findbugs has to support a custom <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation because the built-in Java <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation has a <code>SOURCE</code> retention policy which is not strong enough to retain the annotation in the class file where FindBugs needs it. I fully qualify FindBugs warnings suppressions to avoid clashing with Java\'s <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>@edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressWarnings(\"UWF&#95;FIELD&#95;NOT&#95;INITIALIZED&#95;IN&#95;CONSTRUCTOR\")</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p><p>These techniques makes things look reasonably consistent across tools. Note that having each warning suppression contain the string \"<code>SuppressWarnings</code>\" makes it easy to run a simple search to find all instances for all tools over an entire code base.</p>\r\n',13940,NULL,13940,'Greg','10/27/2010 14:34','10/27/2010 14:34',NULL,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(80009,2,NULL,4080,'9/17/2008 4:31',1,NULL,'<p>I\'ve had good luck with Cobertura.

My understanding is that once it gets to a system loadLibrary call (i.e. Java has found the library in its java.library.path and is now telling the OS to load it) - it is completely dependent on the operating system to find any dependent libraries, because at that point it is the operating system that is loading the library for the process, and the OS only knows how to look in the system path. That seems hard to set in the case of a Webstart app, but there is a way around this that does not involve static compiling. You may be able to shuffle where your libraries are - I am unsure </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you use a custom classloader, you can override loadLibrary and findLibrary so that it can locate your libraries from within a jar in your classpath, and if you also make it aware of your native library dependencies (i.e. libB depends on libA depends on libX, then when loading libB you can catch yourself and ensure you load libA first, and in checking that notice and load libX first. Then the OS doesn\'t try to find a library that isn\'t in your path.

Things like annotations and dataproviders are still much better in TestNG. Also they are more flexible in terms of test execution, since TestNG has test dependency, grouping and ordering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JUnit still requires certain before/after methods to be static, which limits what you can do prior to the running of tests, TestNG never has this issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TBH, mostly the differences between the two frameworks don\'t mean much, unless your focusing on integration/automation testing. JUnit from my experience is built from the ground up for unit testing and is now being pushed towards higher levels of testing, which IMO makes it the wrong tool for the job. TestNG does well at unit testing and due to its robust dataproviding and great test execution abilities, works even better at integration/automation test level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now for what I believe is a separate issue, how to write well structured, readable and maintainable tests. Most of this I am sure you know, but things like <strong>Factory Pattern</strong>, <strong>Command Pattern</strong> and <strong>PageObjects</strong> (if your testing websites) are vital, it is very important to have a layer of abstraction between what your testing (SUT) and what the actual test is (assertions of business logic).

Can you please explain me MathContext in the context of BigDecimal#round method.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s nothing special about <code>BigDecimal.round()</code> <em>vs.</em> any other <code>BigDecimal</code> method.  In all cases, the <code>MathContext</code> specifies the number of significant digits and the rounding technique.  Basically, there are two parts of every <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/math/MathContext.html\"><code>MathContext</code></a>.  There\'s a precision, and there\'s also a <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/math/RoundingMode.html\"><code>RoundingMode</code></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The precision again specifies the number of significant digits.  So if you specify <code>123</code> as a number, and ask for 2 significant digits, you\'re going to get <code>120</code>.  It might be clearer if you think in terms of scientific notation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><code>123</code> would be <code>1.23e2</code> in scientific notation.  If you only keep 2 significant digits, then you get <code>1.2e2</code>, or <code>120</code>.  By reducing the number of significant digits, we reduce the precision with which we can specify a number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <code>RoundingMode</code> part specifies how we should handle the loss of precision.  To reuse the example, if you use <code>123</code> as the number, and ask for 2 significant digits, you\'ve reduced your precision.  With a <code>RoundingMode</code> of <code>HALF_UP</code> (the default mode), <code>123</code> will become <code>120</code>.  With a <code>RoundingMode</code> of <code>CEILING</code>, you\'ll get <code>130</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>System.out.println(new BigDecimal(\"123.4\",\r\n                   new MathContext(4,RoundingMode.HALF_UP)));\r\nSystem.out.println(new BigDecimal(\"123.4\",\r\n                   new MathContext(2,RoundingMode.HALF_UP)));\r\nSystem.out.println(new BigDecimal(\"123.4\",\r\n                   new MathContext(2,RoundingMode.CEILING)));\r\nSystem.out.println(new BigDecimal(\"123.4\",\r\n                   new MathContext(1,RoundingMode.CEILING)));\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Outputs:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>123.4\r\n1.2E+2\r\n1.3E+2\r\n2E+2\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>You can see that both the precision and the rounding mode affect the output.</p>\r\n',872,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'8/11/2008 6:06',NULL,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(4194330,2,NULL,7539,'11/16/2010 12:55',9,NULL,'<p>For rounding just the fractional part of a BigDecimal, check out the <code>BigDecimal.setScale(int newScale, int roundingMode)</code> method.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E.g. to change a number with three digits after the decimal point to one with two digits, and rounding up:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>BigDecimal original = new BigDecimal(\"1.235\");\r\nBigDecimal scaled = original.setScale(2, BigDecimal.ROUND_HALF_UP);\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>The result of this is a BigDecimal with the value 1.24 (because of the rounding up rule)</p>\r\n',374167,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'11/16/2010 12:55',NULL,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7599,2,NULL,7596,'8/11/2008 8:00',2,NULL,'<p>Class names should always be descriptive and self-explanatory.

This anti-pattern usually shows itself as a package for something like \'listeners\' or \'actions\' that groups otherwise unrelated classes simply because they happen to implement the same interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within a module, or in a small application, use packages for the application layers. Likely packages include things like the following, depending on the architecture:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.view</em></li>\r\n<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.model</em></li>\r\n<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.services</em></li>\r\n<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.rules</em></li>\r\n<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.persistence</em> (or \'dao\' for data access layer)</li>\r\n<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.util</em> (beware of this being used as if it were \'misc\')</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Within each of these layers, it is natural to group classes by type if there are a lot. A common anti-pattern here is to unnecessarily introduce too many packages and levels of sub-package so that there are only a few classes in each package.</p>\r\n',2670,'Peter Hilton',NULL,NULL,NULL,'9/4/2008 13:40',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(66745,2,NULL,7596,'9/15/2008 20:43',4,NULL,'<p>Where I\'m working, we\'re using Maven 2 and we have a pretty nice archetype for our projects. The goal was to obtain a good separation of concerns, thus we defined a project structure using multiple modules (one for each application \'layer\'):\r\n  - common: common code used by the other layers (e.g., i18n)\r\n  - entities: the domain entities\r\n  - repositories: this module contains the daos interfaces and implementations\r\n  - services-intf: interfaces for the services (e.g, UserService, ...) \r\n  - services-impl: implementations of the services (e.g, UserServiceImpl) \r\n  - web: everything regarding the web content (e.g., css, jsps, jsf pages, ...)\r\n  - ws: web services</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each module has its own dependencies (e.g., repositories could have jpa) and some are project wide (thus they belong in the common module). Dependencies between the different project modules clearly separate things (e.g., the web layer depends on the service layer but doesn\'t know about the repository layer).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each module has its own base package, for example if the application package is \"com.foo.bar\", then we have:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>com.foo.bar.common\r\ncom.foo.bar.entities\r\ncom.foo.bar.repositories\r\ncom.foo.bar.services\r\ncom.foo.bar.services.impl\r\n...\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Each module respects the standard maven project structure:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>   src\\\r\n   ..main\\java\r\n     ...\\resources\r\n   ..test\\java\r\n     ...\\resources\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Unit tests for a given layer easily find their place under \\src\\test... Everything that is domain specific has it\'s place in the entities module. Now something like a FileStorageStrategy should go into the repositories module, since we don\'t need to know exactly what the implementation is. In the services layer, we only know the repository interface, we do not care what the specific implementation is (separation of concerns).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are multiple advantages to this approach:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>clear separation of concerns</li>\r\n<li>each module is packageable as a jar (or a war in the case of the web module) and thus allows for easier code reuse (e.g., we could install the module in the maven repository and reuse it in another project)</li>\r\n<li>maximum independence of each part of the project</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I know this doesn\'t answer all your questions, but I think this could put you on the right path and could prove useful to others.</p>\r\n',5717,'S&#233;bastien D.',5717,'S&#233;bastien D.','9/16/2008 15:55','9/16/2008 15:55',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7668,2,NULL,7661,'8/11/2008 10:58',0,NULL,'<p>Someone took the javascript code from Google Maps and ported it to python: <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/gheat/source/browse/trunk/__/lib/python/gmerc.py\" rel=\"nofollow\">gmerc.py</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\'ve used this and it works great.</p>\r\n',309844,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'8/11/2008 10:58',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7679,2,NULL,7661,'8/11/2008 11:29',3,NULL,'<p><a href=\"http://geotools.codehaus.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GeoTools</a> has code to transform to and from about any coordinate system you could imagine, and among them also Google Map\'s.

Leverage it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, when using your Domain Object classes for form population, you will want to take heed of the recent security concerns around the Spring Framework. <a href=\"http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=50076\" rel=\"nofollow\">A discussion on the Server Side</a> reveals the way to close the hole in the comments.</p>\r\n',543,'bpapa',543,'bpapa','8/12/2008 23:49','8/12/2008 23:49',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(13367,2,NULL,8569,'8/16/2008 21:12',16,NULL,'<p>Small tip - I\'ve found it helpful to modularize and clearly label my Spring xml context files based on application concern. Here\'s an example for a web app I worked on:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>MyProject / src / main / resources / spring /</code>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em><strong>datasource.xml</strong></em>  -  My single data source bean.</li>\r\n<li><em><strong>persistence.xml</strong></em>  -  My DAOs/Repositories. Depends on <code>datasource.xml</code> beans.</li>\r\n<li><em><strong>services.xml</strong></em>  -  Service layer implementations. These are usually the beans to which I apply transactionality using AOP. Depends on <code>persistence.xml</code> beans.</li>\r\n<li><em><strong>controllers.xml</strong></em>  - My Spring MVC controllers. Depends on <code>services.xml</code> beans.</li>\r\n<li><em><strong>views.xml</strong></em> - My view implementations.</li>\r\n</ul></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This list is neither perfect nor exhaustive, but I hope it illustrates the point. Choose whatever naming strategy and granularity works best for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my (limited) experience, I\'ve seen this approach yeild the following benefits:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Clearer architecture</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly named context files gives those unfamiliar with your project structure a reasonable \r\nplace to start looking for bean definitions. Can make detecting circular/unwanted dependencies a little easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Helps domain design</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to add a bean definition, but it doesn\'t fit well in any of your context files, perhaps there\'s a new concept or concern emerging? Examples:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Suppose you want to make your Service layer transactional with AOP. Do you add those bean definitions to <code>services.xml</code>, or put them in their own <code>transactionPolicy.xml</code>? Talk it over with your team. Should your transaction policy be pluggable?</li>\r\n<li>Add Acegi/Spring Security beans to your <code>controllers.xml</code> file, or create a <code>security.xml</code> context file? Do you have different security requirements for different deployments/environments?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Integration testing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can wire up a subset of your application for integration testing (ex: given the above files, to test the database you need to create only <code>datasource.xml</code> and <code>persistence.xml</code> beans).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, you can annotate an integration test class as such:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>@ContextConfiguration(locations = { \"/spring/datasource.xml\" , \"/spring/persistence.xml\" })\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Works well with Spring IDE\'s Beans Graph</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having lots of focused and well-named context files makes it easy to create custom BeansConfigSets to visualize the layers of your app using Spring IDE\'s <a href=\"http://springide.org/project/wiki/BeansGraph\">Beans Graph</a>.

In WSDL, the abstract definition of endpoints and messages is separated from their concrete network deployment or data format bindings. This allows the reuse of abstract definitions: messages, which are abstract descriptions of the data being exchanged, and port types which are abstract collections of operations. The concrete protocol and data format specifications for a particular port type constitutes a reusable binding.

Wing is quite right that these should probably be <strong><em>constants</em></strong> (or maybe enums).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Bruce needs, at it\'s heart, is simply a lookup table.  He doesn\'t need a hierarchy of objects and interfaces; he needs a way to look up a schedule based on a season and a group identifier.  Turning things into objects only makes sense if they have responsibilities or state.  If they have neither, then they are simply identifiers, and building special objects for them just makes the codebase larger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You <em>could</em> build, e.g., <code>Group</code> objects that each contain a set of schedule strings (one for each season), but if all the <code>Group</code> object does is provide lookup functionality, then you\'ve reinvented the lookup table in a much less intuitive fashion.

There\'s now an additional code dependency that did not previously exist.  Updating the set of schedules is now more difficult, as either a custom tool must be coded or a DB-specific interface must be used, whereas previous notepad.exe was sufficient.  Scalability is not a concern here, either.  The needs of this system could increase by a million and the flat file would still work just fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certainly, it\'s possible that in the future needs will evolve to the point that it\'s worth moving to a database.  That\'s when you make the change.  Trying to future-proof an application never works, because we <em>always</em> assume incorrectly about future needs.  We can\'t say it\'ll only take a few hours to embed the database either, because we suck at estimating schedules, too.  If there even comes a time when the database is appropriate, <em>then</em> refactor the code to use a database.

It\'s more of a design question, but then everything that OSGi gives you in terms of design, you can have with vanilla Java as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the runtime, you cannot just add an existing application and make it OSGi enabled.

In its simplest form you make a single OSGi bundle out of your entire application. Clearly this is not a best practice but it can be useful to get a feel for deploying a bundle in an OSGi container (Equinox, Felix, Knoplerfish, etc).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To take it to the next level you\'ll want to start splitting your app into components, components should typically have a set of responsibilities that can be isolated from the rest of your application through a set of interfaces and class dependencies. Identifying these purely by hand can range from rather straightforward for a well designed highly cohesive but loosely coupled application to a nightmare for interlocked source code that you are not familiar with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some help can come from tools like <a href=\"http://clarkware.com/software/JDepend.html\">JDepend</a> which can show you the coupling of Java packages against other packages/classes in your system. A package with low efferent coupling should be easier to extract into an OSGi bundle than one with high efferent coupling.

The fact that security constraints are not present in a WSE WSDL is a big disappointment to me (WCF will include WS-Trust information in a WSDL).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the client end, you\'ll need to use <a href=\"http://ws.apache.org/rampart/\">Rampart</a> to add the necessary WS-Security headers to your outgoing client message. Since the WSDL does not report what WS-Security settings are necessary, you\'re best off by asking the service provider what is required. WS-Security requirements may be simple plaintext password, or might be X509 certificates, or might be encrypted message..... Rampart should be able to handle most of these scenarios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apache Rampart is \"turned on\" by engaging the module in your axis2.xml file. You\'ll need to download the Rampart module and put it in a specific place in your axis2 directory, then modify the xml file. You can also engage Rampart programatically (please edit your original question if this is a requirement and I\'ll edit this response).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on how you configure rampart (through other XML files or programatically), it will intercept any outgoing messages and add the necessary WS-Security information to it. I\'ve personally used axis2 with rampart to call a WSE3 service that is secured with UsernameToken in plaintext and it worked great. Similar, but more advanced scenarios should also work.  There are more details on how to set up and get started with Rampart on the site linked above.

Then rewrite it into a policy that rampart could understand.  (Some <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/466238/Official-Documentation-ws-apache-org-Axis2-Part-2\">updated docs</a> helped.)</li>\r\n<li>Configure rampart with this policy.</li>\r\n<li>Take the keys that were provided in the .pfx file and convert them to a java key store.  There is a utility that comes with Jetty that can do that.</li>\r\n<li>Configure rampart with that key store.</li>\r\n<li>Write a custom axis2 handler that backward-converts the newer ws-addressing stuff that comes out of axis2 into the older stuff expected by the service.</li>\r\n<li>Configure axis2 to use the handler on outgoing messages.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end it was a lot of configuration and code for something that is supposed to be an open standard supported by the vendors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although I\'m not sure what the alternative is...can you wait for the vendors (or in this case, the one vendor) to make sure that everything will inter-op?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a postscript I\'ll add that I didn\'t end up doing the work, it was someone else on my team, but I think I got the salient details correct.  The other option that I was considering (before my teammate took over) was to call the WSS4J API directly to construct the SOAP envelope as the .NET service expected it.

Add a Subject Line</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can prefill the subject line in the email by adding the subject preceded by \'<strong>?subject=</strong>\' after the email address. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the link now becomes: </p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"mailto:someone@yoursite.com?subject=Mail from Our Site\"&gt;Email Us&lt;/a&gt; \r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.

To add some thing to the body of the email it is again as simple as above - \'<strong>?body=</strong>\' after the email address. However formatting that email can be a little tricky. To create spaces between words you will have to use hex code - for example \'<strong>%20</strong>\' between each word, and to create new lines will mean adding \'<strong>%0D</strong>\'.

For example, if you\'ve got a list containing a lot of objects, DB4O activation of these lists is slow. There are a number of ways to get around this problem, for example, by inverting the relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another pain is activation. When you retrieve or delete an object from DB4O, by default it will activate the whole object tree. For example, loading a Foo will load Foo.Bar.Baz.Bat, etc until there\'s nothing left to load. While this is nice from a programming standpoint, performance will slow down the more nesting in your objects. To improve performance, you can tell DB4O how many levels deep to activate. This is time-consuming to do if you\'ve got a lot of objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another area of pain was text searching. DB4O\'s text searching is far, far slower than SQL full text indexing. (They\'ll tell you this outright on their site.) The good news is, it\'s easy to setup a text searching engine on top of DB4O. On our project, we\'ve hooked up Lucene.NET to index the text fields we want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some APIs don\'t seem to work, such as the GetField APIs useful in applying database upgrades. (For example, you\'ve renamed a property and you want to upgrade your existing objects in the database, you need to use these \"reflection\" APIs to find objects in the database. Other APIs, such as the [Index] attribute don\'t work in the stable 6.4 version, and you must instead specify indexes using the Configure().Index(\"someField\"), which is not strongly typed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\'ve witnessed performance degrade the larger your database. We have a 1GB database right now and things are still fast, but not nearly as fast as when we started with a tiny database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\'ve found another issue where Db4O.GetByID will close the database if the ID doesn\'t exist anymore in the database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\'ve found the Native Query syntax (the most natural, language-integrated syntax for queries) is far, far slower than the less-friendly SODA queries. So instead of typing:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>// C# syntax for \"Find all MyFoos with Bar == 23\".\r\n// (Note the Java syntax is more verbose using the Predicate class.)\r\nIList&lt;MyFoo&gt; results = db4o.Query&lt;MyFoo&gt;(input =&gt; input.Bar == 23);\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of that nice query code, you have to an ugly SODA query which is string-based and not strongly-typed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For .NET folks, they\'ve recently introduced a LINQ-to-DB4O provider, which provides for the best syntax yet. However, it\'s yet to be seen whether performance will be up-to-par with the ugly SODA queries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DB4O support has been decent: we\'ve talked to them on the phone a number of times and have received helpful info. Their user forums are next to worthless, however, almost all questions go unanswered. Their JIRA bug tracker receives a lot of attention, so if you\'ve got a nagging bug, file it on JIRA on it often will get fixed.

The performance we\'ve got has blown away some O/RM frameworks we tried.

In tracing the GC starts from the \"roots\" - things like stack references, and traces all reachable (live) objects. Anything that can\'t be reached is considered dead. In reference counting each time a reference is modified the object\'s involved have their count updated. Any object whose reference count gets set to zero is considered dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With basically all GC implementations there are trade offs but tracing is usually good for high through put (i.e. fast) operation but has longer pause times (larger gaps where the UI or program may freeze up).

I think the next release (2.0) to be delivered in JEE6 will really bring it into its own, with a new template syntax (similar to Facelets) and a simplified component model (custom components in only 1 file... finally).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, of course, there are a million smaller frameworks and tools that get their own following (<a href=\"http://velocity.apache.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Velocity</a> for basic needs, raw <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages\" rel=\"nofollow\">JSPs</a>, Struts, etc).  I generally prefer component oriented frameworks myself, though.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, I\'d recommend just taking a look at Tapestry, Wicket, and JSF and just picking the one that feels the best to you.

My experience is with Tapestry 4, not 5, so your mileage may vary. My opinion of Tapestry has changed over the years; I have modified this post to reflect it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can no longer recommend Tapestry as I did previously. Tapestry 5 appears to be a significant improvement, but my main issue with Tapestry is not with platform itself; it\'s with the people behind it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historically, every major version update of Tapestry has broken backwards compatibility with extreme prejudice, far more than one might expect. This seems to be due to the incorporation of new coding techniques or technologies that require significant rewrites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Howard Lewis Ship (the principal author of Tapestry) is certainly a brilliant developer, but I can\'t say I care for his management of the Tapestry project. Development of Tapestry 5 began almost immediately after Tapestry 4 shipped. From what I can tell, Ship pretty much devoted himself to that, leaving Tapestry 4 in the hands of other contributors, who I feel are not nearly as capable as Ship. After having made the painful switch from Tapestry 3 to Tapestry 4, I felt that I had been abandoned almost immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, with the release of Tapestry 5, Tapestry 4 became a legacy product. I wouldn\'t have a problem with this if the upgrade path wasn\'t so brutal <strong>again</strong>. So now our development team is in the rather unenviable position: We could continue to use an essentially abandoned web platform (Tapestry 4), make the heinous upgrade to Tapestry 5, or give up on Tapestry entirely and rewrite our application using another platform. None of these options is very attractive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tapestry 5 is supposedly written so as to reduce the likelihood of update breakage from this point forward. A good example is in the page classes: in previous incarnations, page classes descended from a base class provided by Tapestry; incompatible API changes in this class were the cause of a large number of backward compatibility problems. In Tapestry 5, pages are POJOs which are enhanced at runtime with the \"magic Tapestry fairy dust\" via annotations. So as long as the contract for the annotations is maintained, changes to Tapestry won\'t affect your page classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If this is right, then writing a new application using Tapestry 5 could turn out well. But personally, I don\'t feel like putting my hand on the burner again.</p>\r\n',4287,'Robert J. Walker',4287,'Robert J.

However, if string manipulation works for you, then go for it! There are plenty of cases where small or simple XML text can be safely built by hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just be aware that creating XML text is harder than it looks. Here\'s some criteria I would consider:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>First: how much <em>control</em> do you have on the information that goes into the xml?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The less control you have on the source data, the more likely you will have trouble, and the more advantageous the library becomes. For example: (a) Can you <em>guarantee</em> that the element names will never have a character that is illegal in a name? (b) How about quotes in an attribute\'s content? Can they happen, and are you handling them? (c) Does the data ever contain anything that might need to be encoded as an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_entity\" rel=\"nofollow\">entity</a> (like the less-than which often needs to be output as <strong>&amp;lt;</strong>); are you doing it correctly?</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Second, maintainability: is the code that builds the XML easy to understand <em>by someone else</em>?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>You probably don\'t want to be stuck with the code for life. I\'ve worked with second-hand C++ code that hand-builds XML and it can be surprisingly obscure. Of course, if this is a personal project of yours, then you don\'t need to worry about \"others\": substitute \"in a year\" for \"others\" above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wouldn\'t worry about performance. If your XML is simple enough that you can hand-write it, any overhead from the library is probably meaningless. Of course, your case might be different, but you should measure to prove it first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, Yes; you can hand build XML text by hand if it\'s simple enough; but not knowing the libraries available is <em>probably</em> not the right reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A modern XML library is a quite powerful tool, but it can also be daunting.

I have used Matisse, the NetBeans GUI code generator. While Matisse (now known as \"<a href=\"http://netbeans.org/features/java/swing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Swing GUI Builder</a>\") makes it pleasant to layout components, it is similar to all other code generation tools because when you use Matisse you must live in constant fear that someone else edited the \"you cannot edit this in NetBeans\" GUI sections outside of NetBeans. As soon as you touch the layout builder again it could destroy their work and then you have a broken GUI. There might be some simple task like re-ordering a variable initialization and its use or re-naming a variable (this was especially a problem when using Matisse\'s database feature). You know how to do this by editing the un-editable source code but may waste time trying to figure out how to do the same thing in the GUI builder.

Talk about a waste...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joshua Bloch covers this in <em>Effective Java Programming Language Guide</em> [my bible of first resort on Best Practices] <strong>Chapter 8. Exceptions</strong> <em>Item 42: Favor the use of standard exceptions</em>. Here\'s a bit of what he says,</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p>Reusing preexisting exceptions has several benefits. Chief among these, it makes your API easier to learn and use because <strong>it matches established conventions with which programmers are already familiar</strong> [<em>my emphasis, not Bloch\'s</em>]. A close second is that programs using your API are easier to read because they aren\'t cluttered with unfamiliar exceptions. Finally, fewer exception classes mean a smaller memory footprint and less time spent loading classes.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>The most commonly reused exception is IllegalArgumentException. This is generally the exception to throw when the caller passes in an argument whose value is inappropriate. For example, this would be the exception to throw if the caller passed a negative number in a parameter representing the number of times some action were to be repeated.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, you should <strong>never</strong> throw Exception itself. Java has a well-chosen, diverse and well-targeted bunch of built-in exceptions that cover most situations <strong>AND</strong> describe the exception that occurred well enough so that you can remedy the cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be friendly to the programmers who have to maintain your code in the future.</p>\r\n',335648,'Mark Jaeger',NULL,NULL,NULL,'10/19/2008 16:04',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(27112,2,NULL,27065,'8/25/2008 23:30',0,NULL,'<p>I recommend: <a href=\"http://members.fortunecity.com/neshkov/dj.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">DJ Java Decompiler.</a> It\'s free to try and costs $19.99 to purchase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\'ve also heard good things about <a href=\"http://www.bysoft.se/sureshot/cavaj/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cavaj</a>, but never used it personally.

If you didn\'t think this was unreasonably complicated already!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lazy loaded objects are subclasses</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your objects are persisted using an ORM, in many cases you will be dealing with dynamic proxies to avoid loading object too early from the data store. These proxies are implemented as subclasses of your own class. This means that<code>this.getClass() == o.getClass()</code> will return false. For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>Person saved = new Person(\"John Doe\");\r\nLong key = dao.save(saved);\r\ndao.flush();\r\nPerson retrieved = dao.retrieve(key);\r\nsaved.getClass().equals(retrieved.getClass()); // Will return false if Person is loaded lazy\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p><em>If you\'re dealing with an ORM using <code>o instanceof Person</code> is the only thing that will behave correctly.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lazy loaded objects have null-fields</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ORMs usually use the getters to force loading of lazy loaded objects. This means that <code>person.name</code> will be null if <code>person</code> is lazy loaded, even if <code>person.getName()</code> forces loading and returns \"John Doe\". In my experience, this crops up more often in <code>hashCode</code> and <code>equals</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>If you\'re dealing with an ORM, make sure to always use getters, and never field references in <code>hashCode</code> and <code>equals</code>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Saving an object will change it\'s state</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Persistent objects often use a <code>id</code> field to hold the key of the object. This field will be automatically updated when an object is first saved. Don\'t use an id field in <code>hashCode</code>. But you can use it in <code>equals</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A pattern I often use is</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>if (this.getId() == null) {\r\n    return this == other;\r\n} else {\r\n    return this.getId() == other.getId();\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>But: You cannot include <code>getId()</code> in <code>hashCode()</code>.

If it has then it internally notes that this particular object has finalize() method.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p>When an object is ready for garbage collection, then the garbage collector thread checks if this particular object has finalize() from table mentioned in (1).</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>2a)    If it doesnâ€™t then it is sent for garbage collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2b) It is has, then it is added to the finalization queue. And it removes the entry of the object from the table (1).</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Finalizer thread keeps polling the queue. For every object in the queue, its finalize() method is called. After calling the finalize() cycle from (2) is again repeated. If this object still has no strong reference, then sent for GC. If\r\n    it has then ALWAYS (2a) is called because the entry was deleted in (2b)</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>Basically finalize() method is only called once.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>So whatâ€™s the issue with the above cycle?</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p>From (1). Its take extra time in object creation. Memory allocation in Java is 5x to 10x faster than malloc/calloc etc. All the time gained is lost in the procedure of noting the object in the table etc. I once tried it. Create 100000 objects in a loop and measure the time taken for program to terminate in 2 cases: One with no finalize(), Second with finalize(). Found it to be 20% faster.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>From (2b): Memory Leakage and Starvation. If the object in the queue has references to a lot of memory resources, then all those objects wont get freed unless this object is ready for GC.If all the objects are heavy weight objects, then there can be a shortage.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>From (2b): Because finalize() is called only once, what if in teh finalize() you had a strong reference to â€œthisâ€ object. Next time the objectâ€™s finalie() is never called hence can leave the object in an inconsistent state.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>If inside finalize() an exception is thrown, it is ignored.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>You do not know when finalize() is called as you have no control over when GC is called. Sometimes it might happen that you are printing the  valueâ€™s in finalize() but the output is never shown, because your program might have got terminated by the time finalize() is called.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence avoid using it. Instead create a method say dispose() which will close the necessory resources or for final log etc.\r\n<a href=\"http://jatinpuri.com/?p=106\" rel=\"nofollow\">the complete post on it</a>.

At a paper poll, each registered voter is restricted to a particular booth/location and verification is done by name+SSN and a signature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You might need a high resolution digital signature capture and therefore a touchscreen capture peripheral or a touch screen terminal.  A more sophisticated approach would be a biometric scanner, but that would require government records of thumb/finger prints or retinal scan - I can already see the privacy advocates lining up at the lawyer\'s offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another approach would be for the voter \"registrar office\" to issue digital keys to each voter prior to the election - a (relatively) short (cryptographically strong) random alpha/numeric key that is entered with the voter\'s name and/or SSN into the application. Knowledge of that key is required for that particular voter in that particular election.  These keys would be issued by post in tamper-evident envelopes, like those used by banks for postal confirmation of wire transfers and delivery of PIN numbers.  The key must include checksum data so that the user can have the entry of it immediately validated and it should be in groups of 4, so something like XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-CCCC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any other \"secret\" knowledge, such as SSN, is likely too easily discovered for a large percentage of the population (though we don\'t seem to be able to make credit-granting organizations understand this), and therefore is unsuitable for authentication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vote counting can be done by generating a public key encrypted data file which is transferred (by sneaker net?) to the central system.  This must include the \"voting booth\" identity information and a record for each voter including their SSN and the digital key (or signature, or biometric data).  Votes with invalid keys are eliminated.  Multiple votes with the same key and same votes are treated as a single vote for that candidate.  Multiple votes with the same key and different votes are flagged for fraud investigation (with the constituent contacted by phone, issued a new key, and directed to revote).</p>\r\n',8946,'Kiwi',NULL,NULL,NULL,'11/1/2008 6:50',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(256156,2,NULL,29357,'11/1/2008 21:44',2,NULL,'<p>My company did lately app with very strong security.

The Java Serialization, like pretty much everything in Javaland, is standardized. So, you <em>could</em> implement a deserializer according to that standard in Python.

While implementing a JVM in Python is surely a fun exercise, it\'s probably not what you\'re looking for (-:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are other (data) serialization formats that are specifically designed to be language agnostic.

If you look on Spring, there are roughly 40k registered users, while Seam has about 7k.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depends on what is important to you, as a Java developer/engineer/programmer, you should be able to work with both technologies and chances are, you will most likely encounter a Spring application before a Seam one.  Learn both and how to leverage both.  If you use both properly and know the nuances and quirks of each, development becomes much easier whether you\'re using Spring or Seam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don\'t agree with the statement, \"Seam is the next Struts\".  Struts was a view technology whereas Seam integrates all layers.  I will agree that it is a new concept like Struts and will bring the same impact to the Java community that Struts did.  I don\'t think we\'ll see that until Java EE 6 and CDI become more popular, and of course Seam 3 is released.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walter</p>\r\n',NULL,'Walter White',NULL,NULL,NULL,'12/31/2009 1:19',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(2833500,2,NULL,30281,'5/14/2010 10:45',0,NULL,'<p>You can also see in the Seam in Production pages to see which sites/organizations uses Seam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://seamframework.org/Community/SeamInProductionListing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Seam in Production page 1</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://seamframework.org/Community/SeamInProductionListing2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Seam in Production page 2</a></p>\r\n',37298,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'5/14/2010 10:45',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(3309674,2,NULL,30281,'7/22/2010 14:02',1,NULL,'<p>I like Seam, have been using it for the past year professionally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the question concerns its popularity.

LATEST refers to the latest released or snapshot version of a particular artifact, the most recently deployed artifact in a particular repository. RELEASE refers to the last non-snapshot release in the repository. In general, it is not a best practice to design software which depends on a non-specific version of an artifact. If you are developing software, you might want to use RELEASE or LATEST as a convenience so that you don\'t have to update version numbers when a new release of a third-party library is released. When you release software, you should always make sure that your project depends on specific versions to reduce the chances of your build or your project being affected by a software release not under your control. Use LATEST and RELEASE with caution, if at all.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>See the <a href=\"http://www.sonatype.com/books/maven-book/reference/pom-relationships-sect-pom-syntax.html#pom-relationships-sect-latest-release\">POM Syntax section of the Maven book</a> for more details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here\'s an example illustrating the various options. In the Maven repository, com.foo:my-foo has the following metadata:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;&lt;metadata&gt;\r\n  &lt;groupId&gt;com.foo&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;my-foo&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n  &lt;version&gt;2.0.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n  &lt;versioning&gt;\r\n    &lt;release&gt;1.1.1&lt;/release&gt;\r\n    &lt;versions&gt;\r\n      &lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n      &lt;version&gt;1.0.1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n      &lt;version&gt;1.1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n      &lt;version&gt;1.1.1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n      &lt;version&gt;2.0.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n    &lt;/versions&gt;\r\n    &lt;lastUpdated&gt;20090722140000&lt;/lastUpdated&gt;\r\n  &lt;/versioning&gt;\r\n&lt;/metadata&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>If a dependency on that artifact is required, you have the following options (other <a href=\"http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVEN/Dependency+Mediation+and+Conflict+Resolution#DependencyMediationandConflictResolution-DependencyVersionRanges\">version ranges</a> can be specified of course, just showing the relevant ones here):</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Declare an exact version (will always resolve to 1.0.1):</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;version&gt;[1.0.1]&lt;/version&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Declare an explicit version (will always resolve to 1.0.1 unless a collision occurs, when Maven will select a matching version):</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;version&gt;1.0.1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Declare a version range for all 1.x (will currently resolve to 1.1.1):</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;version&gt;[1.0.0,2.0.0)&lt;/version&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Declare an open-ended version range (will resolve to 2.0.0):</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;version&gt;[1.0.0,)&lt;/version&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Declare the version as LATEST (will resolve to 2.0.0):</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;version&gt;LATEST&lt;/version&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Declare the version as RELEASE (will resolve to 1.1.1):</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;version&gt;RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that by default your own deployments will update the \"latest\" entry in the Maven metadata, but to update the \"release\" entry, you need to activate the \"release-profile\" from the <a href=\"http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html\">Maven super POM</a>.

Depending on where csvDirPath and csvFileName come from (e.g. csvFileName might come from the name of the file uploaded by a user?), and on how clever the Access JDBC driver is, you could be open to someone breaking or deleting your data by inserting a semicolon (or some brackets to make a subquery) and some additional SQL commands into the query.</li>\r\n<li>You are relying on the columns of the CSV file being compatible with the columns of the Access table. If you have unchecked CSV being uploaded, or if the CSV generator has a particular way of handling nulls, or if you one day get an unusual date or number format, you may get an error on inserting into the Access table.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Having said all that, we are all about pragmatism here. If the above code is from a utility class which you are going to use by hand a few times a week/month/year/ever, then it isn\'t really a problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it is a class which forms part of a web application, then the \'official\' Java way to do it would be to read records out of the CSV file (either using a CSV parser or a CSV/text JDBC driver), get the columns out of the recordset, do some validation or sanity checking on them, and then use a new PreparedStatement to insert them into the Access database. Much more trouble but much more robust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can probably find a combination of tools (e.g. object-relational layers or other data access tools) which will do a lot of that for you, but setting up the tools is going to be as much hassle as writing the code.

Instead, the word â€œtemplatesâ€ is used and is more accurate. Templates describes one <em>technique</em> to achieve a generic design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C++ templates is very different from what both C# and Java implement for two main reasons. The first reason is that C++ templates don\'t only allow compile-time type arguments but also compile-time const-value arguments: templates can be given as integers or even function signatures. This means that you can do some quite funky stuff at compile time, e.g. calculations:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>template &lt;unsigned int N&gt;\r\nstruct product {\r\n    static unsigned int const VALUE = N * product&lt;N - 1&gt;::VALUE;\r\n};\r\n\r\ntemplate &lt;&gt;\r\nstruct product&lt;1&gt; {\r\n    static unsigned int const VALUE = 1;\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Usage:\r\nunsigned int const p5 = product&lt;5&gt;::VALUE;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>This code also uses the other distinguished feature of C++ templates, namely template specialization. The code defines one class template, <code>product</code> that has one value argument. It also defines a specialization for that template that is used whenever the argument evaluates to 1. This allows me to define a recursion over template definitions. I believe that this was first discovered by <a href=\"http://erdani.org/\">Andrei Alexandrescu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Template specialization is important for C++ because it allows for structural differences in data structures. Templates as a whole is a means of unifying an interface across types. However, although this is desirable, all types cannot be treated equally inside the implementation. C++ templates takes this into account. This is very much the same difference that OOP makes between interface and implementation with the overriding of virtual methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C++ templates are essential for its algorithmic programming paradigm. For example, almost all algorithms for containers are defined as functions that accept the container type as a template type and treat them uniformly. Actually, that\'s not quite right: C++ doesn\'t work on containers but rather on <em>ranges</em> that are defined by two iterators, pointing to the beginning and behind the end of the container. Thus, the whole content is circumscribed by the iterators: begin &lt;= elements &lt; end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using iterators instead of containers is useful because it allows to operate on parts of a container instead of on the whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another distinguishing feature of C++ is the possibility of <em>partial specialization</em> for class templates. This is somewhat related to pattern matching on arguments in Haskell and other functional languages. For example, let\'s consider a class that stores elements:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;\r\nclass Store { â€¦ }; // (1)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>This works for any element type. But let\'s say that we can store pointers more effciently than other types by applying some special trick. We can do this by <em>partially</em> specializing for all pointer types:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;\r\nclass Store&lt;T*&gt; { â€¦ }; // (2)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, whenever we instance a container template for one type, the appropriate definition is used:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>Store&lt;int&gt; x; // Uses (1)\r\nStore&lt;int*&gt; y; // Uses (2)\r\nStore&lt;string**&gt; z; // Uses (2), with T = string*.\r\n</code></pre>\r\n',1968,'Konrad Rudolph',485561,NULL,'10/19/2011 1:29','10/19/2011 1:29',NULL,NULL,NULL,4,NULL,NULL,NULL),(31778,2,NULL,31693,'8/28/2008 7:22',1,NULL,'<p>In Java, generics are compiler level only, so you get:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>a = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;()\r\na.getClass() =&gt; ArrayList\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that the type of \'a\' is an array list, not a list of strings.

Because of template specialization, the IDE can never be really sure if a given member exists or not. Consider:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;\r\nstruct X {\r\n    void foo() { }\r\n};\r\n\r\ntemplate &lt;&gt;\r\nstruct X&lt;int&gt; { };\r\n\r\ntypedef int my_int_type;\r\n\r\nX&lt;my_int_type&gt; a;\r\na.|\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the cursor is at the indicated position and it\'s damn hard for the IDE to say at that point if, and what, members <code>a</code> has. For other languages the parsing would be straightforward but for C++, quite a bit of evaluation is needed beforehand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It gets worse. What if <code>my_int_type</code> were defined inside a class template as well? Now its type would depend on another type argument. And here, even compilers fail.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;\r\nstruct Y {\r\n    typedef T my_type;\r\n};\r\n\r\nX&lt;Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type&gt; b;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>After a bit of thinking, a programmer would conclude that this code is the same as the above: <code>Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type</code> resolves to <code>int</code>, therefore <code>b</code> should be the same type as <code>a</code>, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wrong. At the point where the compiler tries to resolve this statement, it doesn\'t actually know <code>Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type</code> yet! Therefore, it doesn\'t know that this is a type. It could be something else, e.g. a member function or a field. This might give rise to ambiguities (though not in the present case), therefore the compiler fails. We have to tell it explicitly that we refer to a type name:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>X&lt;typename Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type&gt; b;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the code compiles.

However, if <code>my_type</code> is not a function but rather a type, this statement would still be valid and perform a special cast (the function-style cast) which is often a constructor invocation. The compiler can\'t tell which we mean so we have to disambiguate here.</p>\r\n',1968,'Konrad Rudolph',1968,'Konrad Rudolph','9/1/2008 9:21','9/1/2008 9:21',NULL,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(31866,2,NULL,31693,'8/28/2008 8:52',6,NULL,'<p>Both Java and C# introduced generics after their first language release.

There\'s no casting or any other stuff, and because the dll contains the information that this is a List of <code>Person</code>, other code that looks at it later on using reflection can tell that it contains <code>Person</code> objects (so you get intellisense and so on).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The downside of this is that old C# 1.0 and 1.1 code (before they added generics) doesn\'t understand these new <code>List&lt;something&gt;</code>, so you have to manually convert things back to plain old <code>List</code> to interoperate with them. This is not that big of a problem, because C# 2.0 binary code is not backwards compatible. The only time this will ever happen is if you\'re upgrading some old C# 1.0/1.1 code to C# 2.0</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Java Generics allow you to declare something like this.</h2>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>ArrayList&lt;Person&gt; foo = new ArrayList&lt;Person&gt;();\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>On the surface it looks the same, and it sort-of is. The compiler will also prevent you from putting things that aren\'t <code>Person</code> into the list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The difference is what happens behind the scenes. Unlike C#, Java does not go and build a special <code>ListOfPerson</code> - it just uses the plain old <code>ArrayList</code> which has always been in Java. When you get things out of the array, the usual <code>Person p = (Person)foo.get(1);</code> casting-dance still has to be done. The compiler is saving you the key-presses, but the speed hit/casting is still incurred just like it always was.<br>\r\nWhen people mention \"Type Erasure\" this is what they\'re talking about. The compiler inserts the casts for you, and then \'erases\' the fact that it\'s meant to be a list of <code>Person</code> not just <code>Object</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The benefit of this approach is that old code which doesn\'t understand generics doesn\'t have to care. It\'s still dealing with the same old <code>ArrayList</code> as it always has. This is more important in the java world because they wanted to support compiling code using Java 5 with generics, and having it run on old 1.4 or previous JVM\'s, which microsoft deliberately decided not to bother with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The downside is the speed hit I mentioned previously, and also because there is no <code>ListOfPerson</code> pseudo-class or anything like that going into the .class files, code that looks at it later on (with reflection, or if you pull it out of another collection where it\'s been converted into <code>Object</code> or so on) can\'t tell in any way that it\'s meant to be a list containing only <code>Person</code> and not just any other array list.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>C++ Templates allow you to declare something like this</h2>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>std::list&lt;Person&gt;* foo = new std::list&lt;Person&gt;();\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>It looks like C# and Java generics, and it will do what you think it should do, but behind the scenes different things are happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has the most in common with C# generics in that it builds special <code>pseudo-classes</code> rather than just throwing the type information away like java does, but it\'s a whole different kettle of fish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both C# and Java produce output which is designed for virtual machines. If you write some code which has a <code>Person</code> class in it, in both cases some information about a <code>Person</code> class will go into the .dll or .class file, and the JVM/CLR will do stuff with this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C++ produces raw x86 binary code. Everything is <em>not</em> an object, and there\'s no underlying virtual machine which needs to know about a <code>Person</code> class. There\'s no boxing or unboxing, and functions don\'t have to belong to classes, or indeed anything. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of this, the C++ compiler places no restrictions on what you can do with templates - basically any code you could write manually, you can get templates to write for you.<br>\r\nThe most obvious example is adding things:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In C# and Java, the generics system needs to know what methods are available for a class, and it needs to pass this down to the virtual machine. The only way to tell it this is by either hard-coding the actual class in, or using interfaces. For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>int addNames&lt;T&gt;( T first, T second ) { return first.Name() + second.Name(); }\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>That code won\'t compile in C# or Java, because it doesn\'t know that the type <code>T</code> actually provides a method called Name(). You have to tell it - in C# like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>interface IHasName{ string Name(); };\r\nint addNames&lt;T&gt;( T first, T second ) where T : IHasName { .... }\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>And then you have to make sure the things you pass to addNames implement the IHasName interface and so on. The java syntax is different (<code>&lt;T extends IHasName&gt;</code>), but it suffers from the same problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The \'classic\' case for this problem is trying to write a function which does this</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>int addNames&lt;T&gt;( T first, T second ) { return first + second; }\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>You can\'t actually write this code because there are no ways to declare an interface with the <code>+</code> method in it. You fail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C++ suffers from none of these problems. The compiler doesn\'t care about passing types down to any VM\'s - if both your objects have a .Name() function, it will compile. If they don\'t, it won\'t.

However, the question is: why would anyone do that? It doesn\'t make sense! Or does it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, what\'s the alternative? If you don\'t implement generics in the language, where <em>do</em> you implement them? And the answer is: in the Virtual Machine. Which breaks backwards compatibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Type erasure, on the other hand, allows you to mix generic clients with non-generic libraries. In other words: code that was compiled on Java 5 can still be deployed to Java 1.4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Microsoft, however, decided to break backwards compatibility for generics. <em>That\'s</em> why .NET Generics are \"better\" than Java Generics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, Sun aren\'t idiots or cowards. The reason why they \"chickened out\", was that Java was significantly older and more widespread than .NET when they introduced generics. (They were introduced roughly at the same time in both worlds.) Breaking backwards compatibility would have been a huge pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Put yet another way: in Java, Generics are a part of the <em>Language</em> (which means they apply <em>only</em> to Java, not to other languages), in .NET they are part of the <em>Virtual Machine</em> (which means they apply to <em>all</em> languages, not just C# and Visual Basic.NET).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compare this with .NET features like LINQ, lambda expressions, local variable type inference, anonymous types and expression trees: these are all <em>language</em> features. That\'s why there are subtle differences between VB.NET and C#: if those features were part of the VM, they would be the same in <em>all</em> languages. But the CLR hasn\'t changed: it\'s still the same in .NET 3.5 SP1 as it was in .NET 2.0. You can compile a C# program that uses LINQ with the .NET 3.5 compiler and still run it on .NET 2.0, provided that you don\'t use any .NET 3.5 libraries.

Both the generic and non-generic lists are still available in .Net framework 2.0 even until 4.0, exactly for nothing else but backward compatibility reason. Therefore old codes that still used non-generic ArrayList will still work, and use the same ArrayList class as before.\r\nBackward code compatibility is always maintained since 1.0 till now...

If the component isn\'t something complex like a UIData, it won\'t do much except call its own <em>decode</em> method. The <em>decode</em> method doesn\'t do much except find its renderer and invokes its <em>decode</em> method, passing itself as an argument. It is the renderer\'s job to get any submitted value and set it via <em>setSubmittedValue</em>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Process Validations</strong>. This phase calls <em>processValidators</em> which will call <em>validate</em>. The <em>validate</em> method takes the submitted value, converts it with any converters, validates it with any validators and (assuming the data passes those tests) calls <em>setValue</em>. This will store the value as a local variable. While this local variable is not null, it will be returned and not the value from the value binding for any calls to <em>getValue</em>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Update Model Values</strong>. This phase calls <em>processUpdates</em>. In an input component, this will call <em>updateModel</em> which will get the <em>ValueExpression</em> and invoke it to set the value on the model.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Invoke Application</strong>. Button event listeners and so on will be invoked here (as will navigation if memory serves).</li>\r\n<li><strong>Render Response</strong>. The tree is rendered via the renderers and the state saved.</li>\r\n<li>If any of these phases fail (e.g. a value is invalid), the lifecycle skips to Render Response.</li>\r\n<li>Various events can be fired after most of these phases, invoking listeners as appropriate (like value change listeners after Process Validations).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a somewhat simplified version of events.

Basically, you have to consider the exceptions that the code you call may throw, and in turn you\'ll consider the exceptions you\'ll throw for the code that calls yours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) It gives you the opportunity to add additional debugging information into the exception chain. For instance, if you have a method that throws an exception on a duplicate username, you might wrap that exception with one that includes additional information about the circumstances of the failure (for example, the IP of the request that provided the dupe username) that wasn\'t available to the lower-level code. The cookie trail of exceptions may help you debug a complex problem (it certainly has for me).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3) It lets you become implementation-independent from the lower level code. If you\'re wrapping exceptions and need to swap out Hibernate for some other ORM, you only have to change your Hibernate-handling code. All the other layers of code will still be successfully using the wrapped exceptions and will interpret them in the same way, even though the underlying circumstances have changed. Note that this applies even if Hibernate changes in some way (ex: they switch exceptions in a new version); it\'s not just for wholesale technology replacement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4) It encourages you use different classes of exceptions to represent different situations. For example, you may have a DuplicateUsernameException when the user tries to reuse a username, and a DatabaseFailureException when you can\'t check for dupe usernames due to a broken DB connection. This, in turn, lets you answer your question (\"how do I recover?\") in flexible and powerful ways. If you get a DuplicateUsernameException, you may decide to suggest a different username to the user. If you get a DatabaseFailureException, you may let it bubble up to the point where it displays a \"down for maintenance\" page to the user and send off a notification email to you. Once you have custom exceptions, you have customizeable responses -- and that\'s a good thing.</p>\r\n',3488,'Kanook',3488,NULL,'5/25/2010 20:29','5/25/2010 20:29',NULL,NULL,NULL,2,NULL,NULL,NULL),(33651,2,NULL,33497,'8/28/2008 23:36',0,NULL,'<p>You can catch unchecked exceptions without needing to wrap them.

It may be that such errors\r\n  must be serialized and re-constituted\r\n  for this to happen.

In Java they are basically syntactic sugar to minimize boilerplate casting of Objects.  Here is a pretty decent <a href=\"http://www.mindview.net/WebLog/log-0061\">introduction to C++ templates vs Java generics</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To elaborate on this point: when you use a C++ template, you\'re basically creating another copy of the code, just as if you used a <code>#define</code> macro.  This allows you to do things like have <code>int</code> parameters in template definitions that determine sizes of arrays and such.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Java doesn\'t work like that.  In Java all objects extent from <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html\">java.lang.Object</a> so, pre-Generics, you\'d write code like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>public class PhoneNumbers {\r\n  private Map phoneNumbers = new HashMap();\r\n\r\n  public String getPhoneNumber(String name) {\r\n    return (String)phoneNumbers.get(name);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>because all the Java collection types used Object as their base type so you could put anything in them.  Java 5 rolls around and adds generics so you can do things like:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>public class PhoneNumbers {\r\n  private Map&lt;String, String&gt; phoneNumbers = new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;();\r\n\r\n  public String getPhoneNumber(String name) {\r\n    return phoneNumbers.get(name);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>And that\'s all Java Generics are: wrappers for casting objects.  That\'s because Java Generics aren\'t reified.  They use type erasure.  This decision was made because Java Generics came along so late in the piece that they didn\'t want to break backward compatibility (a <code>Map&lt;String, String&gt;</code> is usable whenever a <code>Map</code> is called for).  Compare this to .Net/C# where type erasure isn\'t used, which leads to all sorts of differences (eg you can use primitive types and <code>IEnumerable</code> and <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> bear no relation to each other).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And a class using generics compiled with a Java 5+ compiler is usable no JDK 1.4 (assuming it doesn\'t use any ohter features or classes that require Java 5+).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That\'s why Java Generics are called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar\">syntactic sugar</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this decision on how to do generics has profound effects so much so that the (superb) <a href=\"http://www.angelikalanger.com/GenericsFAQ/JavaGenericsFAQ.html\">Java Generics FAQ</a> has sprung up to answer the many, many questions people have about Java Generics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C++ templates have a number of features that Java Generics don\'t:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Use of primitive type arguments.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>template&lt;class T, int i&gt;\r\nclass Matrix {\r\n  int T[i][i];\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Use of <a href=\"http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc/language/ref/default_args_for_templ_params.htm\">default type arguments</a>, which is one feature I miss in Java but there are backwards compatibility reasons for this;</li>\r\n<li>C++ allows the use of primitive type arguments, Java doesn\'t; and</li>\r\n<li>Java allows bounding of arguments.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>public class ObservableList&lt;T extends List&gt; {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>It really does need to be stressed that template invocations with different arguments really are different types.

But this is often\r\n  difficult to know. So as a general\r\n  rule, <strong>if you have no particular\r\n  logic for using notify(), then you\r\n  should probably use notifyAll()</strong>,\r\n  because it is often difficult to know\r\n  exactly what threads will be waiting\r\n  on a particular object and why.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n',2108,'andyuk',NULL,NULL,NULL,'8/31/2008 19:25',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(37046,2,NULL,37026,'8/31/2008 19:25',70,NULL,'<p>Simply put, it depends on why your threads are waiting to be notified.

The Android SDK doesn\'t provide a direct method to change the indicator of a <code>TabHost</code> after it\'s been created.  The <code>TabSpec</code> is only used to build the tab, so changing the <code>TabSpec</code> after the fact will have no effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think there\'s a workaround, though.  Call <code>mTabs.getTabWidget()</code> to get a <code>TabWidget</code> object.  This is just a subclass of <code>ViewGroup</code>, so you can call <code>getChildCount()</code> and <code>getChildAt()</code> to access individual tabs within the <code>TabWidget</code>.  Each of these tabs is also a View, and in the case of a tab with a graphical indicator and a text label, it\'s almost certainly some other <code>ViewGroup</code> (maybe a <code>LinearLayout</code>, but it doesn\'t matter) that contains an <code>ImageView</code> and a <code>TextView</code>.  So with a little fiddling with the debugger or <code>Log.i</code>, you should be able to figure out a recipe to get the <code>ImageView</code> and change it directly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The downside is that if you\'re not careful, the exact layout of the controls within a tab could change and your app could break.

Consumer 2 (C2) is about to enter the synchronized method (at point Y above), but Producer P1 puts an object in the buffer, and subsequently calls <code>notify</code>. The only waiting thread is C1, so it is woken and now attempts to re-acquire the object lock at point X (above).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now C1 and C2 are attempting to acquire the synchronization lock. One of them (nondeterministically) is chosen and enters the method, the other is blocked (not waiting - but blocked, trying to acquire the lock on the method). Let\'s say C2 gets the lock first. C1 is still blocking (trying to acquire the lock at X). C2 completes the method and releases the lock. Now, C1 acquires the lock. Guess what, lucky we have a <code>while</code> loop, because, C1 performs the loop check (guard) and is prevented from removing a non-existent element from the buffer (C2 already got it!). If we didn\'t have a <code>while</code>, we would get an <code>IndexArrayOutOfBoundsException</code> as C1 tries to remove the first element from the buffer!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOW,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ok, now why do we need notifyAll?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the producer/consumer example above it looks like we can get away with <code>notify</code>. It seems this way, because we can prove that the guards on the <em>wait</em> loops for producer and consumer are mutually exclusive. That is, it looks like we cannot have a thread waiting in the <code>put</code> method as well as the <code>get</code> method, because, for that to be true, then the following would have to be true:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><code>buf.size() == 0 AND buf.size() == MAX_SIZE</code> (assume MAX_SIZE is not 0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HOWEVER, this is not good enough, we NEED to use <code>notifyAll</code>. Let\'s see why ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Assume we have a buffer of size 1 (to make the example easy to follow). The following steps lead us to deadlock. Note that ANYTIME a thread is woken with notify, it can be non-deterministically selected by the JVM - that is any waiting thread can be woken. Also note that when multiple threads are blocking on entry to a method (i.e. trying to acquire a lock), the order of acquisition can be non-deterministic.

In Windows 32 bit this is around 2gb (not specifically heap but total amount of memory per process). It just happens that Java happens to make the default smaller (presumably so that the programmer can\'t create programs that have runaway memory allocation without running into this problem and having to examine exactly what they are doing).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So this given there are several approaches you could take to either determine what amount of memory you need or to reduce the amount of memory you are using. One common mistake with garbage collected languages such as Java or C# is to keep around references to objects that you no longer are using, or allocating many objects when you could reuse them instead. As long as objects have a reference to them they will continue to use heap space as the garbage collector will not delete them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case you can use a Java memory profiler to determine what methods in your program are allocating large number of objects and then determine if there is a way to make sure they are no longer referenced, or to not allocate them in the first place. One option which I have used in the past is \"JMP\" <a href=\"http://www.khelekore.org/jmp/\">http://www.khelekore.org/jmp/</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you determine that you are allocating these objects for a reason and you need to keep around references (depending on what you are doing this might be the case), you will just need to increase the max heap size when you start the program. However, once you do the memory profiling and understand how your objects are getting allocated you should have a better idea about how much memory you need. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general if you can\'t guarantee that your program will run in some finite amount of memory (perhaps depending on input size) you will always run into this problem. Only after exhausting all of this will you need to look into caching objects out to disk etc. At this point you should have a very good reason to say \"I need Xgb of memory\" for something and you can\'t work around it by improving your algorithms or memory allocation patterns. Generally this will only usually be the case for algorithms operating on large datasets (like a database or some scientific analysis program) and then techniques like caching and memory mapped IO become useful.</p>\r\n',2925,'Ben Childs',NULL,NULL,NULL,'9/1/2008 1:29',NULL,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(37998,2,NULL,37089,'9/1/2008 14:28',0,NULL,'<p>I would have a look at the Parallel extensions to the .NET framework.

Java\'s static typing system isn\'t really designed to support this unless the object conforms to a known interface, but using reflection, your code can look at the object and find out if it has a method called \'doSomething\', and then, call it if you want to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, to give you a code example of this in Java (imagine the object in question is foo) :</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>Method method = foo.getClass().getMethod(\"doSomething\", null);\r\nmethod.invoke(foo, null);\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>One very common use case in Java is the usage with annotations.

This shows you what objects are using the most memory. But the objects aren\'t lumped together solely by type: each entry also includes a \"trace\" ID. You can then search for that \"TRACE nnnn\" to see the top few frames of the stack where the object was allocated. Often, once I see where the object is allocated, I find a bug and I\'m done. Also, note that you can control how many frames are recorded in the stack with the options to -Xrunhprof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you check out the allocation site, and don\'t see anything wrong, you have to start backward chaining from some of those live objects to root objects, to find the unexpected reference chain. This is where a tool really helps, but you can do the same thing by hand (well, with grep). There is not just one root object (i.e., object not subject to garbage collection). Threads, classes, and stack frames act as root objects, and anything they reference strongly is not collectible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To do the chaining, look in the HEAP DUMP section for entries with the bad trace id. This will take you to an OBJ or ARR entry, which shows a unique object identifier in hexadecimal. Search for all occurrences of that id to find who\'s got a strong reference to the object.

It doesn\'t send the headers to the server until you\'ve gotten one of the streams.  If you just get the input stream then I believe it does a GET, sends the headers, then lets you read the output.  If you get the output stream then I believe it sends it as a POST, as it assumes you\'ll be writing data to it (You may need to call setDoOutput(true) for the output stream to work).

If the server specifies a content length then URLConnection will keep the underlying input stream open until it receives that much data, <em>even if you explicitly close it</em>.  This caused a lot of problems for us as it made shutting our client down cleanly a bit hard, as the URLConnection would keep the network connection open.

Then java has objects (everything that derives from <code>java.lang.Object</code>). Objects are actually always handled through a reference (a reference being a pointer that you can\'t touch). That means that in effect, objects are passed by value, as the references are normally not interesting. It does however mean that you cannot change which object is pointed to as the reference itself is passed by value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does this sound strange and confusing? Let\'s consider how C implements pass by reference and pass by value. In C the default convention is pass by value. <code>void foo(int x)</code> passes an int by value. <code>void foo(int *x)</code> is a function that does not want an <code>int a</code>, but a pointer to an int: <code>foo(&amp;a)</code>. One would use this with the <code>&amp;</code> operator to pass a variable address.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take this to C++, and we have references. References are basically (in this context) syntactic sugar that hide the pointer part of the equation: <code>void foo(int &amp;x)</code> is called by <code>foo(a)</code>, where the compiler itself knows that it is a reference and the address of the non-reference <code>a</code> should be passed. In java, all variables referring to objects are actually of reference type, in effect forcing call by reference for most intends and purposes without the fine grained control (and complexity) afforded by e.g. C++.</p>\r\n',4100,'Paul de Vrieze',NULL,NULL,NULL,'9/2/2008 20:53',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'9/14/2012 18:22'),(65645,2,NULL,40242,'9/15/2008 18:52',0,NULL,'<p>Iteratively refactor.

The character \"#\" is unsafe and should\r\n    always be encoded because it is used in World Wide Web and in other\r\n    systems to delimit a URL from a fragment/anchor identifier that might\r\n    follow it.

Other characters are unsafe because\r\n    gateways and other transport agents are known to sometimes modify\r\n    such characters.

Once these are cleaned up, you can continue finding pages with more and more imports, until finally you have refactored the imports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When refactoring, note the parts that try to access resources not given to the page and try to take this out to a controller.  For instance, anything that accesses the database should be inside a controller, let the JSP handle the display of the information the controller gives to it via a forward.  In this way you will develop several servlets, or things like servlets, for each page.  I would suggest using a front-controller based framework for this refactoring (from personal experience I recommend Spring and its Controller interface), so that each controller isn\'t a separate Servlet but is rather delegated to from a single servlet that is mapped appropriately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the controller, it is better to do database hits all at once rather than attempt them piecemeal.  Users can and generally do tolerate a page load, but the page output will be much faster if all the database data is given to the rendering code rather than the rendering code hanging and not giving data to the client while it is trying to read yet another piece of data from the database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I feel your pain and wish you luck in this endeavor.

While some processors include the\r\n  instructions for their predecessors,\r\n  it\'s generally true that a program\r\n  that runs on one kind of computer\r\n  won\'t run on any other. Add in the\r\n  services provided by the operating\r\n  system, which each system describes in\r\n  its own unique way, and you have a\r\n  compatibility problem. In general, you\r\n  can\'t write and compile a program for\r\n  one kind of system and run it on any\r\n  other without a lot of work. Java gets\r\n  around this limitation by inserting\r\n  its virtual machine between the\r\n  application and the real environment\r\n  (computer + operating system). If an\r\n  application is compiled to Java byte\r\n  code and that byte code is interpreted\r\n  the same way in every environment then\r\n  you can write a single program which\r\n  will work on all the different\r\n  platforms where Java is supported.\r\n  (That\'s the theory, anyway. In\r\n  practice there are always small\r\n  incompatibilities lying in wait for\r\n  the programmer.)</p></li>\r\n  <li><p><strong>Security</strong>: One of Java\'s virtues is its integration into the Web. Load\r\n  a web page that uses Java into your\r\n  browser and the Java code is\r\n  automatically downloaded and executed.\r\n  But what if the code destroys files,\r\n  whether through malice or sloppiness\r\n  on the programmer\'s part? Java\r\n  prevents downloaded applets from doing\r\n  anything destructive by disallowing\r\n  potentially dangerous operations.\r\n  Before it allows the code to run it\r\n  examines it for attempts to bypass\r\n  security. It verifies that data is\r\n  used consistently: code that\r\n  manipulates a data item as an integer\r\n  at one stage and then tries to use it\r\n  as a pointer later will be caught and\r\n  prevented from executing. (The Java\r\n  language doesn\'t allow pointer\r\n  arithmetic, so you can\'t write Java\r\n  code to do what we just described.\r\n  However, there is nothing to prevent\r\n  someone from writing destructive byte\r\n  code themselves using a hexadecimal\r\n  editor or even building a Java byte\r\n  code assembler.) It generally isn\'t\r\n  possible to analyze a program\'s\r\n  machine code before execution and\r\n  determine whether it does anything\r\n  bad. Tricks like writing\r\n  self-modifying code mean that the evil\r\n  operations may not even exist until\r\n  later. But Java byte code was designed\r\n  for this kind of validation: it\r\n  doesn\'t have the instructions a\r\n  malicious programmer would use to hide\r\n  their assault.</p></li>\r\n  <li><p><strong>Size</strong>: In the microprocessor world RISC is generally preferable\r\n  over CISC. It\'s better to have a small\r\n  instruction set and use many fast\r\n  instructions to do a job than to have\r\n  many complex operations implemented as\r\n  single instructions. RISC designs\r\n  require fewer gates on the chip to\r\n  implement their instructions, allowing\r\n  for more room for pipelines and other\r\n  techniques to make each instruction\r\n  faster. In an interpreter, however,\r\n  none of this matters. If you want to\r\n  implement a single instruction for the\r\n  switch statement with a variable\r\n  length depending on the number of case\r\n  clauses, there\'s no reason not to do\r\n  so. In fact, a complex instruction set\r\n  is an advantage for a web-based\r\n  language: it means that the same\r\n  program will be smaller (fewer\r\n  instructions of greater complexity),\r\n  which means less time to transfer\r\n  across our speed-limited network.</p></li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>So when considering byte code vs native, consider which trade-offs you want to make between portability, security, size, and execution speed. If speed is the only important factor, go native. If any of the others are more important, go with bytecode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\'ll also add that maintaining a series of OS and architecture-targeted compilations of the same code base for every release can become very tedious.

I really didn\'t want to like write a windows service.  I felt like that was out of band code. Plus the code that actually does the work is a web page in fact, because to me that is a logical unit of work on a website is a web page.  So, it really is like we are calling back into the web site, it\'s just like another request in the website, so I viewed it as something that should stay inline, and the little approach that we came up that was recommended to me on Twitter was to essentially to add something to the application cache with a fixed expiration, then you have a call back so when that expires it calls a certain function which does the work then you add it back in to the cache with the same expiration.  So, it\'s a little bit, maybe \"ghetto\" is the right word.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>My approach has always been to have to OS (i.e. Cron or the Windows task scheduler) load a specific URL at some interval, and then setup a page at that URL to check it\'s queue, and perform whatever tasks were required, but I\'d be interested to hear if there\'s a better way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the transcript, it looks like FogBugz uses the windows service loading a URL approach also.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p>Spolsky: So we have this special page called heartbeat.asp.  And that page, whenever you hit it, and anybody can hit it at anytime: doesn\'t hurt.  But when that page runs it checks a queue of waiting tasks to see if there\'s anything that needs to be done.  And if there\'s anything that needs to be done, it does one thing and then looks in that queue again and if there\'s anything else to be done it returns a plus, and the entire web page that it returns is just a single character with a plus in it.  And if there\'s nothing else to be done, the queue is now empty, it returns a minus.  So, anybody can call this and hit it as many times, you can load up heartbeat.asp in your web browser you hit Ctrl-R Ctrl-R Ctrl-R Ctrl-R until you start getting minuses instead of pluses.  And when you\'ve done that FogBugz will have completed all of its maintenance work that it needs to do.  So that\'s the first part, and the second part is a very, very simple Windows service which runs, and its whole job is to call heartbeat.asp and if it gets a plus, call it again soon, and if it gets a minus call it again, but not for a while.  So basically there\'s this Windows service that\'s always running, that has a very, very, very simple task of just hitting a URL, and looking to see if it gets a plus or a minus and, and then scheduling when it runs again based on whether it got a plus or a minus.  And obviously you can do any kind of variation you want on this theme, like for example, uh you could actually, instead of returning just a plus or minus you could say \"Okay call me back in 60 seconds\" or \"Call me back right away I have more work to be done.\"  And that\'s how it works... so that maintenance service it just runs, you know, it\'s like, you know, a half page of code that runs that maintenance service, and it never has to change, and it doesn\'t have any of the logic in there, it just contains the tickling that causes these web pages to get called with a certain guaranteed frequency.  And inside that web page at heartbeat.asp there\'s code that maintains a queue of tasks that need to be done and looks at how much time has elapsed and does, you know, late-night maintenance and every seven days delete all the older messages that have been marked as spam and all kinds of just maintenance background tasks.

Once a row is loaded from the DB, any subsequent fetches for a row with the same PK will return the data from this cache. Furthermore, Hibernate gaurentees reference equality for objects with the same PK in a single Session. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>From what I understand, your read-only server application never closes its Hibernate session. So when the DB gets updated by the read-write application, the Session on read-only server is unaware of the change. Effectively, your read-only application is loading an in-memory copy of the database and using that copy, which gets stale in due course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The simplest and best course of action I can suggest is to close and open Sessions as needed. This sidesteps the whole problem. Hibernate Sessions are intended to be a window for a short-lived interaction with the DB. I agree that there is a performance gain by not reloading the object-graph again and again; but you need to measure it and convince yourself that it is worth the pains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another option is to close and reopen the Session periodically. This ensures that the read-only application works with data not older than a given time interval. But there definitely is a window where the read-only application works with stale data (although the design guarantees that it gets the up-to-date data eventually). This might be permissible in many applications - you need to evaluate your situation. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third option is to use a <i>second level cache</i> implementation, and use short-lived Sessions.

Beaten to the punch by a Google search.  Unfortunately it\'s true there is no easy way to create draggable tab panes (or any other components) in Swing.  So whilst the example above is complete this one I\'ve just written is a bit simpler. So it will hopefully demonstrate the more advanced techniques involved a bit clearer.  The steps are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Detect that a drag has occurred</li>\r\n<li>Draw the dragged tab to an offscreen buffer</li>\r\n<li>Track the mouse position whilst dragging occurs</li>\r\n<li>Draw the tab in the buffer on top of the component.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The above example will give you what you want but if you want to really understand the techniques applied here it might be a better exercise to round off the edges of this example and add the extra features demonstrated above to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or maybe I\'m just disappointed because I spent time

The best two technologies available for you for the .NET client are Microsoft Web Service Enhancements (WSE) and Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). WSE is an older technology that is no longer being updated by Microsoft, but still works great in Visual Studio 2005 and older. I find WSE to be a bit easier to get started with in terms of how you interface with basic services, but WCF has much more support for WS-* protocols (security, trust, etc.). If your needs are basic and you\'re still using Visual Studio 2005 (.NET framework 2 or older), then go with WSE. If you like the cutting edge, or you anticipate more advanced security needs (doesn\'t sound like you will), then go with WCF. Please note that WSE will not work easily in Visual Studio 2008 and newer, and WCF will not work in Visual Studio 2005 and older.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Going the web service route will mean that you will design to an interface that can be reused and will result in a more loosely coupled system when you\'re done than most of the other routes.

The rules and conventions for naming your variables can be summarized as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>Variable names are case-sensitive. A variable\'s name can be any legal identifier â€” an unlimited-length sequence of Unicode letters and digits, beginning with a letter, the dollar sign \"$\", or the underscore character \"_\". The convention, however, is to always begin your variable names with a letter, not \"$\" or \"_\". Additionally, the dollar sign character, by convention, is never used at all. You may find some situations where auto-generated names will contain the dollar sign, but your variable names should always avoid using it. A similar convention exists for the underscore character; while it\'s technically legal to begin your variable\'s name with \"_\", this practice is discouraged. White space is not permitted.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscore characters. Conventions (and common sense) apply to this rule as well. When choosing a name for your variables, use full words instead of cryptic abbreviations. Doing so will make your code easier to read and understand. In many cases it will also make your code self-documenting; fields named cadence, speed, and gear, for example, are much more intuitive than abbreviated versions, such as s, c, and g. Also keep in mind that the name you choose must not be a keyword or reserved word.</p></li>\r\n<li><p>If the name you choose consists of only one word, spell that word in all lowercase letters. If it consists of more than one word, capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word. The names gearRatio and currentGear are prime examples of this convention. If your variable stores a constant value, such as <code>static final int NUM_GEARS = 6</code>, the convention changes slightly, capitalizing every letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore character. By convention, the underscore character is never used elsewhere. </p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>From the official Java Tutorial</p>\r\n',3221,'bosnic',1887174,NULL,'6/25/2013 15:34','6/25/2013 15:34',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(65781,2,NULL,65668,'9/15/2008 19:08',0,NULL,'<p>When you concatenate two strings, you actually create a third String object in Java.

Just change them via reflection and the VM will crash sooner or later.</li>\r\n<li>All VMs have bugs, so you just have to trigger one.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>For the last method I have a short example, which will crash a Sun Hotspot VM quiet nicely:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>public class Crash {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Object[] o = null;\r\n\r\n        while (true) {\r\n            o = new Object[] {o};\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>This leads to a stack overflow in the GC so you will get no StackOverflowError but a real crash including a hs_err* file.</p>\r\n',13107,'ralfs',NULL,NULL,NULL,'9/16/2008 17:24',NULL,NULL,NULL,5,NULL,NULL,NULL),(85197,2,NULL,53387,'9/17/2008 16:45',-1,NULL,'<p>If \"/\" is not accessible it means that there is no \"index.html\", \"index.jsp\" or whatever is defined in the welcome-files list of the web.xml\r\nAlso no Servlet-Mapping for the context ROOT directory is present.\r\nCheck the web.xml for Servlet-Mappings or try to figure out the name of the jsp/html /... file being in the context root</p>\r\n',15254,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'9/17/2008 16:45',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(74867,2,NULL,65200,'9/16/2008 17:34',1,NULL,'<p>If you define a crash as an process abort because of a unhandled situation (i.e. no Java Exception or Error), then this can not be done from within Java.

Another source could be illegal machine instructions (opcodes) or unhandled signals from library or kernel calls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JVMs (the native code) can have bugs. For example JITed (generated) code, native methods or system calls (graphics driver) can have problems leading to real crashes. In those cases the crash handler of the JVM kicks in and dumps the state. It could also generate a OS core file (Dr. Watson on Windows and core dump on *nix).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Linux/Unix you can easyly make a JVM crash by sending it a Signal to the running process. Note: you should not use <code>SIGSEGV</code> for this, since Hotspot catches this signal and re-throws it as a NullPointerException in most places. So it is better to send a <code>SIGBUS</code> for example.</p>\r\n',13189,'eckes',13189,NULL,'11/16/2011 3:49','11/16/2011 3:49',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(69050,2,NULL,42828,'9/16/2008 3:00',0,NULL,'<p>Create a custom JSP tag handler.

You can assign a pointer, pass the pointer to a method, follow the pointer in the method and change the data that was pointed to. However, you cannot change where that pointer points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In C++, Ada, Pascal and other languages that support pass-by-reference, you can actually change the variable that was passed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Java had pass-by-reference semantics, the <code>foo</code> method we defined above would have changed where <code>myDog</code> was pointing when it assigned <code>someDog</code> on line BBB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think of reference parameters as being aliases for the variable passed in.

Because most types of data can be represented as XML, XQuery can also be used to query other types of data. For example, XQuery can be used to query relational data using an XML view of a relational database. This is important because many Internet applications need to integrate information from multiple sources, including data found in web messages, relational data, and various XML sources. XQuery was specifically designed for this kind of data integration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, suppose your company is a financial institution that needs to produce reports of stock holdings for each client. A client requests a report with a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) message, which is represented in XML. In most businesses, the stock holdings data is stored in multiple relational databases, such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, or DB2. XQuery can query both the SOAP message and the relational databases, creating a report in XML.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>XQuery is based on the structure of XML and leverages that structure to make it possible to perform queries on any type of data that can be represented as XML, including relational data. In addition, XQuery API for Java (XQJ) lets your queries run in any environment that supports the J2EE platform.</p>\r\n',18863,'Siddharth Gaur',NULL,NULL,NULL,'9/22/2008 13:19',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(138198,2,NULL,53387,'9/26/2008 7:48',2,NULL,'<p>The second app (the directory named WebRoot) can also be deployed correctly but you get a 404 by going to it because there is not an \"index.jsp\" or \"index.html\" file in the root directory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try putting a file there with any of those names, and the 404 is gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A servlet mapping in the web.xml is not strictly necessary for this to work. </p>\r\n',22263,'Tom De Leu',NULL,NULL,NULL,'9/26/2008 7:48',NULL,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(115153,2,NULL,43157,'9/22/2008 14:30',16,NULL,'<p>The new NIO package (in the JDK) abstracts this a bit with the new transferFrom and transferTo methods.

I got downvoted for mentioning the fact that strings are immutable types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is an example of why Format() would be dumb as an instance method. In .NET (and probably in Java), Replace() is an instance method.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can do this:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code> \"I Like Wine\".Replace(\"Wine\",\"Beer\");\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>However, nothing happens, because Strings are immutable. Replace tries to return a new string, but it is assigned to nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This causes lots of common rookie mistakes like:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>// Contrived Example\r\ninputText.Replace(\" \",\"%20\");\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, nothing happens, instead you have to do :</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>inputText = inputText.Replace(\" \",\"%20\");\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, if you understand that strings are immutable, that makes perfect sense. If you don\'t, then you are just confused. The proper place for Replace, would be where Format is, as a static method of String:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code> inputText = String.Replace(inputText,\" \", \"%20\");\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Now there is no question as to whats going on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The real question is, why did the authors of these frameworks decide that one should be an instance method, and the other static?

The first was the object wrapping which needed the ability to specify that it was being used for a client to server connection vs. being used for a server to client callback.  Using an extension of <code>UnicastRemoteObject</code> gave us the ability to specify the client and server socket factories that we wanted to use.  However, the best place to lock down the socket factories is in the constructor of the remote object.  </p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>public class RemoteObjectWrapped extends UnicastRemoteObject {\r\n// ....\r\nprivate RemoteObjectWrapped(final boolean callback) throws RemoteException {\r\n  super((callback ? RemoteConnectionParameters.getCallbackPort() : RemoteConnectionParameters.getServerSidePort()),\r\n        (callback ? CALLBACK_CLIENT_SOCKET_FACTORY : CLIENT_SOCKET_FACTORY),\r\n        (callback ? CALLBACK_SERVER_SOCKET_FACTORY : SERVER_SOCKET_FACTORY));\r\n}\r\n// ....\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the first argument specifies the part on which the object is expecting requests, whereas the second and third specify the socket factories that will be used at either end of the connection driving this remote object.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since we wanted to restrict the ports used by the connection, we needed to extend the RMI socket factories and lock down the ports.  Here are some sketches of our server and client factories:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>public class SpecifiedServerSocketFactory implements RMIServerSocketFactory {\r\n/** Always use this port when specified. */\r\nprivate int serverPort;\r\n/**\r\n * @param ignoredPort This port is ignored.  \r\n * @return a {@link ServerSocket} if we managed to create one on the correct port.\r\n * @throws java.io.IOException\r\n */\r\n@Override\r\npublic ServerSocket createServerSocket(final int ignoredPort) throws IOException {\r\n    try {\r\n        final ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(this.serverPort);\r\n        return serverSocket;\r\n    } catch (IOException ioe) {\r\n        throw new IOException(\"Failed to open server socket on port \" + serverPort, ioe);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n// ....\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that the server socket factory above ensures that only the port that you previously specified will ever be used by this factory.  The client socket factory has to be paired with the appropriate socket factory (or you\'ll never connect).</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>public class SpecifiedClientSocketFactory implements RMIClientSocketFactory, Serializable {\r\n/** Serialization hint */\r\npublic static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\r\n/** This is the remote port to which we will always connect. */\r\nprivate int remotePort;\r\n/** Storing the host just for reference. */\r\nprivate String remoteHost = \"HOST NOT YET SET\";\r\n// ....\r\n/**\r\n * @param host The host to which we are trying to connect\r\n * @param ignoredPort This port is ignored.  \r\n * @return A new Socket if we managed to create one to the host.\r\n * @throws java.io.IOException\r\n */\r\n@Override\r\npublic Socket createSocket(final String host, final int ignoredPort) throws IOException {\r\n    try {\r\n        final Socket socket = new Socket(host, remotePort);\r\n        this.remoteHost = host;\r\n        return socket;\r\n    } catch (IOException ioe) {\r\n        throw new IOException(\"Failed to open a socket back to host \" + host + \" on port \" + remotePort, ioe);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n// ....\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the only thing remaining to force your two way connection to stay on the same set of ports is some logic to recognize that you are calling back to the client-side.  In that situation, just make sure that your factory method for the remote object calls the RemoteObjectWrapper constructor up top with the callback parameter set to true.</p>\r\n',5812,'Bob Cross',NULL,NULL,NULL,'11/19/2008 19:39',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(354535,2,NULL,63748,'12/9/2008 22:48',1,NULL,'<p>Object.clone() has some major problems, and its use is discouraged in most cases.

Two issue: first, platform compatibility. Java still wins since JDK is well maintained by single and original company Sun.

But they can also be objects of themselves. This allows functions to be passed around as arguments, returned from functions or stored in data structures. This means that functions are first class objects in a programming language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anonymous functions don\'t add much to the language, they just allow you to write functions in a shorter way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b) <strong>A closure is a function plus a binding environment</strong>. closures can be passed <em>downwards</em> (as parameters) or returned <em>upwards</em> (as return values). This allows the function to refer to variables of its environment, even if the surrounding code is no longer active.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have a) in some language, then the question comes up what to do about b)? There are languages that have a), but not b). In the functional programming world a (functions) and b (functions as closures) is nowadays the norm. Smalltalk had a) (<em>blocks</em> are anonymous functions) for a long time, but then some dialects of Smalltalk added support for b) (blocks as closures).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can imagine that you get a slightly different programming model if you add functions and closures to the language. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a pragmatic view the anonymous function adds some short notation where you pass or invoke functions. That can be a good thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The closure (function plus binding) allows you for example to create a function that has access to some variables (for example to a counter value). Now you can store that function in an object, access it and invoke it. The context for the function object is now not only the objects it has access to, but also the variables it has access to via bindings. This is also useful, but you can see that variable bindings vs. access to object variables now is an issue: when should be something a <em>lexical</em> variable (that can be accessed in a closure) and when should it be a variable of some object (a <code>slot</code>). When should something be a closure or an object? You can use both in the similar ways.

I feel like I have a pretty firm grasp on what closures are, but I can\'t think of a solid example of how they would make an Object-Oriented language \"better.\"</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, most people who use the term \"closure\" actually mean \"function object\", and in this sense, function objects make it possible to write simpler code in certain circumstances such as when you need custom comparators in a sort function.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, in Python:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>def reversecmp(x, y):\r\n   return y - x\r\n\r\na = [4, 2, 5, 9, 11]\r\na.sort(cmp=reversecmp)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>This sorts the list a in reverse order by passing the custom comparison functoin reversecmp.  The addition of the lambda operator makes things even more compact:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>a = [4, 2, 5, 9, 11]\r\na.sort(cmp=lambda x, y : y - x)\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Java does not have function objects, so it uses \"functor classes\" to simulate them.  In Java you do the equivalent operation by implementing a custom version of the Comparator class, and passing that to the sort function:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>class ReverseComparator implements Comparator {\r\n   public compare(Object x, Object y) {\r\n      return (Integer) y - (Integer) x;\r\n   }\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nList&lt;Integer&gt; a = Arrays.asList(4, 2, 5, 9, 11);\r\nCollections.sort(a, new ReverseComparator());\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see, it gives the same effect as closures, but is clumsier and more verbose.  However, the addition of anonymous inner classes obviates most of the pain:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; a = Arrays.asList(4, 2, 5, 9, 11);\r\nComparator reverse = new Comparator() {\r\n   public Compare(Object x, Object y) {\r\n       return (Integer) y - (Integer) x;\r\n   }\r\n}\r\nCollections.sort(a, reverse);\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>So I would say that the combination of functor classes + anonymous inner classes in Java is sufficient to compensate for the lack of true function objects, making their addition unnecessary.</p>\r\n',42076,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'4/4/2009 7:28',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(715420,2,NULL,48203,'4/3/2009 19:45',1,NULL,'<p>Latest Ubuntu version.

Essentially\r\n  Delegates are objects that encode a method dispatch on a specified\r\n  object. This document shows how java inner classes provide a more\r\n  generic solution to such problems.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>What is a Delegate? Really it is very similar to a pointer to member\r\n  function as used in C++. But a delegate contains the target object\r\n  alongwith the method to be invoked. Ideally it would be nice to be\r\n  able to say:</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>obj.registerHandler(ano.methodOne); </p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>..and that the method methodOne would be called on ano when some specific event was received.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>This is what the Delegate structure achieves.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p><strong>Java Inner Classes</strong> </p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>It has been argued that Java provides this\r\n  functionality via inner classes and thus does not need the additional\r\n  Delegate construct.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>obj.registerHandler(new Handler() {\r\n        public void handleIt(Event ev) {\r\n            methodOne(ev);\r\n        }\r\n      } );\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p>At first glance this seems correct but at the same time a nuisance.\r\n  Because for many event processing examples the simplicity of the\r\n  Delegates syntax is very attractive.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p><strong>General Handler</strong> </p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>However, if event-based programming is used in a more\r\n  pervasive manner, say, for example, as a part of a general\r\n  asynchronous programming environment, there is more at stake.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>In such a general situation, it is not sufficient to include only the\r\n  target method and target object instance. In general there may be\r\n  other parameters required, that are determined within the context when\r\n  the event handler is registered.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>In this more general situation, the java approach can provide a very\r\n  elegant solution, particularly when combined with use of final\r\n  variables:</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>void processState(final T1 p1, final T2 dispatch) { \r\n  final int a1 = someCalculation();\r\n\r\n  m_obj.registerHandler(new Handler() {\r\n    public void handleIt(Event ev) {\r\n     dispatch.methodOne(a1, ev, p1);\r\n    }\r\n  } );\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p><strong>final * final * final</strong> </p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>Got your attention?</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>Note that the final variables are accessible from within the anonymous\r\n  class method definitions.

So each time I closed all the connections App A would make a bunch of new connections as per it\'s WEB.xml config file and run happily. App B would do the same. The problem is that they are <em>independent pools</em> which try to grab up to the server defined limit. It is a kind of race condition I guess. So when App A has finished with the connections it sits waiting to to use them again until the timeout has passed while App B who needs the connection now is denied the resources even though App A has finished with the and should be back in the pool. Once the timeout has passed, the connection is freed up and B (or C etc) can get at it again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>e.g. if the limit is 10 (mySQL profile limit) and each app has been configured to use a max of 10 the there will be 20 attempts at connections.

First of all, if I have understood correctly, Java already has\r\nsome basic notion of closures (defined through anonymous classes) but the new feature\r\nthat is going to be introduced is the support for closures based on anonymous functions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This extension will definitely make the language more expressive but I am not sure\r\nif it really fits with the rest of the language.\r\nJava has been designed as an object-oriented language with no support for functional programming: Will the new semantics be easy to understand? Java 6 does not even have functions, will Java 7 have anonymous functions but no \"normal\" functions?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My impression is that as new programming styles or paradigms like functional\r\nprogramming become more popular, everyone wants to use them in their\r\nfavourite OOP language. This is understandable: one wants to continue to use\r\na language they\'re familiar with while adopting new features. But in this way\r\na language can become really complex and lose coherence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So my attitude at the moment is to stick to Java 6 for OOP (I hope Java 6 will still\r\nbe supported for a while) and, in case I really get interested in doing OOP + FP,\r\nto take a look at some other language like Scala (Scala was defined to be multi-\r\nparadigm from the beginning and can be well integrated with Java) rather than switching\r\nto Java 7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think Java owes its success to the fact that it combines a simple language with very\r\npowerful libraries and tools, and I do not think that new features like closures will\r\nmake it a better programming language.</p>\r\n',815409,NULL,815409,NULL,'8/15/2011 19:41','8/15/2011 19:41',NULL,NULL,NULL,4,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6462053,2,NULL,40480,'6/24/2011 0:13',1,NULL,'<p>In my opinion, \"pass by value\" is a terrible way to singularly describe two similar but different events.

Our stack is Stripes/EJB3/JPA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many use Stripes plus Stripernate as a single, full stack solution. We don\'t because we want our business logic within the EJB tier, so we simply rely on JPA Entities as combined Model and DTO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stripes does the binding to our Entities/DTO and we shove them back in to the EJB tier for work. For most of our CRUD stuff this is very thing and straightforward, making our 80% use case trivial to work with. Yet we have the flexibility to do whatever we want for the edge cases that always come up with complicate applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have a very large base Action Bean which encapsulates the bulk of our CRUD operations that makes call backs in to the individual subclasses specific to the entities and forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also have a large internal tag file library to manage our pages, security, navigation, tasks, etc. A simple CRUD edit form is little more than a list of field names, and we get all of the chrome and menus and access controls \"for free\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The beauty of this is that we get to keep the HTTP request based metaphor that we like and we get to choose the individual parts of the system rather than use one fat stack.

So, the entire stack is very nimble and amicable to change. Stripes is a big factor of that since we let it do the few things that it does, and does very well. Then delegate the rest to other parts of the stack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As always there are parts folks would rather have different at times, but Stripes would be the last part to go in our stack, frankly.

Other than that, it is all subjective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I share C# code across the following platforms:\r\n- iOS (iPhone/iPad)\r\n- Android\r\n- The Web (HTML5)\r\n- Mac (OS X)\r\n- Linux\r\n- Windows</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could share it even more places:\r\n- Windows Phone 7\r\n- Wii\r\n- XBox\r\n- PS3\r\n- etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggie is iOS since <a href=\"http://xamarin.com/monotouch\">MonoTouch</a> works fantastically. I do not know of any good way to target iOS with Java. You cannot target Windows Phone 7 with Java, so I would say that the days of Java being better for mobile are behind us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest factor for me though is personal productivity (and happiness). C# as a language is years ahead of Java IMHO and the .NET framework is a joy to use. Most of what is being added in Java 7 and Java 8 has been in C# for years. JVM languages like Scala and Clojure (both available on the CLR) are pretty nice though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I see Mono as a platform in it\'s own right (a great one) and treat .NET as the Microsoft implementation of Mono on Windows. This means that I develop and test on Mono first. This works wonderfully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If both Java and .NET (Mono let\'s say) were Open Source projects without any corporate backing, I would choose Mono over Java every time. I believe it is just a better platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both .NET/Mono and the JVM are great choices, although I would personally use some other language than Java on the JVM.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>My take on some of the other comments:</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Issue: Performance.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>**Answer: Both the JVM and the CLR perform better than detractors say they do. I would say that the JVM performs better. Mono is generally slower than .NET (though not always).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I personally would take ASP.NET MVC over J2EE any day both as a developer and an end-user. Support for <a href=\"http://www.mono-project.com/Release_Notes_Mono_2.10#Google_Native_Client_Support\">Google Native Client</a> is pretty cool too. Also, I know that poor GUI performance for desktop Java apps is supposed to be a thing of the past but I keep finding slow ones. Then again, I could say the same for WPF. GTK# is plenty fast though so there is no reason they have to be slow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Issue: Java has a larger ecosystem of libraries available.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer: Probably true, but it is a non-issue in practice.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Practically every Java library (including the JDK) runs just dandy on .NET/Mono thanks to <a href=\"http://www.ikvm.net/\">IKVM.NET</a>. This piece of technology is a true marvel. The integration is amazing; you can use a Java library just like it was native. I have only had to use Java libraries in one .NET app though. The .NET/Mono ecosystem generally offers more than I need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Issue: Java has better (broader) tools support</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer: Not on Windows. Otherwise I agree. MonoDevelop is nice though.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to give a shout-out to <a href=\"http://monodevelop.com/\">MonoDevelop</a>; it is a jewel. MonoDevelop integrates most of the tools I want use including code completion (intellisense), Git/Subversion integration, support for unit tests, SQL integration, debugging, easy refactoring, and assembly browsing with on-the-fly decompilation. It is wonderful to use the same environment for everything from server-side web to mobile apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Issue: Compatibility across platforms.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer: Mono is a single code-base across all platforms, including Windows.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Develop for Mono first and deploy to .NET on Windows if you like. If you compare .NET from MS to Java though then Java has the edge in terms of consistency across platforms. See next answer...</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Issue: Mono lags .NET.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer: No it does not.</strong> IMHO, this is an often stated but incorrect statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mono distribution from Xamarin ships with C#, VB.NET, F#, IronPython, IronRuby, and I think maybe Boo out of the box. The Mono C# compiler is completely up to date with MS. The Mono VB.NET compiler does lag the MS version. The other compilers are the same on both platforms (as are other .NET languages like Nemerle, Boo, and Phalanger (PHP) ).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mono ships with a lot of the actual Microsoft written code including the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR), Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF), F#, and ASP.NET MVC. Because Razor is not Open Source, Mono currently ships with MVC2 but MVC3 works on Mono just fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The core Mono platform has kept pace with .NET or many years and the compatibility is impressive. You can use the full C# 4.0 language and even some C# 5.0 features today. In fact, Mono often leads .NET in many ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mono implements parts of the CLR spec that even Microsoft does not support (like 64 bit arrays). One of the most exciting new pieces of technology in the .NET world is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Roslyn\">Rosylyn</a>. Mono has offered the C# compiler as a service for many years. Some of what Rosylyn offers is available via <a href=\"http://wiki.sharpdevelop.net/NRefactory.ashx\">NRefractory</a> as well. An example of were Mono is still ahead would be the SIMD instructions to accelerate gaming performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Microsoft does offer a number of products on top of .NET that are not available in Mono which is were the misconception about Mono lagging comes from. Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Entity Framework (EF), WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) are examples of products which do not work, or are poorly supported, on Mono. The obvious solution is to use cross-platform alternatives like GTK#, NHibernate, and ServiceStack instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Issue: Microsoft is evil.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer: True. So what.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people offer the following reasons to avoid using Mono:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1) You should not use Mono because Microsoft tech should be avoided</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) Mono sucks because it does not let you use every technology that Microsoft offers</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To me, it is clear that these statements are incompatible. I reject the first statement but will skip that argument here. The second statement is true of all .NET alternatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The JVM is a great platform and the explosion of JVM languages is awesome. Use what makes you happy. For now, that is often .NET/Mono for me.</p>\r\n',332026,NULL,332026,NULL,'1/28/2012 22:07','1/28/2012 22:07',NULL,NULL,NULL,8,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9170760,2,NULL,64036,'2/7/2012 3:51',1,NULL,'<p>One very easy and simple approach is to use Jackson JSON to serialize complex Java Object to JSON and read it back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonInFiveMinutes\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonInFiveMinutes</a></p>\r\n',660029,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2/7/2012 3:51',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9176224,2,NULL,44396,'2/7/2012 12:24',2,NULL,'<p>I\'m running STS 2.8.1 which is basically eclipse + spring tools; In an existing maven project, I right clicked on the project -> maven -> Download Sources and Download JavaDocs</p>\r\n',1194632,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2/7/2012 12:24',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9192126,2,NULL,42102,'2/8/2012 11:07',10,NULL,'<p>This question might be old but since this was the nearest answer I found when I had this problem I though I\'d describe my solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using Junit4</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Split your tests up so that there is one test method per class (this solution only changes classloaders between classes, not between methods as the parent runner gathers all the methods once per class)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Add the @RunWith(SeparateClassloaderTestRunner.class) annotation to your test classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Create the SeparateClassloaderTestRunner to look like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>public class SeparateClassloaderTestRunner extends BlockJUnit4ClassRunner {\r\n\r\n    public SeparateClassloaderTestRunner(Class&lt;?&gt; clazz) throws InitializationError {\r\n        super(getFromTestClassloader(clazz));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static Class&lt;?&gt; getFromTestClassloader(Class&lt;?&gt; clazz) throws InitializationError {\r\n        try {\r\n            ClassLoader testClassLoader = new TestClassLoader();\r\n            return Class.forName(clazz.getName(), true, testClassLoader);\r\n        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {\r\n            throw new InitializationError(e);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static class TestClassLoader extends URLClassLoader {\r\n        public TestClassLoader() {\r\n            super(((URLClassLoader)getSystemClassLoader()).getURLs());\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public Class&lt;?&gt; loadClass(String name) throws ClassNotFoundException {\r\n            if (name.startsWith(\"org.mypackages.\")) {\r\n                return super.findClass(name);\r\n            }\r\n            return super.loadClass(name);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Note I had to do this to test code running in a legacy framework which I couldn\'t change.

But the author specifically mentioned <em>in pure Java</em>, so that\'s out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another option would be to feed the JRE bogus byte codes; it\'s easy enough to dump some garbage binary data to a .class file, and ask the JRE to run it:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>$ echo \'crap crap crap\' &gt; crap.class\r\n$ java crap\r\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.ClassFormatError: Incompatible magic value 1668440432 in class file crap\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Does that count? I mean the JRE itself hasn\'t crashed; it properly detected the bogus code, reported it, and exited. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This leaves us with the most obvious kinds of solutions such as blowing the stack via recursion, running out of heap memory via object allocations, or simply throwing <code>RuntimeException</code>. But this just causes the JRE to exit with a <code>StackOverflowError</code> or similar exception, which, again <em>is not really a crash</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what\'s left?

Generics is a mechanism of specifying types for objects belonging to collections, such as Arraylists, so that type safety is guaranteed at compile time. Autoboxing allows the automatic conversions between primitive types (e.g. int) and wrapper types (e.g. Integer). Improved syntax for looping includes the enhancements for each loop for going through the items of array or collections comparatively easily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Java 6 focuses on new specifications and APIs including XML, Web Services, JDBC version 4.0, programming based on Annotations, APIâ€™s for Java compiler and Application client GUI.With new compiler API added with Java 6, the java compiler can now receive and/or send output to an abstraction of the file system (programs can specify/process compiler output).

However, its pure-java version,\r\n  which totally translates c/c++ codes of SQLite into Java, is\r\n  significantly slower compared to its native version, which uses SQLite\r\n  binaries compiled for each OS (win, mac, linux).</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>To use the native version of sqlite-jdbc, user had to set a path to\r\n  the native codes (dll, jnilib, so files, which are JNDI C programs) by\r\n  using command-line arguments, e.g., -Djava.library.path=(path to the\r\n  dll, jnilib, etc.), or -Dorg.sqlite.lib.path, etc. This process was\r\n  error-prone and bothersome to tell every user to set these variables.\r\n  Our SQLiteJDBC library completely does away these inconveniences.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>Another difference is that we are keeping this SQLiteJDBC libray\r\n  up-to-date to the newest version of SQLite engine, because we are one\r\n  of the hottest users of this library.

In general, the JVM aims to optimize more dynamic, higher-level code while the CLR gives you more low-level tools to do these kinds of optimizations yourself. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good example is stack allocation. On the CLR you have explicit stack allocation of custom value types. On the JVM the only custom types are reference types but the JVM can convert heap allocations to stack allocations in certain circumstances through Escape Analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another example. In Java, methods are virtual by default. On C# at least, they are not. It is much more difficult to optimize virtual method calls because the code that gets executed at a given call site cannot be determined statically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the hood, their execution systems are quite different. Most JVMs (in particular, Hotspot) start out with a bytecode interpreter and only JIT-compile parts of the code that are executed heavily e.g. tight loops. They can also re-compile these over and over each time using execution statistics collected from previous runs to drive optimizations. This allows more optimization effort to be applied to the parts of the program that need it most. This is called adaptive optimization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CLR compiles everything up-front only once. It does fewer optimization both because it has more code to compile and so has to be fast and because it doesn\'t have any statistics of the actual execution paths taken to feed into its optimizations. This approach does have the very significant advantage of allowing you to cache compilation results across processes, which CLR does but JVM does not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A large percentage of the Hotspot JVM code is dedicated to these adaptive optimizations and they are what put Java in the same performance ballpark as native code for most general purpose computation in the early 2000s. They are also what makes the JVM a decent target for dynamic languages. I\'m excluding here the more recent developments of the Dynamic Languages Runtime and invokedynamic as I don\'t know enough about the DLR.</p>\r\n',199288,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'4/7/2013 11:47',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(16018266,2,NULL,40471,'4/15/2013 14:49',2,NULL,'<p><a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">HashTable</a> is a legacy class in the jdk that shouldn\'t be used anymore.

You need to know how (or if) the caller\'s variable can be affected by the called method. The difference between object reference and primitive variables, when passed into methods, is huge and important. To understand this section, you\'ll need to be comfortable with the assignments section covered in the first part of this chapter.\r\nPassing Object Reference Variables\r\nWhen you pass an object variable into a method, you must keep in mind that you\'re passing the object reference, and not the actual object itself. Remember that a reference variable holds bits that represent (to the underlying VM) a way to get to a specific object in memory (on the heap). More importantly, you must remember that you aren\'t even passing the actual reference variable, but rather a copy of the reference variable. A copy of a variable means you get a copy of the bits in that variable, so when you pass a reference variable, you\'re passing a copy of the bits representing how to get to a specific object. In other words, both the caller and the called method will now have identical copies of the reference, and thus both will refer to the same exact (not a copy) object on the heap.\r\nFor this example, we\'ll use the Dimension class from the java.awt package:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>         1. import java.awt.Dimension;\r\n         2. class ReferenceTest {\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>3.   public static void main (String [] args) {\r\n4.     Dimension d = new Dimension(5,10);\r\n5.     ReferenceTest rt = new ReferenceTest();\r\n6.     System.out.println(\"Before modify() d.height = \"\r\n+ d.height);\r\n7.     rt.modify(d);\r\n8.     System.out.println(\"After modify() d.height = \"\r\n9. }\r\n                10.\r\n                11.\r\n                12.\r\n                13.   }\r\n                14. }</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we run this class, we can see that the modify() method was indeed able to modify the original (and only) Dimension object created on line 4.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<pre><code>            C:\\Java Projects\\Reference&gt;java ReferenceTest\r\n            Before modify() d.height = 10\r\n            dim = 11\r\n            After modify() d.height = 11\r\n</code></pre>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Notice when the Dimension object on line 4 is passed to the modify() method, any changes to the object that occur inside the method are being made to the object whose reference was passed. In the preceding example, reference variables d and dim both point to the same object.\r\nDoes Java Use Pass-By-Value Semantics?\r\nIf Java passes objects by passing the reference variable instead, does that mean Java uses pass-by-reference for objects? Not exactly, although you\'ll often hear and read that it does. Java is actually pass-by-value for all variables running within a single VM. Pass-by-value means pass-by-variable-value. And that means, pass-by-copy-of- the-variable! (There\'s that word copy again!)\r\nIt makes no difference if you\'re passing primitive or reference variables, you are always passing a copy of the bits in the variable. So for a primitive variable, you\'re passing a copy of the bits representing the value. For example, if you pass an int variable with the value of 3, you\'re passing a copy of the bits representing 3. The called method then gets its own copy of the value, to do with it what it likes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if you\'re passing an object reference variable, you\'re passing a copy of the bits representing the reference to an object. The called method then gets its own copy of the reference variable, to do with it what it likes. But because two identical reference variables refer to the exact same object, if the called method modifies the object (by invoking setter methods, for example), the caller will see that the object the caller\'s original variable refers to has also been changed. In the next section, we\'ll look at how the picture changes when we\'re talking about primitives.\r\nThe bottom line on pass-by-value: the called method can\'t change the caller\'s variable, although for object reference variables, the called method can change the object the variable referred to. What\'s the difference between changing the variable and changing the object? For object references, it means the called method can\'t reassign the caller\'s original reference variable and make it refer to a different object, or null. For example, in the following code fragment,</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>        void bar() {\r\n           Foo f = new Foo();\r\n           doStuff(f);\r\n        }\r\n        void doStuff(Foo g) {\r\n           g.setName(\"Boo\");\r\n           g = new Foo();\r\n        }\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>reassigning g does not reassign f! At the end of the bar() method, two Foo objects have been created, one referenced by the local variable f and one referenced by\r\nthe local (argument) variable g. Because the doStuff() method has a copy of the reference variable, it has a way to get to the original Foo object, for instance to call the setName() method. But, the doStuff() method does not have a way to get to the f reference variable. So doStuff() can change values within the object f refers to, but doStuff() can\'t change the actual contents (bit pattern) of f. In other words, doStuff() can change the state of the object that f refers to, but it can\'t make f refer to a different object!\r\nPassing Primitive Variables\r\nLet\'s look at what happens when a primitive variable is passed to a method:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>               class ReferenceTest {\r\n                  public static void main (String [] args) {\r\n      int a = 1;\r\n      ReferenceTest rt = new ReferenceTest();\r\n      System.out.println(\"Before modify() a = \" + a);\r\n      rt.modify(a);\r\n      System.out.println(\"After modify() a = \" + a);\r\n    }\r\n    void modify(int number) {\r\n      number = number + 1;\r\n      System.out.println(\"number = \" + number);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>In this simple program, the variable a is passed to a method called modify(),\r\nwhich increments the variable by 1. The resulting output looks like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>  Before modify() a = 1\r\n  number = 2\r\n  After modify() a = 1\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Notice that a did not change after it was passed to the method. Remember, it was a copy of a that was passed to the method. When a primitive variable is passed to a method, it is passed by value, which means pass-by-copy-of-the-bits-in-the-variable.</p>\r\n',1255825,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'6/25/2013 17:12',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'6/25/2013 17:12'),(17310303,2,NULL,62289,'6/26/2013 1:48',0,NULL,'<p>My previous edit to @David\'s answer was rejected.
