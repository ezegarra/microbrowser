I\'ll use just Java terminology, because I am more <em>au fait</em> with that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the answers mentioned, <code>int</code> is just a number (called the <em>unboxed</em> type), whereas <code>Integer</code> is an object (which contains the number, hence a <em>boxed</em> type). In Java terms, that means (apart from not being able to call methods on <code>int</code>), you cannot store <code>int</code> or other non-object types in collections (<code>List</code>, <code>Map</code>, etc.). In order to store them, you must first box them up in its corresponding boxed type.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Java 5 onwards have something called <em>auto-boxing</em> and <em>auto-unboxing</em> which allow the boxing/unboxing to be done behind the scenes.

Ok, ok. Seriously, last one. If you don\'t know the baud rate of the device you are trying to communicate with, you have two choices. Start guessing, or possibly bust out an o-scope.

A variable whose type is a primitive type always holds a primitive value of that type.</p>\n\n<pre><code>int aNumber = 4;\nint anotherNum = aNumber;\naNumber += 6;\nSystem.out.println(anotherNum); // Prints 4\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>An object is a dynamically created class instance or an array. The reference values (often just references) are pointers to these objects and a special null reference, which refers to no object. There may be many references to the same object.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Integer aNumber = Integer.valueOf(4);\nInteger anotherNumber = aNumber; // anotherNumber references the \n                                 // same object as aNumber\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also in Java everything is passed by value. With objects the value that is passed is the reference to the object. So another difference between int and Integer in java is how they are passed in method calls. For example in</p>\n\n<pre><code>public int add(int a, int b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\nfinal int two = 2;\nint sum = add(1, two);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The variable <em>two</em> is passed as the primitive integer type 2. Whereas in</p>\n\n<pre><code>public int add(Integer a, Integer b) {\n    return a.intValue() + b.intValue();\n}\nfinal Integer two = Integer.valueOf(2);\nint sum = add(Integer.valueOf(1), two);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The variable <em>two</em> is passed as a reference to an object that holds the integer value 2.</p>\n\n<p><hr /></p>\n\n<p>@WolfmanDragon:\nPass by reference would work like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void increment(int x) {\n  x = x + 1;\n}\nint a = 1;\nincrement(a);\n// a is now 2\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When increment is called it passes a reference (pointer) to variable <em>a</em>.

This is further indicated when I try to print the default time zone\'s <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/TimeZone.html#getDisplayName()\" rel=\"nofollow\">display name</a>, and it comes up \"GMT-08:00\", which seems to indicate to me that it is not correctly set to the US Pacific time zone.  I am running on Ubuntu Hardy Heron, upgraded from Gutsy Gibbon.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a configuration file I can update to tell the JRE to use Pacific with all the associated daylight savings time information?  The time on my machine shows correctly, so it doesn\'t seem to be an OS-wide misconfiguration.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Ok, here\'s an update. A coworker suggested I update JAVA_OPTS in my /etc/profile to include \"-Duser.timezone=US/Pacific\", which worked (I also saw CATALINA_OPTS, which I updated as well). Actually, I just exported the change into the variables rather than use the new /etc/profile (a reboot later will pick up the changes and I will be golden).</p>\n\n<p>However, I still think there is a better solution... there should be a configuration for Java somewhere that says what timezone it is using, or how it is grabbing the timezone. If someone knows such a setting, that would be awesome, but for now this is a decent workaround.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I am using 1.5, and it is most definitely a DST problem.  As you can see, the time zone is set to not use daylight savings.  My belief is it is generically set to -8 offset rather than the specific Pacific timezone.  Since the generic -8 offset has no daylight savings info, it\'s of course not using it, but the question is, where do I tell Java to use Pacific time zone when it starts up?  I\'m NOT looking for a programmatic solution, it should be a configuration solution.</p>\n','java,timezone',NULL,'@'),(6397,'A',6392,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-08-08 21:31:00',NULL,'E','','<p>Hmm... off by one hour.

First, it creates a dependency on a particular operating system, which prevents the application from easily moving to another operating system. One of Java’s main benefits is the ability to run the same bytecode on many different platforms. Using an absolute path like this makes the code much less portable.</p>\n\n<p>Second, depending on the relative location of the file, this technique might create an external dependency and limit the application’s mobility. If the file exists outside the application’s current directory, this creates an external dependency and one would have to be aware of the dependency in order to move the application to another machine (error prone).</p>\n\n<p>Instead, use the <code>getResource()</code> methods in the <code>Class</code> class.

It makes sense. Can you please explain me MathContext in the context of BigDecimal#round method.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There\'s nothing special about <code>BigDecimal.round()</code> <em>vs.</em> any other <code>BigDecimal</code> method.  In all cases, the <code>MathContext</code> specifies the number of significant digits and the rounding technique.  Basically, there are two parts of every <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/math/MathContext.html\"><code>MathContext</code></a>.  There\'s a precision, and there\'s also a <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/math/RoundingMode.html\"><code>RoundingMode</code></a>.</p>\n\n<p>The precision again specifies the number of significant digits.  So if you specify <code>123</code> as a number, and ask for 2 significant digits, you\'re going to get <code>120</code>.  It might be clearer if you think in terms of scientific notation.</p>\n\n<p><code>123</code> would be <code>1.23e2</code> in scientific notation.  If you only keep 2 significant digits, then you get <code>1.2e2</code>, or <code>120</code>.  By reducing the number of significant digits, we reduce the precision with which we can specify a number.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>RoundingMode</code> part specifies how we should handle the loss of precision.  To reuse the example, if you use <code>123</code> as the number, and ask for 2 significant digits, you\'ve reduced your precision.  With a <code>RoundingMode</code> of <code>HALF_UP</code> (the default mode), <code>123</code> will become <code>120</code>.  With a <code>RoundingMode</code> of <code>CEILING</code>, you\'ll get <code>130</code>.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>System.out.println(new BigDecimal(\"123.4\",\n                   new MathContext(4,RoundingMode.HALF_UP)));\nSystem.out.println(new BigDecimal(\"123.4\",\n                   new MathContext(2,RoundingMode.HALF_UP)));\nSystem.out.println(new BigDecimal(\"123.4\",\n                   new MathContext(2,RoundingMode.CEILING)));\nSystem.out.println(new BigDecimal(\"123.4\",\n                   new MathContext(1,RoundingMode.CEILING)));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Outputs:</p>\n\n<pre><code>123.4\n1.2E+2\n1.3E+2\n2E+2\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can see that both the precision and the rounding mode affect the output.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(7596,'Q',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,11,0,13283,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,5141,-6.23319e+09,0,'html','2008-08-11 07:45:00','2012-01-31 16:16:00','E','How should I structure a Java application, in other words: where do I put my classes?','<p>First of all, I know how to build a Java application.

If your server doesn\'t offer up anything enticing on the default ports or in the default locations, the automated attacker will move on. Therefore, if you\'re going to run a ssh server, put it on a non-standard port (>1024) and it\'s likely it will never be found.

There\'s now an additional code dependency that did not previously exist.  Updating the set of schedules is now more difficult, as either a custom tool must be coded or a DB-specific interface must be used, whereas previous notepad.exe was sufficient.  Scalability is not a concern here, either.  The needs of this system could increase by a million and the flat file would still work just fine.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, it\'s possible that in the future needs will evolve to the point that it\'s worth moving to a database.  That\'s when you make the change.  Trying to future-proof an application never works, because we <em>always</em> assume incorrectly about future needs.  We can\'t say it\'ll only take a few hours to embed the database either, because we suck at estimating schedules, too.

Depends on <code>services.xml</code> beans.</li>\n<li><em><strong>views.xml</strong></em> - My view implementations.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This list is neither perfect nor exhaustive, but I hope it illustrates the point.

Can make detecting circular/unwanted dependencies a little easier.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Helps domain design</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you want to add a bean definition, but it doesn\'t fit well in any of your context files, perhaps there\'s a new concept or concern emerging? Examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Suppose you want to make your Service layer transactional with AOP. Do you add those bean definitions to <code>services.xml</code>, or put them in their own <code>transactionPolicy.xml</code>? Talk it over with your team. Should your transaction policy be pluggable?</li>\n<li>Add Acegi/Spring Security beans to your <code>controllers.xml</code> file, or create a <code>security.xml</code> context file? Do you have different security requirements for different deployments/environments?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Integration testing</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can wire up a subset of your application for integration testing (ex: given the above files, to test the database you need to create only <code>datasource.xml</code> and <code>persistence.xml</code> beans).</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, you can annotate an integration test class as such:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@ContextConfiguration(locations = { \"/spring/datasource.xml\" , \"/spring/persistence.xml\" })\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Works well with Spring IDE\'s Beans Graph</strong></p>\n\n<p>Having lots of focused and well-named context files makes it easy to create custom BeansConfigSets to visualize the layers of your app using Spring IDE\'s <a href=\"http://springide.org/project/wiki/BeansGraph\">Beans Graph</a>.

Three years later, developers were fleeing the company and we were still X months away from actually selling anything.</p>\n\n<p>The big mistake was in being too ambitious. If this is your first job, you <em>will</em> make mistakes and you <em>will</em> need to change how things work long after you\'ve written them.

If it turns out that the entire system needs to be rewritten, because you made some mistake in your first version, then it\'s better to admit this as soon as possible so you can get to it. Correspondingly, don\'t try to make an architecture that can anticipate every possible contingency in your first version, because you don\'t know what every contingency is and will just get it wrong.

Add a Subject Line</strong> </p>\n\n<p>You can prefill the subject line in the email by adding the subject preceded by \'<strong>?subject=</strong>\' after the email address. </p>\n\n<p>So the link now becomes: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"mailto:someone@yoursite.com?subject=Mail from Our Site\"&gt;Email Us&lt;/a&gt; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>2. Send to Multiple Recipients</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Mail can be sent to additional recipients either as carbon copies (cc) or blind carbon copies (bcc). </p>\n\n<p>This is done in a similar way, by placing \'<strong>?cc=someoneelse@theirsite.com</strong>\' after the initial address. </p>\n\n<p>So the link looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"mailto:someone@yoursite.com?cc=someoneelse@theirsite.com\"&gt;Email Us&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>cc can simply be replaced by bcc if you wish to send blind carbon copies. </p>\n\n<p>This can be very useful if you have links on pages with different subjects. You might have the email on each page go to the appropriate person in a company but with a copy of all mails sent to a central address also. </p>\n\n<p>You can of course specify more than one additional recipient, just separate your list of recipients with a comma. </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"mailto:someone@yoursite.com?cc=someoneelse@theirsite.com, another@thatsite.com, me@mysite.com\"&gt;Email Us&lt;/a&gt; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Sourced from <a href=\"http://www.outfront.net/tutorials_02/adv_tech/mailto.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Getting More From \'mailto\'</a> which now 404s.

Combining Code</strong> </p>\n\n<p>You can combine the various bits of code above by the addition of an \'&amp;\' between each.</p>\n\n<p>Thus adding </p>\n\n<pre><code>me@mysite.com?subject=Hello&amp;cc=you@yoursite.com&amp;bcc=her@hersite.com\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>would send an email with the subject \'Hello\' to me, you and her. </p>\n\n<p><strong>4.

To add some thing to the body of the email it is again as simple as above - \'<strong>?body=</strong>\' after the email address. However formatting that email can be a little tricky. To create spaces between words you will have to use hex code - for example \'<strong>%20</strong>\' between each word, and to create new lines will mean adding \'<strong>%0D</strong>\'. Similarly symbols such as <strong>$</strong> signs will need to be written in hex code.</p>\n\n<p>If you also wish to add a subject line and send copies to multiple recipients, this can make for a very long and difficult to write bit of code. </p>\n\n<p>It will send a message to three people, with the subject and the message filled in, all you need to do is add your name. </p>\n\n<p>Just look at the code! </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"mailto:abbeyvet@outfront.net?CC=spooky@outfront.net\n&amp;BCC=thomasbrunt@outfront.net&amp;Subject=Please%2C%20I%20insist\n%21&amp;Body=Hi%0DI%20would%20like%20to%20send%20you%20\n%241000000%20to%20divide%20as%20you%20see%20fit%20among\n%20yourselves%20and%20all%20the%20moderators.%0DPlease%\n20let%20me%20know%20to%20whom%20I%20should%20send\n%20the%20check.\"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>Note: Original source URL where I found this is now 404ing so I <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20121123210358/http://www.outfront.net/tutorials_02/adv_tech/mailto.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">grabbed to content from waybackmachine</a> and posted it here so it doesn\'t get lost.

For those that don\'t know (probably everyone), Project Darkstar is a framework for massively multiplayer online games that attempts to take care of all of the \"hard stuff.\"  The basic idea is that you write your game server logic in such a way that all operations are broken up into tiny tasks.  You pass these tasks to the Project Darkstar framework which handles distributing them to a specific node in the cluster, any concurrency issues, and finally persisting the data.</p>\n\n<p>Apparently doing this kind of thing is a much different problem for video games than it is for enterprise applications.  Jim Waldo, who gave the lecture, claims that MMO games have a DB read/write ratio of 50/50, whereas enterprise apps are more like 90% read, 10% write.  He also claims that most existing MMOs keep everything in memory exlcusively, and only dump to a DB every 6 hours of so.  This means if a server goes down, you would lose all of the work since the last DB dump.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the project itself sounds really cool, but I don\'t think the industry will accept it.  First, you have to write your server code in Java.  The client code can be written in anything (Jim claims ActionScript 3 is the most popular, follow by C++), but the server stuff has to be Java.  Sounds good to me, but I really get the impression that everyone in the games industry hates Java.</p>\n\n<p>Second, unlike other industries where developers prefer to use existing frameworks and libraries, the guys in the games industry seem to like to write everything themselves.  Not only that, they like to rewrite everything for every new game they produce.  Things are starting to change where developers are using Havok for physics, Unreal Engine 3 as their platform, etc., but for the most part it looks like everything is still proprietary.</p>\n\n<p>So, are the guys at Project Darkstar just wasting their time?  Can a general framework like this really work for complex games with the performance that is required?  Even if it does work, are game companies willing to use it?</p>\n','java,concurrency,distributed',NULL,'@'),(20127,'Q',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,7,0,20870,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,2380,-6.39246e+09,0,'html','2008-08-21 14:41:00','2008-08-21 14:42:00','E','Virtual Machine Optimization','<p>I am messing around with <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/zemscript/\">a toy interpreter in Java</a> and I was considering trying to write a simple compiler that can generate bytecode for the Java Virtual Machine.

However, one big difference between the Java and Python approaches is that with reference counting in the common case (no circular references) objects are cleaned up immediately rather than at some indeterminate later date.</p>\n\n<p>For example, I can write sloppy, non-portable code in CPython such as</p>\n\n<pre><code>def parse_some_attrs(fname):\n    return open(fname).read().split(\"~~~\")[2:4]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and the file descriptor for that file I opened will be cleaned up immediately because as soon as the reference to the open file goes away, the file is garbage collected and the file descriptor is freed.  Of course, if I run Jython or IronPython or possibly PyPy, then the garbage collector won\'t necessarily run until much later; possibly I\'ll run out of file descriptors first and my program will crash.</p>\n\n<p>So you SHOULD be writing code that looks like</p>\n\n<pre><code>def parse_some_attrs(fname):\n    with open(fname) as f:\n        return f.read().split(\"~~~\")[2:4]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but sometimes people like to rely on reference counting to always free up their resources because it can sometimes make your code a little shorter.</p>\n\n<p>I\'d say that the best garbage collector is the one with the best performance, which currently seems to be the Java-style generational garbage collectors that can run in a separate thread and has all these crazy optimizations, etc.  The differences to how you write your code should be negligible and ideally non-existent.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(22409,'Q',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,4,0,848533,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558593,7563,9.87663e+09,0,'html','2008-08-22 13:51:00','2012-01-11 19:02:00','E','How do I convert images between CMYK and RGB in ColdFusion (Java)?','<p>I have a need to convert images from CMYK to RGB - not necessarily back again, but hey, if it can be done...</p>\n\n<p>With the release of ColdFusion 8, we got the <a href=\"http://cfquickdocs.com/cf8/?getDoc=cfimage\" rel=\"nofollow\">CFImage</a> tag, but it doesn\'t support this conversion; and nor does <a href=\"http://x.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image.cfc</a>, or <a href=\"http://x.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alagad\'s Image Component</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, it should be possible in Java; which we can leverage through CF.

For example, if you\'ve got a list containing a lot of objects, DB4O activation of these lists is slow. There are a number of ways to get around this problem, for example, by inverting the relationship.</p>\n\n<p>Another pain is activation. When you retrieve or delete an object from DB4O, by default it will activate the whole object tree. For example, loading a Foo will load Foo.Bar.Baz.Bat, etc until there\'s nothing left to load. While this is nice from a programming standpoint, performance will slow down the more nesting in your objects. To improve performance, you can tell DB4O how many levels deep to activate. This is time-consuming to do if you\'ve got a lot of objects.</p>\n\n<p>Another area of pain was text searching. DB4O\'s text searching is far, far slower than SQL full text indexing. (They\'ll tell you this outright on their site.) The good news is, it\'s easy to setup a text searching engine on top of DB4O. On our project, we\'ve hooked up Lucene.NET to index the text fields we want.</p>\n\n<p>Some APIs don\'t seem to work, such as the GetField APIs useful in applying database upgrades. (For example, you\'ve renamed a property and you want to upgrade your existing objects in the database, you need to use these \"reflection\" APIs to find objects in the database. Other APIs, such as the [Index] attribute don\'t work in the stable 6.4 version, and you must instead specify indexes using the Configure().Index(\"someField\"), which is not strongly typed.</p>\n\n<p>We\'ve witnessed performance degrade the larger your database. We have a 1GB database right now and things are still fast, but not nearly as fast as when we started with a tiny database.</p>\n\n<p>We\'ve found another issue where Db4O.GetByID will close the database if the ID doesn\'t exist anymore in the database.</p>\n\n<p>We\'ve found the Native Query syntax (the most natural, language-integrated syntax for queries) is far, far slower than the less-friendly SODA queries. So instead of typing:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// C# syntax for \"Find all MyFoos with Bar == 23\".\n// (Note the Java syntax is more verbose using the Predicate class.)\nIList&lt;MyFoo&gt; results = db4o.Query&lt;MyFoo&gt;(input =&gt; input.Bar == 23);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Instead of that nice query code, you have to an ugly SODA query which is string-based and not strongly-typed.</p>\n\n<p>For .NET folks, they\'ve recently introduced a LINQ-to-DB4O provider, which provides for the best syntax yet. However, it\'s yet to be seen whether performance will be up-to-par with the ugly SODA queries.</p>\n\n<p>DB4O support has been decent: we\'ve talked to them on the phone a number of times and have received helpful info. Their user forums are next to worthless, however, almost all questions go unanswered. Their JIRA bug tracker receives a lot of attention, so if you\'ve got a nagging bug, file it on JIRA on it often will get fixed. (We\'ve had 2 bugs that have been fixed, and another one that got patched in a half-assed way.)</p>\n\n<p>If all this hasn\'t scared you off, let me say that we\'re very happy with DB4O, despite the problems we\'ve encountered. The performance we\'ve got has blown away some O/RM frameworks we tried. I recommend it.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(24510,'A',24495,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-08-23 19:10:00',NULL,'E','','<p>You should change the #if line to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#if($car)\n</code></pre>\n','',NULL,'@'),(24551,'Q',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,8,0,24558,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,19033,-7.02834e+08,0,'html','2008-08-23 19:59:00','2008-08-24 15:09:00','E','Best Practice: Initialize class fields in constructor or at declaration?','<p>I\'ve been programming in C# and Java recently and I am curious what people would consider the best practice concerning when you should initialize your classes fields?</p>\n\n<p>Should you do it at declaration?:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Die\n{\n\n    private int topFace = 1;\n    private Random myRand = new Random();\n\n    public void Roll()\n    {\n       // ....\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or in a constructor..</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Die\n{\n\n    private int topFace;\n    private Random myRand;\n\n    public Die()\n    {\n        topFace = 1;\n        myRand = new Random();\n    }\n\n    public void Roll()\n    {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I\'m really curious what some of you veterans think is the best practice..

However, if string manipulation works for you, then go for it! There are plenty of cases where small or simple XML text can be safely built by hand.</p>\n\n<p>Just be aware that creating XML text is harder than it looks. Here\'s some criteria I would consider:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>First: how much <em>control</em> do you have on the information that goes into the xml?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The less control you have on the source data, the more likely you will have trouble, and the more advantageous the library becomes. For example: (a) Can you <em>guarantee</em> that the element names will never have a character that is illegal in a name? (b) How about quotes in an attribute\'s content? Can they happen, and are you handling them? (c) Does the data ever contain anything that might need to be encoded as an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_entity\" rel=\"nofollow\">entity</a> (like the less-than which often needs to be output as <strong>&amp;lt;</strong>); are you doing it correctly?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Second, maintainability: is the code that builds the XML easy to understand <em>by someone else</em>?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You probably don\'t want to be stuck with the code for life. I\'ve worked with second-hand C++ code that hand-builds XML and it can be surprisingly obscure. Of course, if this is a personal project of yours, then you don\'t need to worry about \"others\": substitute \"in a year\" for \"others\" above.</p>\n\n<p>I wouldn\'t worry about performance. If your XML is simple enough that you can hand-write it, any overhead from the library is probably meaningless. Of course, your case might be different, but you should measure to prove it first.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Yes; you can hand build XML text by hand if it\'s simple enough; but not knowing the libraries available is <em>probably</em> not the right reason.</p>\n\n<p>A modern XML library is a quite powerful tool, but it can also be daunting. However, learning the essentials of your XML library is not that hard, and it can be quite handy; among other things, it\'s almost a requisite in today\'s job marketplace.

This will also allow you to take advantage of NIO\'s improved performance over traditional java stream-based i/o, without any weird hacks.  </p>\n\n<p>The only two catches that I can think of are: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>On 32-bit system, you are limited to  just under 4GB <em>total for all mapped byte buffers</em>.  (That is actually a limit for my application, and I now run on 64-bit architectures.)</li>\n<li>Implementation is JVM specific and not a requirement.

The Java Serialization, like pretty much everything in Javaland, is standardized. So, you <em>could</em> implement a deserializer according to that standard in Python. However, the Java Serialization format is not designed for cross-language use, the serialization format is closely tied to the way objects are represented inside the JVM. While implementing a JVM in Python is surely a fun exercise, it\'s probably not what you\'re looking for (-:</p>\n\n<p>There are other (data) serialization formats that are specifically designed to be language agnostic. They usually work by stripping the data formats down to the bare minimum (number, string, sequence, dictionary and that\'s it) and thus requiring a bit of work on both ends to represent a rich object as a graph of dumb data structures (and vice versa).</p>\n\n<p>Two examples are <a href=\"http://JSON.Org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)\">JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</a> and <a href=\"http://YAML.Org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"YAML (YAML Ain\'t Markup Language)\">YAML (YAML Ain\'t Markup Language)</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://ASN1.Elibel.Tm.Fr/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One)\">ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One)</a> is another data serialization format. Instead of dumbing the format down to a point where it can be easily understood, ASN.1 is self-describing, meaning all the information needed to decode a stream is encoded within the stream itself.</p>\n\n<p>And, of course, <a href=\"http://W3.Org/XML/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"XML (eXtensible Markup Language)\">XML (eXtensible Markup Language)</a>, will work too, provided that it is not just used to provide textual representation of a \"memory dump\" of a Java object, but an actual abstract, language-agnostic encoding.</p>\n\n<p>So, to make a long story short: your best bet is to either try to coerce log4j into logging in one of the above-mentioned formats, replace log4j with something that does that or try to somehow intercept the objects before they are sent over the wire and convert them before leaving Javaland.</p>\n\n<p>Libraries that implement JSON, YAML, ASN.1 and XML are available for both Java and Python (and pretty much every programming language known to man).</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(29573,'A',29461,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-08-27 05:11:00',NULL,'E','','<p>I don\'t know anything about groovy so in a sense I\'ve qualified to answer this...</p>\n\n<p>I would want you to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Tell me why I would want to use Scripting (in general) as opposed to Java-- what does it let me do quicker (as in development time), what does it make more readable.

Instead, the word “templates” is used and is more accurate. Templates describes one <em>technique</em> to achieve a generic design.</p>\n\n<p>C++ templates is very different from what both C# and Java implement for two main reasons. The first reason is that C++ templates don\'t only allow compile-time type arguments but also compile-time const-value arguments: templates can be given as integers or even function signatures. This means that you can do some quite funky stuff at compile time, e.g. calculations:</p>\n\n<pre><code>template &lt;unsigned int N&gt;\nstruct product {\n    static unsigned int const VALUE = N * product&lt;N - 1&gt;::VALUE;\n};\n\ntemplate &lt;&gt;\nstruct product&lt;1&gt; {\n    static unsigned int const VALUE = 1;\n};\n\n// Usage:\nunsigned int const p5 = product&lt;5&gt;::VALUE;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This code also uses the other distinguished feature of C++ templates, namely template specialization. The code defines one class template, <code>product</code> that has one value argument. It also defines a specialization for that template that is used whenever the argument evaluates to 1. This allows me to define a recursion over template definitions. I believe that this was first discovered by <a href=\"http://erdani.org/\">Andrei Alexandrescu</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Template specialization is important for C++ because it allows for structural differences in data structures. Templates as a whole is a means of unifying an interface across types. However, although this is desirable, all types cannot be treated equally inside the implementation. C++ templates takes this into account. This is very much the same difference that OOP makes between interface and implementation with the overriding of virtual methods.</p>\n\n<p>C++ templates are essential for its algorithmic programming paradigm. For example, almost all algorithms for containers are defined as functions that accept the container type as a template type and treat them uniformly. Actually, that\'s not quite right: C++ doesn\'t work on containers but rather on <em>ranges</em> that are defined by two iterators, pointing to the beginning and behind the end of the container. Thus, the whole content is circumscribed by the iterators: begin &lt;= elements &lt; end.</p>\n\n<p>Using iterators instead of containers is useful because it allows to operate on parts of a container instead of on the whole.</p>\n\n<p>Another distinguishing feature of C++ is the possibility of <em>partial specialization</em> for class templates. This is somewhat related to pattern matching on arguments in Haskell and other functional languages. For example, let\'s consider a class that stores elements:</p>\n\n<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;\nclass Store { … }; // (1)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works for any element type. But let\'s say that we can store pointers more effciently than other types by applying some special trick. We can do this by <em>partially</em> specializing for all pointer types:</p>\n\n<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;\nclass Store&lt;T*&gt; { … }; // (2)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, whenever we instance a container template for one type, the appropriate definition is used:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Store&lt;int&gt; x; // Uses (1)\nStore&lt;int*&gt; y; // Uses (2)\nStore&lt;string**&gt; z; // Uses (2), with T = string*.\n</code></pre>\n','',NULL,'@'),(31778,'A',31693,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-08-28 07:22:00',NULL,'E','','<p>In Java, generics are compiler level only, so you get:</p>\n\n<pre><code>a = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;()\na.getClass() =&gt; ArrayList\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that the type of \'a\' is an array list, not a list of strings.

For other languages the parsing would be straightforward but for C++, quite a bit of evaluation is needed beforehand.</p>\n\n<p>It gets worse. What if <code>my_int_type</code> were defined inside a class template as well? Now its type would depend on another type argument. And here, even compilers fail.</p>\n\n<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;\nstruct Y {\n    typedef T my_type;\n};\n\nX&lt;Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type&gt; b;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After a bit of thinking, a programmer would conclude that this code is the same as the above: <code>Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type</code> resolves to <code>int</code>, therefore <code>b</code> should be the same type as <code>a</code>, right?</p>\n\n<p>Wrong. At the point where the compiler tries to resolve this statement, it doesn\'t actually know <code>Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type</code> yet! Therefore, it doesn\'t know that this is a type. It could be something else, e.g. a member function or a field. This might give rise to ambiguities (though not in the present case), therefore the compiler fails. We have to tell it explicitly that we refer to a type name:</p>\n\n<pre><code>X&lt;typename Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type&gt; b;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, the code compiles. To see how ambiguities arise from this situation, consider the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type(123);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This code statement is perfectly valid and tells C++ to execute the function call to <code>Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type</code>. However, if <code>my_type</code> is not a function but rather a type, this statement would still be valid and perform a special cast (the function-style cast) which is often a constructor invocation.

There\'s no casting or any other stuff, and because the dll contains the information that this is a List of <code>Person</code>, other code that looks at it later on using reflection can tell that it contains <code>Person</code> objects (so you get intellisense and so on).</p>\n\n<p>The downside of this is that old C# 1.0 and 1.1 code (before they added generics) doesn\'t understand these new <code>List&lt;something&gt;</code>, so you have to manually convert things back to plain old <code>List</code> to interoperate with them. This is not that big of a problem, because C# 2.0 binary code is not backwards compatible. The only time this will ever happen is if you\'re upgrading some old C# 1.0/1.1 code to C# 2.0</p>\n\n<h2>Java Generics allow you to declare something like this.</h2>\n\n<pre><code>ArrayList&lt;Person&gt; foo = new ArrayList&lt;Person&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>On the surface it looks the same, and it sort-of is. The compiler will also prevent you from putting things that aren\'t <code>Person</code> into the list.</p>\n\n<p>The difference is what happens behind the scenes. Unlike C#, Java does not go and build a special <code>ListOfPerson</code> - it just uses the plain old <code>ArrayList</code> which has always been in Java. When you get things out of the array, the usual <code>Person p = (Person)foo.get(1);</code> casting-dance still has to be done. The compiler is saving you the key-presses, but the speed hit/casting is still incurred just like it always was.<br>\nWhen people mention \"Type Erasure\" this is what they\'re talking about. The compiler inserts the casts for you, and then \'erases\' the fact that it\'s meant to be a list of <code>Person</code> not just <code>Object</code></p>\n\n<p>The benefit of this approach is that old code which doesn\'t understand generics doesn\'t have to care. It\'s still dealing with the same old <code>ArrayList</code> as it always has. This is more important in the java world because they wanted to support compiling code using Java 5 with generics, and having it run on old 1.4 or previous JVM\'s, which microsoft deliberately decided not to bother with.</p>\n\n<p>The downside is the speed hit I mentioned previously, and also because there is no <code>ListOfPerson</code> pseudo-class or anything like that going into the .class files, code that looks at it later on (with reflection, or if you pull it out of another collection where it\'s been converted into <code>Object</code> or so on) can\'t tell in any way that it\'s meant to be a list containing only <code>Person</code> and not just any other array list.</p>\n\n<h2>C++ Templates allow you to declare something like this</h2>\n\n<pre><code>std::list&lt;Person&gt;* foo = new std::list&lt;Person&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It looks like C# and Java generics, and it will do what you think it should do, but behind the scenes different things are happening.</p>\n\n<p>It has the most in common with C# generics in that it builds special <code>pseudo-classes</code> rather than just throwing the type information away like java does, but it\'s a whole different kettle of fish.</p>\n\n<p>Both C# and Java produce output which is designed for virtual machines. If you write some code which has a <code>Person</code> class in it, in both cases some information about a <code>Person</code> class will go into the .dll or .class file, and the JVM/CLR will do stuff with this.</p>\n\n<p>C++ produces raw x86 binary code. Everything is <em>not</em> an object, and there\'s no underlying virtual machine which needs to know about a <code>Person</code> class. There\'s no boxing or unboxing, and functions don\'t have to belong to classes, or indeed anything. </p>\n\n<p>Because of this, the C++ compiler places no restrictions on what you can do with templates - basically any code you could write manually, you can get templates to write for you.<br>\nThe most obvious example is adding things:</p>\n\n<p>In C# and Java, the generics system needs to know what methods are available for a class, and it needs to pass this down to the virtual machine. The only way to tell it this is by either hard-coding the actual class in, or using interfaces. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int addNames&lt;T&gt;( T first, T second ) { return first.Name() + second.Name(); }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That code won\'t compile in C# or Java, because it doesn\'t know that the type <code>T</code> actually provides a method called Name(). You have to tell it - in C# like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>interface IHasName{ string Name(); };\nint addNames&lt;T&gt;( T first, T second ) where T : IHasName { .... }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then you have to make sure the things you pass to addNames implement the IHasName interface and so on. The java syntax is different (<code>&lt;T extends IHasName&gt;</code>), but it suffers from the same problems.</p>\n\n<p>The \'classic\' case for this problem is trying to write a function which does this</p>\n\n<pre><code>int addNames&lt;T&gt;( T first, T second ) { return first + second; }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can\'t actually write this code because there are no ways to declare an interface with the <code>+</code> method in it. You fail.</p>\n\n<p>C++ suffers from none of these problems. The compiler doesn\'t care about passing types down to any VM\'s - if both your objects have a .Name() function, it will compile. If they don\'t, it won\'t. Simple.</p>\n\n<p>So, there you have it :-)</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(31946,'A',29689,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-08-28 10:02:00','2012-12-01 20:05:00','E','','<p>The <a href=\"http://jautodoc.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">JAutodoc</a> plugin for eclipse does exactly what you need, but with a package granularity : </p>\n\n<p>right click on a package, select \"Add javadoc for members...\" and the skeleton will be added.</p>\n\n<p>There are numerous interesting options : templates for javadoc, adding a TODO in the header of every file saying : \"template javadoc, must be filled...\", etc.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(31952,'A',29689,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-08-28 10:06:00',NULL,'E','','<p>You can configure eclipse to show warnings for things that lack javadoc, or have javadoc that does not have all the information, or has wrong information.

Here is a concrete example.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose I have a web application, built using Struts2 and Hibernate. If an exception bubbles up to my \"action\", I log it, and display a pretty apology to the user. But one of the functions of my web application is creating new user accounts, that require a unique user name. If a user picks a name that already exists, Hibernate throws an <code>org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException</code> (an unchecked exception) down in the guts of my system. I\'d really like to recover from this particular problem by asking the user to choose another user name, rather than giving them the same \"we logged your problem but for now you\'re hosed\" message.</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few points to consider:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There a lot of people creating accounts simultaneously.

So, for example, in checked-exception land, a file-system&ndash;based implementation of my UserRegistry might catch <code>IOException</code>, while a database implementation would catch <code>SQLException</code>, but both would throw a <code>UserNotFoundException</code> that hides the underlying implementation.

Basically, you have to consider the exceptions that the code you call may throw, and in turn you\'ll consider the exceptions you\'ll throw for the code that calls yours.</p>\n\n<p>2) It gives you the opportunity to add additional debugging information into the exception chain. For instance, if you have a method that throws an exception on a duplicate username, you might wrap that exception with one that includes additional information about the circumstances of the failure (for example, the IP of the request that provided the dupe username) that wasn\'t available to the lower-level code. The cookie trail of exceptions may help you debug a complex problem (it certainly has for me).</p>\n\n<p>3) It lets you become implementation-independent from the lower level code. If you\'re wrapping exceptions and need to swap out Hibernate for some other ORM, you only have to change your Hibernate-handling code. All the other layers of code will still be successfully using the wrapped exceptions and will interpret them in the same way, even though the underlying circumstances have changed. Note that this applies even if Hibernate changes in some way (ex: they switch exceptions in a new version); it\'s not just for wholesale technology replacement.</p>\n\n<p>4) It encourages you use different classes of exceptions to represent different situations. For example, you may have a DuplicateUsernameException when the user tries to reuse a username, and a DatabaseFailureException when you can\'t check for dupe usernames due to a broken DB connection. This, in turn, lets you answer your question (\"how do I recover?\") in flexible and powerful ways.

However, the question is: why would anyone do that? It doesn\'t make sense! Or does it?</p>\n\n<p>Well, what\'s the alternative? If you don\'t implement generics in the language, where <em>do</em> you implement them? And the answer is: in the Virtual Machine. Which breaks backwards compatibility.</p>\n\n<p>Type erasure, on the other hand, allows you to mix generic clients with non-generic libraries. In other words: code that was compiled on Java 5 can still be deployed to Java 1.4.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft, however, decided to break backwards compatibility for generics. <em>That\'s</em> why .NET Generics are \"better\" than Java Generics.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, Sun aren\'t idiots or cowards. The reason why they \"chickened out\", was that Java was significantly older and more widespread than .NET when they introduced generics. (They were introduced roughly at the same time in both worlds.) Breaking backwards compatibility would have been a huge pain.</p>\n\n<p>Put yet another way: in Java, Generics are a part of the <em>Language</em> (which means they apply <em>only</em> to Java, not to other languages), in .NET they are part of the <em>Virtual Machine</em> (which means they apply to <em>all</em> languages, not just C# and Visual Basic.NET).</p>\n\n<p>Compare this with .NET features like LINQ, lambda expressions, local variable type inference, anonymous types and expression trees: these are all <em>language</em> features. That\'s why there are subtle differences between VB.NET and C#: if those features were part of the VM, they would be the same in <em>all</em> languages. But the CLR hasn\'t changed: it\'s still the same in .NET 3.5 SP1 as it was in .NET 2.0. You can compile a C# program that uses LINQ with the .NET 3.5 compiler and still run it on .NET 2.0, provided that you don\'t use any .NET 3.5 libraries. That would <em>not</em> work with generics and .NET 1.1, but it <em>would</em> work with Java and Java 1.4.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(33751,'Q',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,0,33767,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,3109,-7.19053e+09,0,'html','2008-08-29 01:25:00',NULL,'E','How do I add a MIME type to .htaccess?','<p>I would like to add the following MIME type to a site run by Apache:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;mime-mapping&gt;\n  &lt;extension&gt;jnlp&lt;/extension&gt;\n  &lt;mime-type&gt;application/x-java-jnlp-file&lt;/mime-type&gt;\n&lt;/mime-mapping&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(That is the Tomcat format.)</p>\n\n<p>I\'m on a shared host, so I can only create an .htaccess file.

The UIComponent tree is rebuilt.</li>\n<li><strong>Apply Request Values</strong>. Editable components should implement EditableValueHolder.

If the component isn\'t something complex like a UIData, it won\'t do much except call its own <em>decode</em> method. The <em>decode</em> method doesn\'t do much except find its renderer and invokes its <em>decode</em> method, passing itself as an argument. It is the renderer\'s job to get any submitted value and set it via <em>setSubmittedValue</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Process Validations</strong>. This phase calls <em>processValidators</em> which will call <em>validate</em>. The <em>validate</em> method takes the submitted value, converts it with any converters, validates it with any validators and (assuming the data passes those tests) calls <em>setValue</em>. This will store the value as a local variable. While this local variable is not null, it will be returned and not the value from the value binding for any calls to <em>getValue</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Update Model Values</strong>. This phase calls <em>processUpdates</em>. In an input component, this will call <em>updateModel</em> which will get the <em>ValueExpression</em> and invoke it to set the value on the model.</li>\n<li><strong>Invoke Application</strong>. Button event listeners and so on will be invoked here (as will navigation if memory serves).</li>\n<li><strong>Render Response</strong>. The tree is rendered via the renderers and the state saved.</li>\n<li>If any of these phases fail (e.g. a value is invalid), the lifecycle skips to Render Response.</li>\n<li>Various events can be fired after most of these phases, invoking listeners as appropriate (like value change listeners after Process Validations).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is a somewhat simplified version of events.

The end user must be able to download the file from there browser using HTTP.  I don\'t think Flash or Silverlight can save files to the client so as far as I know they won\'t cut it.</p>\n\n<p>I\'m guessing we will need an ActiveX or Java applet to pull this off.  Something like the download manager that MSDN uses.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know of a commercial (or free) component that will do that?  We do not want the user to have to install a \"browser wide\" download manager (like GetRight), we want it to only work with downloading on our site. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Here is some additional info to help clarify what I\'m trying to do.  Most of the files above the 4GB limit would be large HD video files (its for a video editing company).  These will be downloaded by users across the internet, this isn\'t going to be people on a local network.  We want the files to be available via HTTP (some users are going to be behind firewalls that aren\'t going to allow FTP, Bittorrent, etc.).  The will be a library of files the end user could download, so we aren\'t talking about a one time large download.  The will be download different large files on a semi-regular basis.</p>\n\n<p>So far Vault that @Edmund-Tay suggested is the closest solution so far.  The only problem is that it doesn\'t work for files larger than 4GB (it instantly fails before starting the download, they are probably using a 32bit integer somewhere that the content length of the file exceeds).</p>\n\n<p>A java applet (or ActiveX component since the problem only exist in IE) that worked like the article @spoulson linked to would be the best solution, but so far I haven\'t had any luck finding one that does anything like that (multipart downloads, resume, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>It looks like we might have to write our own.  Another option would be to write a .Net application (maybe ClickOnce) that is associated with an extension or mime type.  Then the user would actually be downloading a small file from the web server that opens in the exe/ClickOnce app that tells the application what file to download.  That is how the MSDN downloader works.  The end user would then only have to download/install an EXE once.  That would be better than downloading an exe every time they wanted to download a large file.</p>\n','java,flash,silverlight,browser',NULL,'@'),(35252,'A',35248,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-08-29 20:35:00','2008-08-29 20:40:00','E','','<p><a href=\"http://www.bittorrent.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">bittorrent</a>?</p>\n\n<p>There have been a few web-based versions already (<a href=\"http://www.bitlet.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">bitlet</a>, <a href=\"http://torrentfreak.com/w3btorrent-a-bittorrent-client-for-your-web-server/\" rel=\"nofollow\">w3btorrent</a>), and <a href=\"http://azureus.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Azureus</a> was built using java, so it\'s definitely possible.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: @<a href=\"#35258\" rel=\"nofollow\">TonyB</a> is it limited to port 80?</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(35257,'A',35248,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-08-29 20:38:00',NULL,'E','','<p>Please don\'t use ActiveX...

After a quick research I found <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/docs/hotspot/gc5.0/ergo5.html\">Ergonomics in the 5.0 Java Virtual Machine</a> and others saying on Windows machine the JVM defaults max heap size as 64MB.</p>\n\n<p>Given this situation, how should I deal with this constraint?</p>\n\n<p>I could increase the max heap size using command line option to java, but that would require figuring out available RAM and writing some launching program or script. Besides, increasing to some finite max does not ultimately get rid of the issue.</p>\n\n<p>I could rewrite some of my code to persist objects to file system frequently (using database is the same thing) to free up the memory. It could work, but it\'s probably a lot work too.</p>\n\n<p>If you could point me to details of above ideas or some alternatives like automatic virtual memory, extending heap size dynamically, that will be great.</p>\n','java,jvm,heap,tuning,outofmemoryerror',NULL,'@'),(37349,'A',37335,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-09-01 01:29:00',NULL,'E','','<p>Ultimately you always have a finite max of heap to use no matter what platform you are running on. In Windows 32 bit this is around 2gb (not specifically heap but total amount of memory per process). It just happens that Java happens to make the default smaller (presumably so that the programmer can\'t create programs that have runaway memory allocation without running into this problem and having to examine exactly what they are doing).</p>\n\n<p>So this given there are several approaches you could take to either determine what amount of memory you need or to reduce the amount of memory you are using. One common mistake with garbage collected languages such as Java or C# is to keep around references to objects that you no longer are using, or allocating many objects when you could reuse them instead. As long as objects have a reference to them they will continue to use heap space as the garbage collector will not delete them.</p>\n\n<p>In this case you can use a Java memory profiler to determine what methods in your program are allocating large number of objects and then determine if there is a way to make sure they are no longer referenced, or to not allocate them in the first place. One option which I have used in the past is \"JMP\" <a href=\"http://www.khelekore.org/jmp/\">http://www.khelekore.org/jmp/</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you determine that you are allocating these objects for a reason and you need to keep around references (depending on what you are doing this might be the case), you will just need to increase the max heap size when you start the program. However, once you do the memory profiling and understand how your objects are getting allocated you should have a better idea about how much memory you need. </p>\n\n<p>In general if you can\'t guarantee that your program will run in some finite amount of memory (perhaps depending on input size) you will always run into this problem. Only after exhausting all of this will you need to look into caching objects out to disk etc. At this point you should have a very good reason to say \"I need Xgb of memory\" for something and you can\'t work around it by improving your algorithms or memory allocation patterns. Generally this will only usually be the case for algorithms operating on large datasets (like a database or some scientific analysis program) and then techniques like caching and memory mapped IO become useful.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(37355,'A',37271,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-09-01 01:43:00',NULL,'E','','<p>In my experience, you\'re probably better off using an embedded database.

In dynamically typed languages, the use case described above is less necessary (since the compiler will allow any method to be called on any object, failing at runtime if it does not exist), but the second case of looking for methods which are marked or work in a certain way is still common.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(37634,'A',37628,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-09-01 08:50:00',NULL,'E','','<p>Reflection is a set of functions which allows you to access the runtime information of your program and modify it behavior (with some limitations).</p>\n\n<p>It\'s useful because it allows you to change the runtime behaivour depending on the meta information of your program, that is, you can check the return type of a function and change the way you handle the situation.</p>\n\n<p>In C# for example you can load an assembly (a .dll) in runtime an examine it, navigating through the classes and taking actions according to what you found.

After having made the painful switch from Tapestry 3 to Tapestry 4, I felt that I had been abandoned almost immediately.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, with the release of Tapestry 5, Tapestry 4 became a legacy product. I wouldn\'t have a problem with this if the upgrade path wasn\'t so brutal <strong>again</strong>. So now our development team is in the rather unenviable position: We could continue to use an essentially abandoned web platform (Tapestry 4), make the heinous upgrade to Tapestry 5, or give up on Tapestry entirely and rewrite our application using another platform. None of these options is very attractive.</p>\n\n<p>Tapestry 5 is supposedly written so as to reduce the likelihood of update breakage from this point forward. A good example is in the page classes: in previous incarnations, page classes descended from a base class provided by Tapestry; incompatible API changes in this class were the cause of a large number of backward compatibility problems. In Tapestry 5, pages are POJOs which are enhanced at runtime with the \"magic Tapestry fairy dust\" via annotations. So as long as the contract for the annotations is maintained, changes to Tapestry won\'t affect your page classes.</p>\n\n<p>If this is right, then writing a new application using Tapestry 5 could turn out well. But personally, I don\'t feel like putting my hand on the burner again.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(40210,'A',39194,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-09-02 18:27:00',NULL,'E','','<p>Technically, you don\'t need a Mac.

This shows you what objects are using the most memory. But the objects aren\'t lumped together solely by type: each entry also includes a \"trace\" ID. You can then search for that \"TRACE nnnn\" to see the top few frames of the stack where the object was allocated. Often, once I see where the object is allocated, I find a bug and I\'m done. Also, note that you can control how many frames are recorded in the stack with the options to -Xrunhprof.</p>\n\n<p>If you check out the allocation site, and don\'t see anything wrong, you have to start backward chaining from some of those live objects to root objects, to find the unexpected reference chain. This is where a tool really helps, but you can do the same thing by hand (well, with grep). There is not just one root object (i.e., object not subject to garbage collection). Threads, classes, and stack frames act as root objects, and anything they reference strongly is not collectible.</p>\n\n<p>To do the chaining, look in the HEAP DUMP section for entries with the bad trace id. This will take you to an OBJ or ARR entry, which shows a unique object identifier in hexadecimal. Search for all occurrences of that id to find who\'s got a strong reference to the object.

The company is rather small in size and has pretty strong \"start-up\" feel to it. I\'m working as a Java developer on a team of 3 others. The company primarily sells a service to for businesses/business-type people to use in communicating with each other.</p>\n\n<p>One of the main things I have been, and will be working on, is the main website for the company - from which the service is sold, existing users login to check their service and pay their bills, new users can sign up for a trial, etc. Currently this is a JSP application deployed on Tomcat, with access to a database done thru a persistence layer written by the company itself.</p>\n\n<p>A repeated and growing frustration I am having here (and I\'m pretty happy with the job overall, so this isn\'t an \"oh no I don\'t like my job\"-type post) is the lack of any larger design or architecture for this web application. The app is made up of several dozen JSP pages, with almost no logic existing in Servlets or Beans or any other sort of framework. Many of the JSP pages are thousands of lines of code, they <code>jsp:include</code> other JSP pages, business logic is mixed in with the HTML, frequently used snippets of code (such as obtaining a web service connection) is cut and paste rather than reused, etc. In other words, the application is a mess.</p>\n\n<p>There have been some rumblings within the company of trying to re-architect this site so that it fits MVC better; I think that the developers and higher-ups are beginning to realize that this current pattern of spaghetti code isn\'t sustainable or very easily scalable to add more features for the users. The higher-ups and developers are wary of completely re-writing the thing (with good reason, since this would mean several weeks or months of work re-writing existing functionality), but we\'ve had some discussions of (slowly) re-writing certain areas of the site into a new framework.</p>\n\n<p>What are some of the best strategies to enable moving the application and codebase into this direction? How can I as a developer really help move this along, and quickly, without seeming like the jerk-y new guy who comes into a job and tells everyone that what they\'ve written is crap?

Then java has objects (everything that derives from <code>java.lang.Object</code>). Objects are actually always handled through a reference (a reference being a pointer that you can\'t touch). That means that in effect, objects are passed by value, as the references are normally not interesting. It does however mean that you cannot change which object is pointed to as the reference itself is passed by value.</p>\n\n<p>Does this sound strange and confusing? Let\'s consider how C implements pass by reference and pass by value. In C the default convention is pass by value. <code>void foo(int x)</code> passes an int by value. <code>void foo(int *x)</code> is a function that does not want an <code>int a</code>, but a pointer to an int: <code>foo(&amp;a)</code>. One would use this with the <code>&amp;</code> operator to pass a variable address.</p>\n\n<p>Take this to C++, and we have references. References are basically (in this context) syntactic sugar that hide the pointer part of the equation: <code>void foo(int &amp;x)</code> is called by <code>foo(a)</code>, where the compiler itself knows that it is a reference and the address of the non-reference <code>a</code> should be passed. In java, all variables referring to objects are actually of reference type, in effect forcing call by reference for most intends and purposes without the fine grained control (and complexity) afforded by e.g. C++.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(40636,'A',33497,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-09-02 20:56:00',NULL,'E','','<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33497/how-do-i-recover-from-an-unchecked-exception#39769\" rel=\"nofollow\">@Jan</a> Checked versus unchecked is a central issue here.

However, on most of the projects I have worked on we end up forgetting to do that, and end up with a mess of packages without that top-level structure. This anti-pattern usually shows itself as a package for something like \'listeners\' or \'actions\' that groups otherwise unrelated classes simply because they happen to implement the same interface.</p>\n\n<p>Within a module, or in a small application, use packages for the application layers. Likely packages include things like the following, depending on the architecture:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.view</em></li>\n<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.model</em></li>\n<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.services</em></li>\n<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.rules</em></li>\n<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.persistence</em> (or \'dao\' for data access layer)</li>\n<li><em>com.mycompany.myapp.util</em> (beware of this being used as if it were \'misc\')</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Within each of these layers, it is natural to group classes by type if there are a lot. A common anti-pattern here is to unnecessarily introduce too many packages and levels of sub-package so that there are only a few classes in each package.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(43802,'Q',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,4,0,43807,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,19786,-3.74548e+08,0,'html','2008-09-04 13:54:00','2011-09-29 21:39:00','E','How to convert a date String to a Date or Calendar object?','<p>I have a <code>String</code> representation of a date that I need to create a <code>Date</code> or <code>Calendar</code> object from.

In contrast, the <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/IllegalArgumentException.html\">IAE JavaDo</a>c couldn\'t be more clear: \"Thrown to indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument.\"  Yup, that\'s you!</p>\n\n<p>Second, when you see an NPE in a stack trace, what do you assume?  Probably that someone dereferenced a null.  When you see IAE, you assume the caller of the method at the top of the stack passed in an illegal value.  Again, the latter assumption is true, the former is misleading.</p>\n\n<p>Third, since IAE is clearly designed for validating parameters, you have to assume it as the default choice of exception, so why would you choose NPE instead?  Certainly not for different behavior -- do you really expect calling code to catch NPE\'s separately from IAE and do something different as a result?  Are you trying to communicate a more specific error message?  But you can do that in the exception message text anyway, as you should for all other incorrect parameters.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, all other incorrect parameter data will be IAE, so why not be consistent?  Why is it that an illegal <code>null</code> is so special that it deserves a separate exception from all other types of illegal arguments?</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I accept the argument given by other answers that parts of the Java API use NPE in this manner.

While some processors include the\n  instructions for their predecessors,\n  it\'s generally true that a program\n  that runs on one kind of computer\n  won\'t run on any other. Add in the\n  services provided by the operating\n  system, which each system describes in\n  its own unique way, and you have a\n  compatibility problem. In general, you\n  can\'t write and compile a program for\n  one kind of system and run it on any\n  other without a lot of work. Java gets\n  around this limitation by inserting\n  its virtual machine between the\n  application and the real environment\n  (computer + operating system). If an\n  application is compiled to Java byte\n  code and that byte code is interpreted\n  the same way in every environment then\n  you can write a single program which\n  will work on all the different\n  platforms where Java is supported.\n  (That\'s the theory, anyway. In\n  practice there are always small\n  incompatibilities lying in wait for\n  the programmer.)</p></li>\n  <li><p><strong>Security</strong>: One of Java\'s virtues is its integration into the Web. Load\n  a web page that uses Java into your\n  browser and the Java code is\n  automatically downloaded and executed.\n  But what if the code destroys files,\n  whether through malice or sloppiness\n  on the programmer\'s part? Java\n  prevents downloaded applets from doing\n  anything destructive by disallowing\n  potentially dangerous operations.\n  Before it allows the code to run it\n  examines it for attempts to bypass\n  security. It verifies that data is\n  used consistently: code that\n  manipulates a data item as an integer\n  at one stage and then tries to use it\n  as a pointer later will be caught and\n  prevented from executing. (The Java\n  language doesn\'t allow pointer\n  arithmetic, so you can\'t write Java\n  code to do what we just described.\n  However, there is nothing to prevent\n  someone from writing destructive byte\n  code themselves using a hexadecimal\n  editor or even building a Java byte\n  code assembler.) It generally isn\'t\n  possible to analyze a program\'s\n  machine code before execution and\n  determine whether it does anything\n  bad. Tricks like writing\n  self-modifying code mean that the evil\n  operations may not even exist until\n  later. But Java byte code was designed\n  for this kind of validation: it\n  doesn\'t have the instructions a\n  malicious programmer would use to hide\n  their assault.</p></li>\n  <li><p><strong>Size</strong>: In the microprocessor world RISC is generally preferable\n  over CISC. It\'s better to have a small\n  instruction set and use many fast\n  instructions to do a job than to have\n  many complex operations implemented as\n  single instructions. RISC designs\n  require fewer gates on the chip to\n  implement their instructions, allowing\n  for more room for pipelines and other\n  techniques to make each instruction\n  faster. In an interpreter, however,\n  none of this matters. If you want to\n  implement a single instruction for the\n  switch statement with a variable\n  length depending on the number of case\n  clauses, there\'s no reason not to do\n  so. In fact, a complex instruction set\n  is an advantage for a web-based\n  language: it means that the same\n  program will be smaller (fewer\n  instructions of greater complexity),\n  which means less time to transfer\n  across our speed-limited network.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So when considering byte code vs native, consider which trade-offs you want to make between portability, security, size, and execution speed. If speed is the only important factor, go native. If any of the others are more important, go with bytecode.</p>\n\n<p>I\'ll also add that maintaining a series of OS and architecture-targeted compilations of the same code base for every release can become very tedious. It\'s a huge win to use the same Java bytecode on multiple platforms and have it \"just work.\"</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(48156,'A',48144,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-09-07 04:50:00',NULL,'E','','<p>Ideally you would have portable bytecode that compiles Just In Time to native code.

I really didn\'t want to like write a windows service.  I felt like that was out of band code. Plus the code that actually does the work is a web page in fact, because to me that is a logical unit of work on a website is a web page.  So, it really is like we are calling back into the web site, it\'s just like another request in the website, so I viewed it as something that should stay inline, and the little approach that we came up that was recommended to me on Twitter was to essentially to add something to the application cache with a fixed expiration, then you have a call back so when that expires it calls a certain function which does the work then you add it back in to the cache with the same expiration.  So, it\'s a little bit, maybe \"ghetto\" is the right word.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My approach has always been to have to OS (i.e. Cron or the Windows task scheduler) load a specific URL at some interval, and then setup a page at that URL to check it\'s queue, and perform whatever tasks were required, but I\'d be interested to hear if there\'s a better way.</p>\n\n<p>From the transcript, it looks like FogBugz uses the windows service loading a URL approach also.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Spolsky: So we have this special page called heartbeat.asp.  And that page, whenever you hit it, and anybody can hit it at anytime: doesn\'t hurt.  But when that page runs it checks a queue of waiting tasks to see if there\'s anything that needs to be done.  And if there\'s anything that needs to be done, it does one thing and then looks in that queue again and if there\'s anything else to be done it returns a plus, and the entire web page that it returns is just a single character with a plus in it.  And if there\'s nothing else to be done, the queue is now empty, it returns a minus.  So, anybody can call this and hit it as many times, you can load up heartbeat.asp in your web browser you hit Ctrl-R Ctrl-R Ctrl-R Ctrl-R until you start getting minuses instead of pluses.  And when you\'ve done that FogBugz will have completed all of its maintenance work that it needs to do.  So that\'s the first part, and the second part is a very, very simple Windows service which runs, and its whole job is to call heartbeat.asp and if it gets a plus, call it again soon, and if it gets a minus call it again, but not for a while.  So basically there\'s this Windows service that\'s always running, that has a very, very, very simple task of just hitting a URL, and looking to see if it gets a plus or a minus and, and then scheduling when it runs again based on whether it got a plus or a minus.  And obviously you can do any kind of variation you want on this theme, like for example, uh you could actually, instead of returning just a plus or minus you could say \"Okay call me back in 60 seconds\" or \"Call me back right away I have more work to be done.\"  And that\'s how it works... so that maintenance service it just runs, you know, it\'s like, you know, a half page of code that runs that maintenance service, and it never has to change, and it doesn\'t have any of the logic in there, it just contains the tickling that causes these web pages to get called with a certain guaranteed frequency.  And inside that web page at heartbeat.asp there\'s code that maintains a queue of tasks that need to be done and looks at how much time has elapsed and does, you know, late-night maintenance and every seven days delete all the older messages that have been marked as spam and all kinds of just maintenance background tasks.  And uh, that\'s how that does that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n','',NULL,'@'),(48300,'A',48293,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-09-07 10:37:00',NULL,'E','','<p>Here is how they do it on StackOverflow.com:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/07/easy-background-tasks-in-aspnet/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/07/easy-background-tasks-in-aspnet/</a></p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(48332,'A',48293,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-09-07 11:25:00',NULL,'E','','<p>I think developing a custom solution for running background tasks doesn\'t always worth, so I recommend to use the <a href=\"http://www.opensymphony.com/quartz/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quartz Scheduler</a> in Java.</p>\n\n<p>In your situation (need to run background tasks in a web application) you could use the ServletContextListener included in the distribution to <a href=\"http://www.opensymphony.com/quartz/api/org/quartz/ee/servlet/QuartzInitializerListener.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">initialize the engine at the startup of your web container</a>.</p>\n\n<p>After that you have a number of possibilities to start (trigger) your background tasks (jobs), e.g. you can use Calendars or cron-like expressions.

Once a row is loaded from the DB, any subsequent fetches for a row with the same PK will return the data from this cache. Furthermore, Hibernate gaurentees reference equality for objects with the same PK in a single Session. </p>\n\n<p>From what I understand, your read-only server application never closes its Hibernate session. So when the DB gets updated by the read-write application, the Session on read-only server is unaware of the change. Effectively, your read-only application is loading an in-memory copy of the database and using that copy, which gets stale in due course.</p>\n\n<p>The simplest and best course of action I can suggest is to close and open Sessions as needed. This sidesteps the whole problem. Hibernate Sessions are intended to be a window for a short-lived interaction with the DB. I agree that there is a performance gain by not reloading the object-graph again and again; but you need to measure it and convince yourself that it is worth the pains.</p>\n\n<p>Another option is to close and reopen the Session periodically. This ensures that the read-only application works with data not older than a given time interval. But there definitely is a window where the read-only application works with stale data (although the design guarantees that it gets the up-to-date data eventually). This might be permissible in many applications - you need to evaluate your situation. </p>\n\n<p>The third option is to use a <i>second level cache</i> implementation, and use short-lived Sessions.

In that case I was serving flash (swf) files which were static files in a war. In this use case the images can contain sensitive data so I can\'t change the S3 ACL to public or others could read them. I guess I could temporarily change the ACL to public read for the duration of the read but that\'s a bit of a hack. I wonder if there\'s a way to authenticate a browser to S3 without having an AWS account - that would be the only way to do this properly.

Two of the most I hate are Anonymous Classes and Static Blocks. We have a lot of legacy code that make use of Static Blocks and these are one of the annoying points in our push in writing unit tests. Our goal is to be able to write unit tests for classes that depend on this static initialization with minimal code changes. </p>\n\n<p>So far my suggestion to my colleagues is to move the body of the static block into a private static method and call it <code>staticInit</code>. This method can then be called from within the static block. For unit testing another class that depends on this class could easily mock <code>staticInit</code> with JMockit to not do anything. Let\'s see this in example.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ClassWithStaticInit {\n  static {\n    System.out.println(\"static initializer.\");\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Will be changed to</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ClassWithStaticInit {\n  static {\n    staticInit();\n  }\n\n  private static void staticInit() {\n    System.out.println(\"static initialized.\");\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So that we can do the following in a JUnit.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class DependentClassTest {\n  public static class MockClassWithStaticInit {\n    public static void staticInit() {\n    }\n  }\n\n  @BeforeClass\n  public static void setUpBeforeClass() {\n    Mockit.redefineMethods(ClassWithStaticInit.class, MockClassWithStaticInit.class);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However this solution also comes with its own problems. You can\'t run <code>DependentClassTest</code> and <code>ClassWithStaticInitTest</code> on the same JVM since you actually want the static block to run for <code>ClassWithStaticInitTest</code>.</p>\n\n<p>What would be your way of accomplishing this task?

If your needs are basic and you\'re still using Visual Studio 2005 (.NET framework 2 or older), then go with WSE.

The rules and conventions for naming your variables can be summarized as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Variable names are case-sensitive. A variable\'s name can be any legal identifier — an unlimited-length sequence of Unicode letters and digits, beginning with a letter, the dollar sign \"$\", or the underscore character \"_\". The convention, however, is to always begin your variable names with a letter, not \"$\" or \"_\". Additionally, the dollar sign character, by convention, is never used at all. You may find some situations where auto-generated names will contain the dollar sign, but your variable names should always avoid using it. A similar convention exists for the underscore character; while it\'s technically legal to begin your variable\'s name with \"_\", this practice is discouraged. White space is not permitted.</p></li>\n<li><p>Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscore characters. Conventions (and common sense) apply to this rule as well. When choosing a name for your variables, use full words instead of cryptic abbreviations. Doing so will make your code easier to read and understand. In many cases it will also make your code self-documenting; fields named cadence, speed, and gear, for example, are much more intuitive than abbreviated versions, such as s, c, and g. Also keep in mind that the name you choose must not be a keyword or reserved word.</p></li>\n<li><p>If the name you choose consists of only one word, spell that word in all lowercase letters. If it consists of more than one word, capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word. The names gearRatio and currentGear are prime examples of this convention. If your variable stores a constant value, such as <code>static final int NUM_GEARS = 6</code>, the convention changes slightly, capitalizing every letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore character. By convention, the underscore character is never used elsewhere. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>From the official Java Tutorial</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(65595,'A',63896,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-09-15 18:46:00',NULL,'E','','<p>If all else fails, use <a href=\"http://www.sphinxsearch.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sphinx</a></p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(65610,'A',65200,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-09-15 18:48:00','2012-06-20 18:19:00','E','','<p>The book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Java-Virtual-Machine-Series/dp/1565921941\" rel=\"nofollow\">Java Virtual Machine</a> by Jon Meyer has an example of a series of bytecode instructions that caused the JVM to core dump.

The goal was to obtain a good separation of concerns, thus we defined a project structure using multiple modules (one for each application \'layer\'):\n  - common: common code used by the other layers (e.g., i18n)\n  - entities: the domain entities\n  - repositories: this module contains the daos interfaces and implementations\n  - services-intf: interfaces for the services (e.g, UserService, ...) \n  - services-impl: implementations of the services (e.g, UserServiceImpl) \n  - web: everything regarding the web content (e.g., css, jsps, jsf pages, ...)\n  - ws: web services</p>\n\n<p>Each module has its own dependencies (e.g., repositories could have jpa) and some are project wide (thus they belong in the common module). Dependencies between the different project modules clearly separate things (e.g., the web layer depends on the service layer but doesn\'t know about the repository layer).</p>\n\n<p>Each module has its own base package, for example if the application package is \"com.foo.bar\", then we have:</p>\n\n<pre><code>com.foo.bar.common\ncom.foo.bar.entities\ncom.foo.bar.repositories\ncom.foo.bar.services\ncom.foo.bar.services.impl\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Each module respects the standard maven project structure:</p>\n\n<pre><code>   src\\\n   ..main\\java\n     ...\\resources\n   ..test\\java\n     ...\\resources\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Unit tests for a given layer easily find their place under \\src\\test... Everything that is domain specific has it\'s place in the entities module. Now something like a FileStorageStrategy should go into the repositories module, since we don\'t need to know exactly what the implementation is. In the services layer, we only know the repository interface, we do not care what the specific implementation is (separation of concerns).</p>\n\n<p>There are multiple advantages to this approach:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>clear separation of concerns</li>\n<li>each module is packageable as a jar (or a war in the case of the web module) and thus allows for easier code reuse (e.g., we could install the module in the maven repository and reuse it in another project)</li>\n<li>maximum independence of each part of the project</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I know this doesn\'t answer all your questions, but I think this could put you on the right path and could prove useful to others.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(66834,'A',64833,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-09-15 20:51:00',NULL,'E','','<p>Thanks to Xian, I have a solution.</p>\n\n<p>The wsdl for the service included a line</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;import namespace=\"http://mynamespace.company.com\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The soap that the client sent to the server had the following attribute on all data elements:</p>\n\n<pre><code>xmlns=\"http://mynamespace.company.com\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But the xml payload of the response (from the service back to the client) did <em>not</em> have this namespace included.

In this way you will develop several servlets, or things like servlets, for each page.  I would suggest using a front-controller based framework for this refactoring (from personal experience I recommend Spring and its Controller interface), so that each controller isn\'t a separate Servlet but is rather delegated to from a single servlet that is mapped appropriately.</p>\n\n<p>For the controller, it is better to do database hits all at once rather than attempt them piecemeal.  Users can and generally do tolerate a page load, but the page output will be much faster if all the database data is given to the rendering code rather than the rendering code hanging and not giving data to the client while it is trying to read yet another piece of data from the database.</p>\n\n<p>I feel your pain and wish you luck in this endeavor.

This means we pass 42 to the method.</p>\n\n<p>if the Method were defined as</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void foo(Dog someDog) {\n    someDog.setName(\"Max\");     // AAA\n    someDog = new Dog(\"Fifi\");  // BBB\n    someDog.setName(\"Rowlf\");   // CCC\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>let\'s look at what\'s happening.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the parameter <code>someDog</code> is set to the value 42</li>\n<li>at line \"AAA\"\n<ul>\n<li><code>someDog</code> is followed to the <code>Dog</code> it points to (the <code>Dog</code> object at address 42)</li>\n<li>that <code>Dog</code> (the one at address 42) is asked to change his name to Max</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>at line \"BBB\"\n<ul>\n<li>a new <code>Dog</code> is created. Let\'s say he\'s at address 74</li>\n<li>we assign the parameter <code>someDog</code> to 74 </li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>at line \"CCC\"\n<ul>\n<li>someDog is followed to the <code>Dog</code> it points to (the <code>Dog</code> object at address 74)</li>\n<li>that <code>Dog</code> (the one at address 74) is asked to change his name to Rowlf</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>then, we return</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now let\'s think about what happens outside the method:</p>\n\n<p><em>Did <code>myDog</code> change?</em></p>\n\n<p>There\'s the key.</p>\n\n<p>Keeping in mind that <code>myDog</code> is a <em>pointer</em>, and not an actual <code>Dog</code>, the answer is NO. <code>myDog</code> still has the value 42; it\'s still pointing to the original <code>Dog</code>.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s perfectly valid to <em>follow</em> an address and change what\'s at the end of it; that does not change the variable, however.</p>\n\n<p>Java works exactly like C. You can assign a pointer, pass the pointer to a method, follow the pointer in the method and change the data that was pointed to. However, you cannot change where that pointer points.</p>\n\n<p>In C++, Ada, Pascal and other languages that support pass-by-reference, you can actually change the variable that was passed.</p>\n\n<p>If Java had pass-by-reference semantics, the <code>foo</code> method we defined above would have changed where <code>myDog</code> was pointing when it assigned <code>someDog</code> on line BBB.</p>\n\n<p>Think of reference parameters as being aliases for the variable passed in. When that alias is assigned, so is the variable that was passed in.</p>\n\n<p>Does that help?

I was using PMD for a little while before I noticed the <a href=\"http://pmd.sourceforge.net/cpd.html\">\"Finding Duplicated Code\" link</a> on the <a href=\"http://pmd.sourceforge.net\">PMD web page</a>.</p>\n\n<p><p>I\'d like to point out that these tools can sometimes be extended beyond their \"out-of-the-box\" set of rules. And not just because they\'re open source so that you can rewrite them. Some of these tools come with applications or \"hooks\" that allow them to be extended. For example, PMD comes with the <a href=\"http://pmd.sourceforge.net/howtowritearule.html\">\"designer\" tool</a> that allows you to create new rules. Also, Checkstyle has the <a href=\"http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_misc.html#DescendantToken\">DescendantToken</a> check that has properties that allow for substantial customization.</p>\n\n<p><p>I integrate these tools with <a href=\"http://virtualteamtls.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/virtualteamtls/trunk/scm/common.xml?view=markup\">an Ant-based build</a>. You can follow the link to see my commented configuration.</p>\n\n<p><p>In addition to the simple integration into the build, I find it helpful to configure the tools to be somewhat \"integrated\" in a couple of other ways. Namely, report generation and warning suppression uniformity. I\'d like to add these aspects to this discussion (which should probably have the \"static-analysis\" tag also): how are folks configuring these tools to create a \"unified\" solution? (I\'ve asked this question separately <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/79918/configuring-static-analysis-tools-for-uniformity\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<p><p>First, for warning reports, I transform the output so that each warning has the simple format:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/absolute-path/filename:line-number:column-number: warning(tool-name): message</code></pre>\n\n<p><p>This is often called the \"Emacs format,\" but even if you aren\'t using Emacs, it\'s a reasonable format for homogenizing reports. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/project/src/com/example/Foo.java:425:9: warning(Checkstyle):Missing a Javadoc comment.</code></pre>\n\n<p><p>My warning format transformations are done by my Ant script with Ant <a href=\"http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/filterchain.html\">filterchains</a>.</p>\n\n<p><p>The second \"integration\" that I do is for warning suppression. By default, each tool supports comments or an annotation (or both) that you can place in your code to silence a warning that you want to ignore. But these various warning suppression requests do not have a consistent look which seems somewhat silly. When you\'re suppressing a warning, you\'re suppressing a warning, so why not always write \"<code>SuppressWarning</code>?\"</p>\n\n<p><p>For example, PMD\'s default configuration suppresses warning generation on lines of code with the string \"<code>NOPMD</code>\" in a comment. Also, PMD supports Java\'s <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation. I configure PMD to use comments containing \"<code>SuppressWarning(PMD.</code>\" instead of <code>NOPMD</code> so that PMD suppressions look alike. I fill in the particular rule that is violated when using the comment style suppression:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// SuppressWarnings(PMD.PreserveStackTrace) justification: (false positive) exceptions are chained</code></pre>\n\n<p><p>Only the \"<code>SuppressWarnings(PMD.</code>\" part is significant for a comment, but it is consistent with PMD\'s support for the <code>@SuppressWarning</code> annotation which does recognize individual rule violations by name:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@SuppressWarnings(\"PMD.CompareObjectsWithEquals\") // justification: identity comparision intended</code></pre>\n\n<p><p>Similarly, Checkstyle suppresses warning generation between pairs of comments (no annotation support is provided). By default, comments to turn Checkstyle off and on contain the strings <code>CHECKSTYLE:OFF</code> and <code>CHECKSTYLE:ON</code>, respectively. Changing this configuration (with Checkstyle\'s \"SuppressionCommentFilter\") to use the strings \"<code>BEGIN&nbsp;SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.</code>\" and \"<code>END&nbsp;SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.</code>\" makes the controls look more like PMD:</p>\n\n<pre>\n<code>// BEGIN SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField) justification: \"Effective Java,\" 2nd ed., Bloch, Item 2</code>\n<code>// END SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField)</code>\n</pre>\n\n<p><p>With Checkstyle comments, the particular check violation (<code>HiddenField</code>) <em>is</em> significant because each check has its own \"<code>BEGIN/END</code>\" comment pair.</p>\n\n<p><p>FindBugs also supports warning generation suppression with a <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation, so no further configuration is required to achieve some level of uniformity with other tools. Unfortunately, Findbugs has to support a custom <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation because the built-in Java <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation has a <code>SOURCE</code> retention policy which is not strong enough to retain the annotation in the class file where FindBugs needs it. I fully qualify FindBugs warnings suppressions to avoid clashing with Java\'s <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressWarnings(\"UWF&#95;FIELD&#95;NOT&#95;INITIALIZED&#95;IN&#95;CONSTRUCTOR\")</code></pre>\n\n<p><p>These techniques makes things look reasonably consistent across tools. Note that having each warning suppression contain the string \"<code>SuppressWarnings</code>\" makes it easy to run a simple search to find all instances for all tools over an entire code base.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(80009,'A',4080,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-09-17 04:31:00',NULL,'E','','<p>I\'ve had good luck with Cobertura.

I suggest the incendiary article by Allen Holub \"<a href=\"http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-09-2003/jw-0905-toolbox.html\">Getters And Setters Are Evil</a>\". Granted, the title is for shock value, but the author makes valid points.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, if you have getters and setters for each and every private field, you are making those fields as good as public. You\'d be very hard-pressed to change the type of a private field without ripple effects to every class that calls that getter.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, from a strictly OO point of view, objects should be responding to messages (methods) that correspond to their (hopefully) single responsibility. The vast majority of getters and setters don\'t make sense for their constituent objects; Pen.dispenseInkOnto(Surface) makes more sense to me than Pen.getColor().</p>\n\n<p>Getters and setters also encourage users of the class to ask the object for some data, perform a calculation, and then set some other value in the object, better known as procedural programming. You\'d be better served to simply tell the object to do what you were going to in the first place; also known as the <a href=\"http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~gpollice/cs4233-a05/CourseNotes/maps/class4/InformationExpert.html\">Information Expert</a> idiom.</p>\n\n<p>Getters and setters, however, are necessary evils at the boundary of layers -- UI, persistence, and so forth. Restricted access to a class\'s internals, such as C++\'s friend keyword, Java\'s package protected access, .NET\'s internal access, and the <a href=\"http://moffdub.wordpress.com/2008/09/17/friend-classes-in-java-and-c-sharp/\">Friend Class Pattern</a> can help you reduce the visibility of getters and setters to only those who need them.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(99003,'A',54886,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-09-19 02:34:00','2011-04-11 02:27:00','E','','<p>When debugging I find the \"Display\" view really useful.

Because most types of data can be represented as XML, XQuery can also be used to query other types of data. For example, XQuery can be used to query relational data using an XML view of a relational database. This is important because many Internet applications need to integrate information from multiple sources, including data found in web messages, relational data, and various XML sources. XQuery was specifically designed for this kind of data integration.</p>\n\n<p>For example, suppose your company is a financial institution that needs to produce reports of stock holdings for each client. A client requests a report with a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) message, which is represented in XML. In most businesses, the stock holdings data is stored in multiple relational databases, such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, or DB2. XQuery can query both the SOAP message and the relational databases, creating a report in XML.</p>\n\n<p>XQuery is based on the structure of XML and leverages that structure to make it possible to perform queries on any type of data that can be represented as XML, including relational data.

In tracing the GC starts from the \"roots\" - things like stack references, and traces all reachable (live) objects. Anything that can\'t be reached is considered dead. In reference counting each time a reference is modified the object\'s involved have their count updated. Any object whose reference count gets set to zero is considered dead.</p>\n\n<p>With basically all GC implementations there are trade offs but tracing is usually good for high through put (i.e. fast) operation but has longer pause times (larger gaps where the UI or program may freeze up). Reference counting can operate in smaller chunks but will be slower overall. It may mean less freezes but poorer performance overall.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally a reference counting GC requires a cycle detector to clean up any objects in a cycle that won\'t be caught by their reference count alone.

I got downvoted for mentioning the fact that strings are immutable types.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of why Format() would be dumb as an instance method. In .NET (and probably in Java), Replace() is an instance method.</p>\n\n<p>You can do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code> \"I Like Wine\".Replace(\"Wine\",\"Beer\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, nothing happens, because Strings are immutable. Replace tries to return a new string, but it is assigned to nothing.</p>\n\n<p>This causes lots of common rookie mistakes like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Contrived Example\ninputText.Replace(\" \",\"%20\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, nothing happens, instead you have to do :</p>\n\n<pre><code>inputText = inputText.Replace(\" \",\"%20\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, if you understand that strings are immutable, that makes perfect sense. If you don\'t, then you are just confused. The proper place for Replace, would be where Format is, as a static method of String:</p>\n\n<pre><code> inputText = String.Replace(inputText,\" \", \"%20\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now there is no question as to whats going on.</p>\n\n<p>The real question is, why did the authors of these frameworks decide that one should be an instance method, and the other static? In my opinion, both are more elegantly expressed as static methods, but erickson seems to think both belong as instance methods.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of your opinion, the truth is that you are less prone to make a mistake using the static version, and the code is easier to understand (No Hidden Gotchas).</p>\n\n<p>Of course there are some methods that are perfect as instance methods, take String.Length()</p>\n\n<pre><code>int length = \"123\".Length();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this situation, its obvious we are not trying to modify \"123\", we just inspecting it, and returning its length...This is a perfect candidate for an instance method.</p>\n\n<p>My simple rules for Instance Methods on Immutable Objects:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you need to return a new instance of the same type, use a static method.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, use an instance method.</li>\n</ul>\n','',NULL,'@'),(198614,'A',18538,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-10-13 18:48:00',NULL,'E','','<p>Check out \"inject\".

Exceptions</strong> <em>Item 42: Favor the use of standard exceptions</em>. Here\'s a bit of what he says,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Reusing preexisting exceptions has several benefits. Chief among these, it makes your API easier to learn and use because <strong>it matches established conventions with which programmers are already familiar</strong> [<em>my emphasis, not Bloch\'s</em>]. A close second is that programs using your API are easier to read because they aren\'t cluttered with unfamiliar exceptions. Finally, fewer exception classes mean a smaller memory footprint and less time spent loading classes.</p>\n  \n  <p>The most commonly reused exception is IllegalArgumentException. This is generally the exception to throw when the caller passes in an argument whose value is inappropriate. For example, this would be the exception to throw if the caller passed a negative number in a parameter representing the number of times some action were to be repeated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That said, you should <strong>never</strong> throw Exception itself. Java has a well-chosen, diverse and well-targeted bunch of built-in exceptions that cover most situations <strong>AND</strong> describe the exception that occurred well enough so that you can remedy the cause.</p>\n\n<p>Be friendly to the programmers who have to maintain your code in the future.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(219325,'A',34144,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-10-20 18:02:00',NULL,'E','','<p>The dependency information is also included in the Project Information/Dependencies report if you have maven generate a site for the project, using mvn site.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(219555,'A',64392,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-10-20 19:22:00',NULL,'E','','<p><a href=\"http://www.javagaming.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.javagaming.org/</a> is a good source for up-to-date information.</p>\n\n<p>Another framework not mentioned yet is <a href=\"http://xith.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xith3D</a></p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(221413,'A',27532,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-10-21 10:36:00',NULL,'E','','<p>I\'ve been using <a href=\"http://blog.logeek.fr/2008/10/21/generating-gradients-for-your-css-using-rmagick\" rel=\"nofollow\">RMagick for that</a>.

A more sophisticated approach would be a biometric scanner, but that would require government records of thumb/finger prints or retinal scan - I can already see the privacy advocates lining up at the lawyer\'s offices.</p>\n\n<p>Another approach would be for the voter \"registrar office\" to issue digital keys to each voter prior to the election - a (relatively) short (cryptographically strong) random alpha/numeric key that is entered with the voter\'s name and/or SSN into the application. Knowledge of that key is required for that particular voter in that particular election.  These keys would be issued by post in tamper-evident envelopes, like those used by banks for postal confirmation of wire transfers and delivery of PIN numbers.

If you didn\'t think this was unreasonably complicated already!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lazy loaded objects are subclasses</strong></p>\n\n<p>If your objects are persisted using an ORM, in many cases you will be dealing with dynamic proxies to avoid loading object too early from the data store. These proxies are implemented as subclasses of your own class. This means that<code>this.getClass() == o.getClass()</code> will return false. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Person saved = new Person(\"John Doe\");\nLong key = dao.save(saved);\ndao.flush();\nPerson retrieved = dao.retrieve(key);\nsaved.getClass().equals(retrieved.getClass()); // Will return false if Person is loaded lazy\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>If you\'re dealing with an ORM using <code>o instanceof Person</code> is the only thing that will behave correctly.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Lazy loaded objects have null-fields</strong></p>\n\n<p>ORMs usually use the getters to force loading of lazy loaded objects. This means that <code>person.name</code> will be null if <code>person</code> is lazy loaded, even if <code>person.getName()</code> forces loading and returns \"John Doe\". In my experience, this crops up more often in <code>hashCode</code> and <code>equals</code>.</p>\n\n<p><em>If you\'re dealing with an ORM, make sure to always use getters, and never field references in <code>hashCode</code> and <code>equals</code>.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Saving an object will change it\'s state</strong></p>\n\n<p>Persistent objects often use a <code>id</code> field to hold the key of the object. This field will be automatically updated when an object is first saved. Don\'t use an id field in <code>hashCode</code>. But you can use it in <code>equals</code>.</p>\n\n<p>A pattern I often use is</p>\n\n<pre><code>if (this.getId() == null) {\n    return this == other;\n} else {\n    return this.getId() == other.getId();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But: You cannot include <code>getId()</code> in <code>hashCode()</code>. If you do, when an object is persisted, it\'s <code>hashCode</code> changes. If the object is in a <code>HashSet</code>, you\'ll \"never\" find it again.</p>\n\n<p>In my <code>Person</code> example, I probably would use <code>getName()</code> for <code>hashCode</code> and <code>getId</code> plus <code>getName()</code> (just for paranoia) for <code>equals</code>. It\'s okay if there are some risk of \"collisions\" for <code>hashCode</code>, but never okay for <code>equals</code>.</p>\n\n<p><em><code>hashCode</code> should use the non-changing subset of properties from <code>equals</code></em></p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(259287,'A',15496,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-11-03 17:02:00',NULL,'E','','<p>As of Java 1.5, Java now has a much cleaner syntax for writing functions of variable arity.

Most of our hand-written code concerned itself with connecting events to actions, simply asking the layout for the relevant controls.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s a crime that code generation is the default way to layout code in Java because better ways of doing GUIs have been around for decades. I have used Matisse, the NetBeans GUI code generator. While Matisse (now known as \"<a href=\"http://netbeans.org/features/java/swing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Swing GUI Builder</a>\") makes it pleasant to layout components, it is similar to all other code generation tools because when you use Matisse you must live in constant fear that someone else edited the \"you cannot edit this in NetBeans\" GUI sections outside of NetBeans. As soon as you touch the layout builder again it could destroy their work and then you have a broken GUI. There might be some simple task like re-ordering a variable initialization and its use or re-naming a variable (this was especially a problem when using Matisse\'s database feature). You know how to do this by editing the un-editable source code but may waste time trying to figure out how to do the same thing in the GUI builder.

CALLBACK_SERVER_SOCKET_FACTORY : SERVER_SOCKET_FACTORY));\n}\n// ....\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, the first argument specifies the part on which the object is expecting requests, whereas the second and third specify the socket factories that will be used at either end of the connection driving this remote object.</p>\n\n<p>Since we wanted to restrict the ports used by the connection, we needed to extend the RMI socket factories and lock down the ports.  Here are some sketches of our server and client factories:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class SpecifiedServerSocketFactory implements RMIServerSocketFactory {\n/** Always use this port when specified. */\nprivate int serverPort;\n/**\n * @param ignoredPort This port is ignored.  \n * @return a {@link ServerSocket} if we managed to create one on the correct port.\n * @throws java.io.IOException\n */\n@Override\npublic ServerSocket createServerSocket(final int ignoredPort) throws IOException {\n    try {\n        final ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(this.serverPort);\n        return serverSocket;\n    } catch (IOException ioe) {\n        throw new IOException(\"Failed to open server socket on port \" + serverPort, ioe);\n    }\n}\n// ....\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that the server socket factory above ensures that only the port that you previously specified will ever be used by this factory.  The client socket factory has to be paired with the appropriate socket factory (or you\'ll never connect).</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class SpecifiedClientSocketFactory implements RMIClientSocketFactory, Serializable {\n/** Serialization hint */\npublic static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\n/** This is the remote port to which we will always connect. */\nprivate int remotePort;\n/** Storing the host just for reference. */\nprivate String remoteHost = \"HOST NOT YET SET\";\n// ....\n/**\n * @param host The host to which we are trying to connect\n * @param ignoredPort This port is ignored.  \n * @return A new Socket if we managed to create one to the host.\n * @throws java.io.IOException\n */\n@Override\npublic Socket createSocket(final String host, final int ignoredPort) throws IOException {\n    try {\n        final Socket socket = new Socket(host, remotePort);\n        this.remoteHost = host;\n        return socket;\n    } catch (IOException ioe) {\n        throw new IOException(\"Failed to open a socket back to host \" + host + \" on port \" + remotePort, ioe);\n    }\n}\n// ....\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, the only thing remaining to force your two way connection to stay on the same set of ports is some logic to recognize that you are calling back to the client-side.  In that situation, just make sure that your factory method for the remote object calls the RemoteObjectWrapper constructor up top with the callback parameter set to true.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(304204,'A',29516,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-11-20 02:53:00',NULL,'E','','<p>I have not investigated using it with Spring yet, but I would not use any template engine but StringTemplate (see <a href=\"http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~parrt/papers/mvc.templates.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~parrt/papers/mvc.templates.pdf</a> for why).</p>\n\n<p>If you are set on Spring, then I would figure out how to integrate it with StringTemplate, although I suspect that it has already been done before.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(305214,'A',6816,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-11-20 12:58:00',NULL,'E','','<p>Got this error to the other day.

What matter most, in my opinion, is whether the caller is interested in catching the exception or not.</p>\n\n<p>If you write a library to be used elsewhere, or a lower-level layer in your application, ask yourself if the caller is interested in catching (knowing about) your exception.

Spring and hibernate, in particularly, come to mind - they convert known checked exception to unchecked exception precisely because checked exceptions are overused in Java. One example that I can think of is the JSONException from json.org, which is a checked exception and is mostly annoying - it should be unchecked, but the developer simply haven\'t thought it through.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, most of the time the caller\'s interest in the exception is directly correlated to the ability to recover from the exception, but that is not always the case.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(322889,'A',27578,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2008-11-27 03:44:00','2008-11-27 03:49:00','E','','<p>You\'re correct. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Unchecked exceptions</strong> are used to let the system <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast\">fail fast</a> which is a good thing. You should clearly state what is your method expecting in order to work properly.  This way you can validate the input only once.</p>\n\n<p>For instance:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/**\n * @params operation - The operation to execute.\n * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the operation is \"exit\"\n */\n public final void execute( String operation ) {\n     if( \"exit\".equals(operation)){\n          throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"I told you not to...\");\n     }\n     this.operation = operation; \n     .....  \n }\n private void secretCode(){\n      // we perform the operation.\n      // at this point the opreation was validated already.\n      // so we don\'t worry that operation is \"exit\"\n      .....  \n }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Just to put an example. The point is, if the system fails fast, then you\'ll know where and why it did fail.  You\'ll get an stacktrace like:</p>\n\n<pre><code> IllegalArgumentException: I told you not to use \"exit\" \n at some.package.AClass.execute(Aclass.java:5)\n at otherPackage.Otherlass.delegateTheWork(OtherClass.java:4569)\n ar ......\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And you\'ll know what happened. The OtherClass in the \"delegateTheWork\" method ( at line 4569 ) called your class with the \"exit\" value, even when it shouldn\'t  etc.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise you would have to sprinkle validations all over your code and that\'s error prone. Plus, sometimes it is hard to track what went wrong and you may expect hours of frustrating  debugging </p>\n\n<p>Same thing happens with NullPointerExceptions. If you have a 700 lines class with some 15 methods, that uses 30 attributes and none of them can be null, instead of validating in each of those methods for nullability you could make all those attributes read-only and validate them in the constructor or factory method.</p>\n\n<pre><code> public static MyClass createInstane( Object data1, Object data2 /* etc */ ){ \n      if( data1 == null ){ throw NullPointerException( \"data1 cannot be null\"); }\n\n  }\n\n\n  // the rest of the methods don\'t validate data1 anymore.\n  public void method1(){ // don\'t worry, nothing is null \n      ....\n  }\n  public void method2(){ // don\'t worry, nothing is null \n      ....\n  }\n  public void method3(){ // don\'t worry, nothing is null \n      ....\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Checked exceptions</strong> Are useful when the programmer ( you or your co-workers ) did everything right, validated the input, ran tests, and all the code is perfect, but the code connects to a third party webservice that may be down ( or a file you were using  was deleted by another external process etc ) . The webservice may even be validate before the connection is attempted, but during the data transfer something went wrong.</p>\n\n<p>In that scenario there is nothing that you or your co-workers can do to help it. But still you have to do something and not let the application just die and disappear in the eyes of the user.  You use a checked exception for that and handle the exception, what can you do when that happens?, most of the time , just to attempt to log the error, probably save your work ( the app work ) and present a message to the user. ( The site blabla is down, please retry later etc. ) </p>\n\n<p>If the checked exception are overused ( by  adding the \"throw Exception\" in the all the methods signatures ) , then your code will become very fragile, because everyone will ignore that exception ( because is too general ) and the quality of code will be seriously compromised.</p>\n\n<p>If you overuse unchecked exception something similar will happen.

I have some experience with Eclipse (~4 months developing RCP) and now Netbeans (played around for a couple of days). IMHO these frameworks are too complicated. You just end up debugging into Eclipse-specific plugin loaders trying to figure out why you get a ClassNotFoundException or a NullPointer. The same story with NetBeans: somehow somewhere somewhat reads out xml config files and creates UI from that, cool, as long as you follow the tutorial. And of course you can\'t develop and Eclipse-based RCP using some other IDE, NB is also very jealous about its usage (unless you do some hacks like I did).\nWhat I\'m lacking is a clear way to debug my threads from main to action performed. Instead I\'m always told what I have to do to avoid exceptions. And so I have to keep my fingers crossed each time I\'m trying to pull something new. And it never works out the first time.\nNow I thought about the features I need and I looked out for smaller projects that aim at specific functionality like plugin management eg. And there are plenty. Just compile a list of the functionality you need and start adding smaller frameworks by integrating them into your project.

Although this depends on your task, Java has much more open source or third party libraries available there.

Two issue: first, platform compatibility. Java still wins since JDK is well maintained by single and original company Sun.

Lets face it: If you want to reach 100.000+ players, you\'re ending up building your own technology stack, at least for the critical core. That\'s what CCP did for EVE Online (<a href=\"http://myeve.eve-online.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=584\">StacklessIO</a>), that\'s what Blizzard did for World of Warcraft (although they do use many third-party libraries), that\'s what Mythic did for Warhammer Online (although they are based on Gamebryo).</p>\n\n<p>However, if you aim to be a small, niche MMO (like the dozens of Free-to-Play/Itemshop MMOs), then getting the Network stuff right is just insanely hard, data consistency is even harder and scalability is the biggest b*tch.</p>\n\n<p>But game technology is not your only problem - you also need to tackle Billing. Credit Card only? Have fun selling in Germany then, people there want ELV. That\'s where you need a reliable billing provider, but you still need to wire in the billing application with your accounts to make sure that accounts are blocked/reactivated when the billing fails.</p>\n\n<p>There are some companies already offering \"MMO Infratructure Services\" (i.e. <a href=\"http://www.e-eis.com/cms/front_content.php?changelang=2\">Arvato\'s EEIS</a>), but the bottom line is: Stuff like Project Darkstar IS realistic, but assuming that you can build a Multi-Billion-MMO entirely on a Third Party Stack is optimistic, possibly idealistic.</p>\n\n<p>But then again, entirely inventing all of the technology is even more stupid - use the Third Party stuff that you need (i.e. Billing, Font Rendering, Audio Output...), but <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001172.html\">write the stuff that really makes or breaks your business</a> (i.e. Network stack, User interface etc.) on your own. (Note: Jeff\'s posting may be <a href=\"http://damilare.net/random-talks/dare-obasanjo-vs-jeff-atwood-on-html-validation/\">a bit flawed</a>, but the overall direction is correct IMHO.)</p>\n\n<p>Addendum: Also, the game industry does license and reuse engines a lot. The most prominent game Engines are the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine\">Unreal Engine</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Engine\">Source Engine</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_tech\">id Tech</a>, which fuel dozens, if not hundreds of games. But there are some lesser-known (outside of the industry) engines. There is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebryo\">Gamebryo</a>, the Middleware behind games like Civilization 4 and Fallout 3, there was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RenderWare\">RenderWare</a> that is now only EA-in-House, but used in games like Battlefield 2 or The Sims 3. There is the open source <a href=\"http://www.ogre3d.org/\">Ogre3d</a>, which was used in <a href=\"http://www.dtp-entertainment.com/en/games/game_detail.php?id=2973&amp;landid=1\">some</a> commercial <a href=\"http://www.venetica-game.com/\">titles</a>.

In Java they are basically syntactic sugar to minimize boilerplate casting of Objects.  Here is a pretty decent <a href=\"http://www.mindview.net/WebLog/log-0061\">introduction to C++ templates vs Java generics</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To elaborate on this point: when you use a C++ template, you\'re basically creating another copy of the code, just as if you used a <code>#define</code> macro.  This allows you to do things like have <code>int</code> parameters in template definitions that determine sizes of arrays and such.</p>\n\n<p>Java doesn\'t work like that.  In Java all objects extent from <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html\">java.lang.Object</a> so, pre-Generics, you\'d write code like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class PhoneNumbers {\n  private Map phoneNumbers = new HashMap();\n\n  public String getPhoneNumber(String name) {\n    return (String)phoneNumbers.get(name);\n  }\n\n  ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>because all the Java collection types used Object as their base type so you could put anything in them.  Java 5 rolls around and adds generics so you can do things like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class PhoneNumbers {\n  private Map&lt;String, String&gt; phoneNumbers = new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;();\n\n  public String getPhoneNumber(String name) {\n    return phoneNumbers.get(name);\n  }\n\n  ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And that\'s all Java Generics are: wrappers for casting objects.  That\'s because Java Generics aren\'t reified.  They use type erasure.  This decision was made because Java Generics came along so late in the piece that they didn\'t want to break backward compatibility (a <code>Map&lt;String, String&gt;</code> is usable whenever a <code>Map</code> is called for).  Compare this to .Net/C# where type erasure isn\'t used, which leads to all sorts of differences (eg you can use primitive types and <code>IEnumerable</code> and <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> bear no relation to each other).</p>\n\n<p>And a class using generics compiled with a Java 5+ compiler is usable no JDK 1.4 (assuming it doesn\'t use any ohter features or classes that require Java 5+).</p>\n\n<p>That\'s why Java Generics are called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar\">syntactic sugar</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But this decision on how to do generics has profound effects so much so that the (superb) <a href=\"http://www.angelikalanger.com/GenericsFAQ/JavaGenericsFAQ.html\">Java Generics FAQ</a> has sprung up to answer the many, many questions people have about Java Generics.</p>\n\n<p>C++ templates have a number of features that Java Generics don\'t:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use of primitive type arguments.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>template&lt;class T, int i&gt;\nclass Matrix {\n  int T[i][i];\n  ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use of <a href=\"http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc/language/ref/default_args_for_templ_params.htm\">default type arguments</a>, which is one feature I miss in Java but there are backwards compatibility reasons for this;</li>\n<li>C++ allows the use of primitive type arguments, Java doesn\'t; and</li>\n<li>Java allows bounding of arguments.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ObservableList&lt;T extends List&gt; {\n  ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It really does need to be stressed that template invocations with different arguments really are different types.  They don\'t even share static members.  In Java this is not the case.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from the differences with generics, for completeness, here is a <a href=\"http://www.javacoffeebreak.com/articles/thinkinginjava/comparingc++andjava.html\">basic comparison of C++ and Java</a> (and <a href=\"http://triton.towson.edu/~mzimand/os/Lect2-java-tutorial.html\">another one</a>).</p>\n\n<p>And I can also suggest <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0131872486\">Thinking in Java</a>.

Especially in large, multi-project situations with many users, those users may tend to be familiar with only one or two of the projects in the repository. But the projects-as-branch-siblings tends to de-emphasize project individuality and focus on the entire set of projects as a single entity. That\'s a social issue though. We like our originally suggested arrangement for purely practical reasons—it\'s easier to ask about (or modify, or migrate elsewhere) the entire history of a single project when there\'s a single repository path that holds the entire history—past, present, tagged, and branched—for that project and that project alone.\"</p>\n\n<p>For my own, I tend to agree quite strongly with this and prefer the following layout:\n/\n   utils/\n      calc/\n         trunk/\n         tags/\n         branches/\n      calendar/\n         trunk/\n         tags/\n         branches/\n      …\n   office/\n      spreadsheet/\n         trunk/\n         tags/\n         branches/</p>\n\n<p>The reason are simply that its impractical to tag a complete project set when one would want to tag only a specific subset.</p>\n\n<p>Let\'s use an example: If project-1 depends on moduleA v1.1 and moduleB v2.3, I don\'t want newer moduleA v2.x to appear in the tags.

Instead you could do something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void getValues(int[] arg1, int[] arg2) {\n    arg1[0] = 1;\n    arg2[0] = 2;\n}\nvoid caller() {\n    int[] x = new int[1];\n    int[] y = new int[1];\n    getValues(x, y);\n    System.out.println(\"Result: \" + x[0] + \" \" + y[0]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As was explained in previous answers, in Java you\'re passing a pointer to the array as a value into <code>getValues</code>. That is enough, because the method then modifies the array element, and by convention you\'re expecting element 0 to contain the return value. Obviously you can do this in other ways, such as structuring your code so this isn\'t necessary, or constructing a class that can contain the return value or allow it to be set.

If you change StringBuffer into String it will produce just Hello because String is immutable.

I feel like I have a pretty firm grasp on what closures are, but I can\'t think of a solid example of how they would make an Object-Oriented language \"better.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, most people who use the term \"closure\" actually mean \"function object\", and in this sense, function objects make it possible to write simpler code in certain circumstances such as when you need custom comparators in a sort function.  </p>\n\n<p>For example, in Python:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def reversecmp(x, y):\n   return y - x\n\na = [4, 2, 5, 9, 11]\na.sort(cmp=reversecmp)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This sorts the list a in reverse order by passing the custom comparison functoin reversecmp.  The addition of the lambda operator makes things even more compact:</p>\n\n<pre><code>a = [4, 2, 5, 9, 11]\na.sort(cmp=lambda x, y : y - x)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Java does not have function objects, so it uses \"functor classes\" to simulate them.  In Java you do the equivalent operation by implementing a custom version of the Comparator class, and passing that to the sort function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class ReverseComparator implements Comparator {\n   public compare(Object x, Object y) {\n      return (Integer) y - (Integer) x;\n   }\n\n...\n\nList&lt;Integer&gt; a = Arrays.asList(4, 2, 5, 9, 11);\nCollections.sort(a, new ReverseComparator());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, it gives the same effect as closures, but is clumsier and more verbose.  However, the addition of anonymous inner classes obviates most of the pain:</p>\n\n<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; a = Arrays.asList(4, 2, 5, 9, 11);\nComparator reverse = new Comparator() {\n   public Compare(Object x, Object y) {\n       return (Integer) y - (Integer) x;\n   }\n}\nCollections.sort(a, reverse);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So I would say that the combination of functor classes + anonymous inner classes in Java is sufficient to compensate for the lack of true function objects, making their addition unnecessary.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(716763,'A',50255,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2009-04-04 08:23:00',NULL,'E','','<p>As a Lisp programmer I would wish that the Java community understands the following difference: <strong>functions as objects vs. closures</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>a) <strong>functions can be named or anonymous</strong>. But they can also be objects of themselves. This allows functions to be passed around as arguments, returned from functions or stored in data structures. This means that functions are first class objects in a programming language.</p>\n\n<p>Anonymous functions don\'t add much to the language, they just allow you to write functions in a shorter way.</p>\n\n<p>b) <strong>A closure is a function plus a binding environment</strong>. closures can be passed <em>downwards</em> (as parameters) or returned <em>upwards</em> (as return values). This allows the function to refer to variables of its environment, even if the surrounding code is no longer active.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a) in some language, then the question comes up what to do about b)? There are languages that have a), but not b). In the functional programming world a (functions) and b (functions as closures) is nowadays the norm. Smalltalk had a) (<em>blocks</em> are anonymous functions) for a long time, but then some dialects of Smalltalk added support for b) (blocks as closures).</p>\n\n<p>You can imagine that you get a slightly different programming model if you add functions and closures to the language. </p>\n\n<p>From a pragmatic view the anonymous function adds some short notation where you pass or invoke functions. That can be a good thing.</p>\n\n<p>The closure (function plus binding) allows you for example to create a function that has access to some variables (for example to a counter value). Now you can store that function in an object, access it and invoke it. The context for the function object is now not only the objects it has access to, but also the variables it has access to via bindings. This is also useful, but you can see that variable bindings vs. access to object variables now is an issue: when should be something a <em>lexical</em> variable (that can be accessed in a closure) and when should it be a variable of some object (a <code>slot</code>). When should something be a closure or an object? You can use both in the similar ways. A usual programming exercise for students learning Scheme (a Lisp dialect) is to write a simple object system using closures.</p>\n\n<p>The result is a more complicated programming language and a more complicated runtime model.

What you <em>should</em> be testing is the public contract that the class has with other objects; you should never directly test an object\'s internals.

LATEST refers to the latest released or snapshot version of a particular artifact, the most recently deployed artifact in a particular repository. RELEASE refers to the last non-snapshot release in the repository. In general, it is not a best practice to design software which depends on a non-specific version of an artifact. If you are developing software, you might want to use RELEASE or LATEST as a convenience so that you don\'t have to update version numbers when a new release of a third-party library is released. When you release software, you should always make sure that your project depends on specific versions to reduce the chances of your build or your project being affected by a software release not under your control. Use LATEST and RELEASE with caution, if at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See the <a href=\"http://www.sonatype.com/books/maven-book/reference/pom-relationships-sect-pom-syntax.html#pom-relationships-sect-latest-release\">POM Syntax section of the Maven book</a> for more details.</p>\n\n<p>Here\'s an example illustrating the various options. In the Maven repository, com.foo:my-foo has the following metadata:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;&lt;metadata&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;com.foo&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;my-foo&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;2.0.0&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;versioning&gt;\n    &lt;release&gt;1.1.1&lt;/release&gt;\n    &lt;versions&gt;\n      &lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;\n      &lt;version&gt;1.0.1&lt;/version&gt;\n      &lt;version&gt;1.1&lt;/version&gt;\n      &lt;version&gt;1.1.1&lt;/version&gt;\n      &lt;version&gt;2.0.0&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;/versions&gt;\n    &lt;lastUpdated&gt;20090722140000&lt;/lastUpdated&gt;\n  &lt;/versioning&gt;\n&lt;/metadata&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If a dependency on that artifact is required, you have the following options (other <a href=\"http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVEN/Dependency+Mediation+and+Conflict+Resolution#DependencyMediationandConflictResolution-DependencyVersionRanges\">version ranges</a> can be specified of course, just showing the relevant ones here):</p>\n\n<p>Declare an exact version (will always resolve to 1.0.1):</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;version&gt;[1.0.1]&lt;/version&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Declare an explicit version (will always resolve to 1.0.1 unless a collision occurs, when Maven will select a matching version):</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;version&gt;1.0.1&lt;/version&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Declare a version range for all 1.x (will currently resolve to 1.1.1):</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;version&gt;[1.0.0,2.0.0)&lt;/version&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Declare an open-ended version range (will resolve to 2.0.0):</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;version&gt;[1.0.0,)&lt;/version&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Declare the version as LATEST (will resolve to 2.0.0):</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;version&gt;LATEST&lt;/version&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Declare the version as RELEASE (will resolve to 1.1.1):</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;version&gt;RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that by default your own deployments will update the \"latest\" entry in the Maven metadata, but to update the \"release\" entry, you need to activate the \"release-profile\" from the <a href=\"http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html\">Maven super POM</a>.

For example, if\nyou use a corporate root POM, this\ngoal can be helpful if you need to\nensure you are using the latest\nversion of the corporate root POM.</li>\n<li><strong>versions:update-properties</strong> updates properties defined in a\nproject so that they correspond to\nthe latest available version of\nspecific dependencies. This can be\nuseful if a suite of dependencies\nmust all be locked to one version.</li>\n<li><strong>versions:update-child-modules</strong> updates the parent section of the\nchild modules of a project so the\nversion matches the version of the\ncurrent project. For example, if you\nhave an aggregator pom that is also\nthe parent for the projects that it\naggregates and the children and\nparent versions get out of sync, this\nmojo can help fix the versions of the\nchild modules. (Note you may need to\ninvoke Maven with the -N option in\norder to run this goal if your\nproject is broken so badly that it\ncannot build because of the version\nmis-match).</li>\n<li><strong>versions:lock-snapshots</strong> searches the pom for all -SNAPSHOT\nversions and replaces them with the\ncurrent timestamp version of that\n-SNAPSHOT, e.g. -20090327.172306-4</li>\n<li><strong>versions:unlock-snapshots</strong> searches the pom for all timestamp\nlocked snapshot versions and replaces\nthem with -SNAPSHOT.</li>\n<li><strong>versions:resolve-ranges</strong> finds dependencies using version ranges and\nresolves the range to the specific\nversion being used.</li>\n<li><strong>versions:use-releases</strong> searches the pom for all -SNAPSHOT versions\nwhich have been released and replaces\nthem with the corresponding release\nversion.</li>\n<li><strong>versions:use-next-releases</strong> searches the pom for all non-SNAPSHOT\nversions which have been a newer\nrelease and replaces them with the\nnext release version.</li>\n<li><strong>versions:use-latest-releases</strong> searches the pom for all non-SNAPSHOT\nversions which have been a newer\nrelease and replaces them with the\nlatest release version.</li>\n<li><strong>versions:use-next-versions</strong> searches the pom for all versions\nwhich have been a newer version and\nreplaces them with the next version.</li>\n<li><strong>versions:use-latest-versions</strong> searches the pom for all versions\nwhich have been a newer version and\nreplaces them with the latest\nversion.</li>\n<li><strong>versions:commit</strong> removes the pom.xml.versionsBackup files.

For example, if I\'m validating data entered by a user, if I get value that is unacceptable, the source of that error is with the end user of the application. If I get a null, that\'s programmer error.</li>\n<li>Invalid values can cause things like stack overflows, out of memory errors, parsing exceptions, etc. Indeed, most errors generally present, at some point, as an invalid value in some method call.

That, plus the JDK\'s failure to populate NPE\'s with a message string really has created a strong negative sentiment that isn\'t well founded.

Unfortunately, I don\'t use this at work, more for side projects and personal projects.  For me, it saves me a lot of time developing new projects for clients.  And, one big reason I use it primarily is, the tight integration with each layer and I never get any lazy load errors that I used to get with Spring (even after the filter and other hacks).</p>\n\n<p>An equivalent Spring application would have much more boilerplate code within it to get stuff working.  Spring does not integrate each layer very well, it more or less is a wrapper for a lot of different things, but doesn\'t glue itself together very well.</p>\n\n<p>The other nice thing I like with Seam is they practice what they preach.  Take a look at their website.  Take a guess what it is running, hmm, a live example of their code.  Seam Wiki, Seam Forums, etc.  If you truly believe in your code, stand behind it.  I would be happy to have their pager 24x7x365, I bet it rarely goes off.</p>\n\n<p>While you write a lot less code, the learning curve is about twice as steep.  The further I get in, the more I understand how to write good code.  I would like to see more comments, but as far as coding style, it is well written.</p>\n\n<p>On the negative side, just as any product you try to market, Seam was years after Spring had already become popular so Spring is by far still more popular.  Search on Indeed and Seam only has a few hits.  If you look on Spring, there are roughly 40k registered users, while Seam has about 7k.</p>\n\n<p>Depends on what is important to you, as a Java developer/engineer/programmer, you should be able to work with both technologies and chances are, you will most likely encounter a Spring application before a Seam one.  Learn both and how to leverage both.  If you use both properly and know the nuances and quirks of each, development becomes much easier whether you\'re using Spring or Seam.</p>\n\n<p>I don\'t agree with the statement, \"Seam is the next Struts\".  Struts was a view technology whereas Seam integrates all layers.  I will agree that it is a new concept like Struts and will bring the same impact to the Java community that Struts did.  I don\'t think we\'ll see that until Java EE 6 and CDI become more popular, and of course Seam 3 is released.</p>\n\n<p>Walter</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(2010374,'A',44224,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2010-01-06 01:17:00',NULL,'E','','<p>Your question is very simple so I have listed a few simple steps to start developing a Java application using Oracle technologies.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Install Oracle XE Database.</li>\n<li>Install [JDeveloper].

Then just receive the message in the Servlet doGet/doPost method. Consider low timeout value for receiving in that case.

It just seems to open such a large can of worms for almost no benefit.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(3186336,'A',37026,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2010-07-06 12:58:00','2011-02-17 03:45:00','E','','<p>Clearly, <code>notify</code> wakes (any) one thread in the wait set, <code>notifyAll</code> wakes all threads in the waiting set. The following discussion should clear up any doubts. <code>notifyAll</code> should be used most of the time. If you are not sure which to use, then use <code>notifyAll</code>.Please see explanation that follows.</p>\n\n<p>Read very carefully and understand. Please send me an email if you have any questions.</p>\n\n<p>Look at producer/consumer (assumption is a ProducerConsumer class with two methods). IT IS BROKEN (because it uses <code>notify</code>) - yes it MAY work - even most of the time, but it may also cause deadlock - we will see why:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public synchronized void put(Object o) {\n    while (buf.size()==MAX_SIZE) {\n        wait(); // called if the buffer is full (try/catch removed for brevity)\n    }\n    buf.add(o);\n    notify(); // called in case there are any getters or putters waiting\n}\n\npublic synchronized Object get() {\n    // Y: this is where C2 tries to acquire the lock (i.e. at the beginning of the method)\n    while (buf.size()==0) {\n        wait(); // called if the buffer is empty (try/catch removed for brevity)\n        // X: this is where C1 tries to re-acquire the lock (see below)\n    }\n    Object o = buf.remove(0);\n    notify(); // called if there are any getters or putters waiting\n    return o;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>FIRSTLY,</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why do we need a while loop surrounding the wait?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We need a <code>while</code> loop in case we get this situation:</p>\n\n<p>Consumer 1 (C1) enter the synchronized block and the buffer is empty, so C1 is put in the wait set (via the <code>wait</code> call). Consumer 2 (C2) is about to enter the synchronized method (at point Y above), but Producer P1 puts an object in the buffer, and subsequently calls <code>notify</code>. The only waiting thread is C1, so it is woken and now attempts to re-acquire the object lock at point X (above).</p>\n\n<p>Now C1 and C2 are attempting to acquire the synchronization lock. One of them (nondeterministically) is chosen and enters the method, the other is blocked (not waiting - but blocked, trying to acquire the lock on the method). Let\'s say C2 gets the lock first. C1 is still blocking (trying to acquire the lock at X). C2 completes the method and releases the lock. Now, C1 acquires the lock. Guess what, lucky we have a <code>while</code> loop, because, C1 performs the loop check (guard) and is prevented from removing a non-existent element from the buffer (C2 already got it!). If we didn\'t have a <code>while</code>, we would get an <code>IndexArrayOutOfBoundsException</code> as C1 tries to remove the first element from the buffer!</p>\n\n<p>NOW,</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ok, now why do we need notifyAll?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the producer/consumer example above it looks like we can get away with <code>notify</code>. It seems this way, because we can prove that the guards on the <em>wait</em> loops for producer and consumer are mutually exclusive. That is, it looks like we cannot have a thread waiting in the <code>put</code> method as well as the <code>get</code> method, because, for that to be true, then the following would have to be true:</p>\n\n<p><code>buf.size() == 0 AND buf.size() == MAX_SIZE</code> (assume MAX_SIZE is not 0)</p>\n\n<p>HOWEVER, this is not good enough, we NEED to use <code>notifyAll</code>. Let\'s see why ...</p>\n\n<p>Assume we have a buffer of size 1 (to make the example easy to follow). The following steps lead us to deadlock. Note that ANYTIME a thread is woken with notify, it can be non-deterministically selected by the JVM - that is any waiting thread can be woken. Also note that when multiple threads are blocking on entry to a method (i.e. trying to acquire a lock), the order of acquisition can be non-deterministic. Remember also that a thread can only be in one of the methods at any one time - the synchronized methods allow only one thread to be executing (i.e. holding the lock of) any (synchronized) methods in the class. If the following sequence of events occurs - deadlock results:</p>\n\n<p><strong>STEP 1:</strong><BR>\n- P1 puts 1 char into the buffer</p>\n\n<p><strong>STEP 2:</strong><BR>\n- P2 attempts <code>put</code> - checks wait loop - already a char - waits</p>\n\n<p><strong>STEP 3:</strong><BR>\n- P3 attempts <code>put</code> - checks wait loop - already a char - waits</p>\n\n<p><strong>STEP 4:</strong><BR>\n- C1 attempts to get 1 char <BR>\n- C2 attempts to get 1 char - blocks on entry to the <code>get</code> method<BR>\n- C3 attempts to get 1 char - blocks on entry to the <code>get</code> method</p>\n\n<p><strong>STEP 5:</strong><BR>\n- C1 is executing the <code>get</code> method - gets the char, calls <code>notify</code>, exits method<BR>\n- The <code>notify</code> wakes up P2<BR>\n- BUT, C2 enters method before P2 can (P2 must reacquire the lock), so P2 blocks on entry to the <code>put</code> method<BR>\n- C2 checks wait loop, no more chars in buffer, so waits<BR>\n- C3 enters method after C2, but before P2, checks wait loop, no more chars in buffer, so waits</p>\n\n<p><strong>STEP 6:</strong><BR>\n- NOW: there is P3, C2, and C3 waiting!<BR>\n- Finally P2 acquires the lock, puts a char in the buffer, calls notify, exits method</p>\n\n<p><strong>STEP 7:</strong><BR>\n- P2\'s notification wakes P3 (remember any thread can be woken)<BR>\n- P3 checks the wait loop condition, there is already a char in the buffer, so waits.<BR>\n- NO MORE THREADS TO CALL NOTIFY and THREE THREADS PERMANENTLY SUSPENDED!</p>\n\n<p>SOLUTION: Replace <code>notify</code> with <code>notifyAll</code> in the producer/consumer code (above).</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(3206363,'A',22816,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2010-07-08 17:37:00',NULL,'E','','<p>I suggest you try <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/jzy3d\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://code.google.com/p/jzy3d</a>, a simple java library for plotting 3d data.

Many eclipse packages that are not compatible with each other resulting in NullPointerExceptions in your error console, build problems etc etc.. Shoot me but I have lost my faith in open source. It does not work at a level you could call \'professional\'.  I feel such is merele logical: in a company you have some pressure from people who will call the helpdesk, law-suits because stuff is bad etc and so some manager(s) will do the best they can to make sure all works together. Of course, software will always have bugs.

Essentially\n  Delegates are objects that encode a method dispatch on a specified\n  object. This document shows how java inner classes provide a more\n  generic solution to such problems.</p>\n  \n  <p>What is a Delegate? Really it is very similar to a pointer to member\n  function as used in C++. But a delegate contains the target object\n  alongwith the method to be invoked. Ideally it would be nice to be\n  able to say:</p>\n  \n  <p>obj.registerHandler(ano.methodOne); </p>\n  \n  <p>..and that the method methodOne would be called on ano when some specific event was received.</p>\n  \n  <p>This is what the Delegate structure achieves.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Java Inner Classes</strong> </p>\n  \n  <p>It has been argued that Java provides this\n  functionality via inner classes and thus does not need the additional\n  Delegate construct.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>obj.registerHandler(new Handler() {\n        public void handleIt(Event ev) {\n            methodOne(ev);\n        }\n      } );\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At first glance this seems correct but at the same time a nuisance.\n  Because for many event processing examples the simplicity of the\n  Delegates syntax is very attractive.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>General Handler</strong> </p>\n  \n  <p>However, if event-based programming is used in a more\n  pervasive manner, say, for example, as a part of a general\n  asynchronous programming environment, there is more at stake.</p>\n  \n  <p>In such a general situation, it is not sufficient to include only the\n  target method and target object instance. In general there may be\n  other parameters required, that are determined within the context when\n  the event handler is registered.</p>\n  \n  <p>In this more general situation, the java approach can provide a very\n  elegant solution, particularly when combined with use of final\n  variables:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>void processState(final T1 p1, final T2 dispatch) { \n  final int a1 = someCalculation();\n\n  m_obj.registerHandler(new Handler() {\n    public void handleIt(Event ev) {\n     dispatch.methodOne(a1, ev, p1);\n    }\n  } );\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>final * final * final</strong> </p>\n  \n  <p>Got your attention?</p>\n  \n  <p>Note that the final variables are accessible from within the anonymous\n  class method definitions. Be sure to study this code carefully to\n  understand the ramifications. This is potentially a very powerful\n  technique. For example, it can be used to good effect when registering\n  handlers in MiniDOM and in more general situations.</p>\n  \n  <p>By contrast, the Delegate construct does not provide a solution for\n  this more general requirement, and as such should be rejected as an\n  idiom on which designs can be based.</p>\n</blockquote>\n','',NULL,'@'),(3970608,'A',46663,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2010-10-19 16:38:00','2013-06-13 21:27:00','E','','<pre><code>//set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;activation.jar;mail.jar\nimport javax.mail.*;\nimport javax.mail.internet.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Mail\n{\n    String  d_email = \"iamdvr@gmail.com\",\n            d_password = \"****\",\n            d_host = \"smtp.gmail.com\",\n            d_port  = \"465\",\n            m_to = \"iamdvr@yahoo.com\",\n            m_subject = \"Testing\",\n            m_text = \"Hey, this is the testing email using smtp.gmail.com.\";\n    public static void main(String[] args)\n    {\n        String[] to={\"XXX@yahoo.com\"};\n        String[] cc={\"XXX@yahoo.com\"};\n        String[] bcc={\"XXX@yahoo.com\"};\n        //This is for google\n        Mail.sendMail(\"venkatesh@dfdf.com\", \"password\", \"smtp.gmail.com\", \n                      \"465\", \"true\", \"true\", \n                      true, \"javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory\", \"false\", \n                      to, cc, bcc, \n                      \"hi baba don\'t send virus mails..\", \n                      \"This is my style...of reply..If u send virus mails..\");\n    }\n\n    public synchronized static boolean sendMail(\n        String userName, String passWord, String host, \n        String port, String starttls, String auth, \n        boolean debug, String socketFactoryClass, String fallback, \n        String[] to, String[] cc, String[] bcc, \n        String subject, String text) \n    {\n        Properties props = new Properties();\n        //Properties props=System.getProperties();\n        props.put(\"mail.smtp.user\", userName);\n        props.put(\"mail.smtp.host\", host);\n        if(!\"\".equals(port))\n            props.put(\"mail.smtp.port\", port);\n        if(!\"\".equals(starttls))\n            props.put(\"mail.smtp.starttls.enable\",starttls);\n        props.put(\"mail.smtp.auth\", auth);\n        if(debug) {\n            props.put(\"mail.smtp.debug\", \"true\");\n        } else {\n            props.put(\"mail.smtp.debug\", \"false\");         \n        }\n        if(!\"\".equals(port))\n            props.put(\"mail.smtp.socketFactory.port\", port);\n        if(!\"\".equals(socketFactoryClass))\n            props.put(\"mail.smtp.socketFactory.class\",socketFactoryClass);\n        if(!\"\".equals(fallback))\n            props.put(\"mail.smtp.socketFactory.fallback\", fallback);\n\n        try\n        {\n            Session session = Session.getDefaultInstance(props, null);\n            session.setDebug(debug);\n            MimeMessage msg = new MimeMessage(session);\n            msg.setText(text);\n            msg.setSubject(subject);\n            msg.setFrom(new InternetAddress(\"p_sambasivarao@sutyam.com\"));\n            for(int i=0;i&lt;to.length;i++) {\n                msg.addRecipient(Message.RecipientType.TO, \n                                 new InternetAddress(to[i]));\n            }\n            for(int i=0;i&lt;cc.length;i++) {\n                msg.addRecipient(Message.RecipientType.CC, \n                                 new InternetAddress(cc[i]));\n            }\n            for(int i=0;i&lt;bcc.length;i++) {\n                msg.addRecipient(Message.RecipientType.BCC, \n                                 new InternetAddress(bcc[i]));\n            }\n            msg.saveChanges();\n            Transport transport = session.getTransport(\"smtp\");\n            transport.connect(host, userName, passWord);\n            transport.sendMessage(msg, msg.getAllRecipients());\n            transport.close();\n            return true;\n        }\n        catch (Exception mex)\n        {\n            mex.printStackTrace();\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n','',NULL,'@'),(3977877,'A',51380,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2010-10-20 12:41:00',NULL,'E','','<p>I came across this problem today.

But if you have handles to the things that block (think e.g. sockets) potentially your code can get into deadlock situation (not trivial at all).</p>\n\n<p>I second the opinion of explicitly closing handles in a predictable orderly matter. Basically code for dealing with resources should follow the pattern:</p>\n\n<p>SomeStream s = null;\n...\ntry{\n   s = openStream();\n   ....\n   s.io();\n   ...\n} finally {\n   if (s != null) {\n       s.close();\n       s = null;\n   }\n}</p>\n\n<p>It gets even more complicated if you write your own classes that work via JNI and open handles. You need to make sure handles are closed (released) and that it will happen only once. Frequently overlooked OS handle in Desktop J2SE is Graphics[2D]. Even BufferedImage.getGrpahics() can potentially return you the handle that points into a video driver (actually holding the resource on GPU). If you won\'t release it yourself and leave it  garbage collector to do the work - you may find strange OutOfMemory and alike situation when you ran out of video card mapped bitmaps but still have plenty of memory. In my experience it happens rather frequently in tight loops working with graphics objects (extracting thumbnails, scaling, sharpening you name it).</p>\n\n<p>Basically GC does not take care of programmers responsibility of correct resource management. It only takes care of memory and nothing else. The Stream.finalize calling close() IMHO would be better implemented throwing exception new RuntimeError(\"garbage collecting the stream that is still open\"). It will save hours and days of debugging and cleaning code after the sloppy amateurs left the ends lose.</p>\n\n<p>Happy coding.</p>\n\n<p>Peace.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(5399370,'A',30281,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2011-03-23 00:00:00',NULL,'E','','<p>I have been using Seam from Seam 1.2 since 2007 in mid-size and large projects, sometimes in small projects no more than 200 users.

First of all, if I have understood correctly, Java already has\nsome basic notion of closures (defined through anonymous classes) but the new feature\nthat is going to be introduced is the support for closures based on anonymous functions.</p>\n\n<p>This extension will definitely make the language more expressive but I am not sure\nif it really fits with the rest of the language.\nJava has been designed as an object-oriented language with no support for functional programming: Will the new semantics be easy to understand? Java 6 does not even have functions, will Java 7 have anonymous functions but no \"normal\" functions?</p>\n\n<p>My impression is that as new programming styles or paradigms like functional\nprogramming become more popular, everyone wants to use them in their\nfavourite OOP language. This is understandable: one wants to continue to use\na language they\'re familiar with while adopting new features. But in this way\na language can become really complex and lose coherence.</p>\n\n<p>So my attitude at the moment is to stick to Java 6 for OOP (I hope Java 6 will still\nbe supported for a while) and, in case I really get interested in doing OOP + FP,\nto take a look at some other language like Scala (Scala was defined to be multi-\nparadigm from the beginning and can be well integrated with Java) rather than switching\nto Java 7.</p>\n\n<p>I think Java owes its success to the fact that it combines a simple language with very\npowerful libraries and tools, and I do not think that new features like closures will\nmake it a better programming language.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(6462053,'A',40480,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2011-06-24 00:13:00',NULL,'E','','<p>In my opinion, \"pass by value\" is a terrible way to singularly describe two similar but different events.

More on <code>finalize</code></p>\n\n<p>finalize() is a means to execute final bit of code just before the object is ready for garbage collection ( when the object has no strong reference to it).</p>\n\n<p>So when should it be used?\nOnly in the present two cases:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>As a safety to make sure that some service is closed down or some\ndesired final change is made. For example InputStream class uses it\nto close down the i/o stream. That is for example you have made an\ninstance of BufferedInputStream. Manually after using it one is\nsuppose to close() it. But because one can forget to do that,\nfinalize() act’s as a safety net to close() the stream. </li>\n<li>While\nusing Native’s. Because garbage collector has no control over native\nobjects, finalize() can be used as a means to reclaim it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Apart from the above two cases never use it. To understand why? we need to understand the functioning and lifecycle of an object.</p>\n\n<p>Introduction: There is a separate daemon thread called as finalizer thread which is responsible for calling finalize() method . Finalization queue is the queu where objects which are ready to be called finalize() method are placed.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>When an Object is created, JVM checks if the object has a finalize() method. If it has then it internally notes that this particular object has finalize() method.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When an object is ready for garbage collection, then the garbage collector thread checks if this particular object has finalize() from table mentioned in (1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>2a)    If it doesn’t then it is sent for garbage collection.</p>\n\n<p>2b) It is has, then it is added to the finalization queue. And it removes the entry of the object from the table (1).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Finalizer thread keeps polling the queue. For every object in the queue, its finalize() method is called. After calling the finalize() cycle from (2) is again repeated. If this object still has no strong reference, then sent for GC. If\n    it has then ALWAYS (2a) is called because the entry was deleted in (2b)</p>\n\n<pre><code>Basically finalize() method is only called once.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So what’s the issue with the above cycle?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From (1). Its take extra time in object creation. Memory allocation in Java is 5x to 10x faster than malloc/calloc etc. All the time gained is lost in the procedure of noting the object in the table etc. I once tried it. Create 100000 objects in a loop and measure the time taken for program to terminate in 2 cases: One with no finalize(), Second with finalize(). Found it to be 20% faster.</p>\n  \n  <p>From (2b): Memory Leakage and Starvation. If the object in the queue has references to a lot of memory resources, then all those objects wont get freed unless this object is ready for GC.If all the objects are heavy weight objects, then there can be a shortage.</p>\n  \n  <p>From (2b): Because finalize() is called only once, what if in teh finalize() you had a strong reference to “this” object. Next time the object’s finalie() is never called hence can leave the object in an inconsistent state.</p>\n  \n  <p>If inside finalize() an exception is thrown, it is ignored.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You do not know when finalize() is called as you have no control over when GC is called. Sometimes it might happen that you are printing the  value’s in finalize() but the output is never shown, because your program might have got terminated by the time finalize() is called.</p>\n\n<p>Hence avoid using it. Instead create a method say dispose() which will close the necessory resources or for final log etc.\n<a href=\"http://jatinpuri.com/?p=106\" rel=\"nofollow\">the complete post on it</a>.

Other than that, it is all subjective.</p>\n\n<p>I share C# code across the following platforms:\n- iOS (iPhone/iPad)\n- Android\n- The Web (HTML5)\n- Mac (OS X)\n- Linux\n- Windows</p>\n\n<p>I could share it even more places:\n- Windows Phone 7\n- Wii\n- XBox\n- PS3\n- etc.</p>\n\n<p>The biggie is iOS since <a href=\"http://xamarin.com/monotouch\">MonoTouch</a> works fantastically. I do not know of any good way to target iOS with Java. You cannot target Windows Phone 7 with Java, so I would say that the days of Java being better for mobile are behind us.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest factor for me though is personal productivity (and happiness). C# as a language is years ahead of Java IMHO and the .NET framework is a joy to use. Most of what is being added in Java 7 and Java 8 has been in C# for years. JVM languages like Scala and Clojure (both available on the CLR) are pretty nice though.</p>\n\n<p>I see Mono as a platform in it\'s own right (a great one) and treat .NET as the Microsoft implementation of Mono on Windows. This means that I develop and test on Mono first. This works wonderfully.</p>\n\n<p>If both Java and .NET (Mono let\'s say) were Open Source projects without any corporate backing, I would choose Mono over Java every time. I believe it is just a better platform.</p>\n\n<p>Both .NET/Mono and the JVM are great choices, although I would personally use some other language than Java on the JVM.</p>\n\n<h1>My take on some of the other comments:</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Issue: Performance.</strong></p>\n\n<p>**Answer: Both the JVM and the CLR perform better than detractors say they do. I would say that the JVM performs better. Mono is generally slower than .NET (though not always).</p>\n\n<p>I personally would take ASP.NET MVC over J2EE any day both as a developer and an end-user. Support for <a href=\"http://www.mono-project.com/Release_Notes_Mono_2.10#Google_Native_Client_Support\">Google Native Client</a> is pretty cool too. Also, I know that poor GUI performance for desktop Java apps is supposed to be a thing of the past but I keep finding slow ones. Then again, I could say the same for WPF. GTK# is plenty fast though so there is no reason they have to be slow.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Issue: Java has a larger ecosystem of libraries available.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer: Probably true, but it is a non-issue in practice.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Practically every Java library (including the JDK) runs just dandy on .NET/Mono thanks to <a href=\"http://www.ikvm.net/\">IKVM.NET</a>. This piece of technology is a true marvel. The integration is amazing; you can use a Java library just like it was native. I have only had to use Java libraries in one .NET app though. The .NET/Mono ecosystem generally offers more than I need.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Issue: Java has better (broader) tools support</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer: Not on Windows. Otherwise I agree. MonoDevelop is nice though.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I want to give a shout-out to <a href=\"http://monodevelop.com/\">MonoDevelop</a>; it is a jewel. MonoDevelop integrates most of the tools I want use including code completion (intellisense), Git/Subversion integration, support for unit tests, SQL integration, debugging, easy refactoring, and assembly browsing with on-the-fly decompilation. It is wonderful to use the same environment for everything from server-side web to mobile apps.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Issue: Compatibility across platforms.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer: Mono is a single code-base across all platforms, including Windows.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Develop for Mono first and deploy to .NET on Windows if you like. If you compare .NET from MS to Java though then Java has the edge in terms of consistency across platforms. See next answer...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Issue: Mono lags .NET.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer: No it does not.</strong> IMHO, this is an often stated but incorrect statement.</p>\n\n<p>The Mono distribution from Xamarin ships with C#, VB.NET, F#, IronPython, IronRuby, and I think maybe Boo out of the box. The Mono C# compiler is completely up to date with MS. The Mono VB.NET compiler does lag the MS version. The other compilers are the same on both platforms (as are other .NET languages like Nemerle, Boo, and Phalanger (PHP) ).</p>\n\n<p>Mono ships with a lot of the actual Microsoft written code including the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR), Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF), F#, and ASP.NET MVC. Because Razor is not Open Source, Mono currently ships with MVC2 but MVC3 works on Mono just fine.</p>\n\n<p>The core Mono platform has kept pace with .NET or many years and the compatibility is impressive. You can use the full C# 4.0 language and even some C# 5.0 features today. In fact, Mono often leads .NET in many ways.</p>\n\n<p>Mono implements parts of the CLR spec that even Microsoft does not support (like 64 bit arrays). One of the most exciting new pieces of technology in the .NET world is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Roslyn\">Rosylyn</a>. Mono has offered the C# compiler as a service for many years. Some of what Rosylyn offers is available via <a href=\"http://wiki.sharpdevelop.net/NRefactory.ashx\">NRefractory</a> as well. An example of were Mono is still ahead would be the SIMD instructions to accelerate gaming performance.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft does offer a number of products on top of .NET that are not available in Mono which is were the misconception about Mono lagging comes from. Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Entity Framework (EF), WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) are examples of products which do not work, or are poorly supported, on Mono. The obvious solution is to use cross-platform alternatives like GTK#, NHibernate, and ServiceStack instead.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Issue: Microsoft is evil.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer: True. So what.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many people offer the following reasons to avoid using Mono:</p>\n\n<p>1) You should not use Mono because Microsoft tech should be avoided</p>\n\n<p>2) Mono sucks because it does not let you use every technology that Microsoft offers</p>\n\n<p>To me, it is clear that these statements are incompatible. I reject the first statement but will skip that argument here. The second statement is true of all .NET alternatives.</p>\n\n<p>The JVM is a great platform and the explosion of JVM languages is awesome. Use what makes you happy. For now, that is often .NET/Mono for me.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(9103711,'A',25765,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2012-02-01 21:34:00',NULL,'E','','<p>You could have a look at newly announced <a href=\"http://stoffe.deephacks.org/2012/02/01/tools4j-config/\" rel=\"nofollow\">tools4j-config</a> whose mission statement is to allow you to easily handle configuration at runtime.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(9120988,'A',22816,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2012-02-02 22:29:00',NULL,'E','','<p>I was also looking for a charting library for an Eclipse RCP app, stumbled on Caleb\'s post here and can definitely recommend SWTChart now myself.

After all, by the point the constructor fails its <code>name</code> field member has already being initialized, right?</p>\n\n<p>Java does not do that because the object was not successfully built. The object is in a inconsistent state, and it is therefore discarded by Java. Your variable A is not even initialized, it is kept as null. </p>\n\n<p>Now, as you know, to fully build a new object, all its super classes must be initialized first. If one of the super classes failed to build, what would be the final state of the object? It is impossible to determine that.</p>\n\n<p>Look at this more elaborate example</p>\n\n<pre><code>class A {\n   private final int a;\n   public A() throws Exception { \n      a = 10;\n   }\n}\n\nclass B extends A {\n   private final int b;\n   public B() throws Exception {\n       methodThatThrowsException(); \n       b = 20;\n   }\n}\n\nclass C extends B {\n   public C() throws Exception { super(); }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the constructor of <code>C</code> is invoked, if an exception occurs on initializing <code>B</code>, what would be the value of the final variable <code>int b</code>?</p>\n\n<p>As such, the object C cannot be created, it is bogus, it is trash, it is not fully initialized.</p>\n\n<p>For me, this explains why your code is illegal.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(10274630,'A',26458,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2012-04-23 03:59:00','2012-04-23 04:05:00','E','','<p>I recommend WindowBuilder plugin for Eclipse IDE 3.7.2 Indigo / 24 February 2012. </p>\n\n<p>Here\'s for the step-by-step installation:  <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/teachmemrxymon/java/create-java-gui-as-easy-as-visual-basic\" rel=\"nofollow\">Create Java GUI as Easy as Visual Basic</a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/f6bUp.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(10275130,'A',26458,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2012-04-23 05:14:00','2012-04-26 20:34:00','E','','<p>There are 2 that you can use (I\'ve used them both, and they are both very powerful, and easy to use):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://netbeans.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Netbeans</a> which has a built in <a href=\"http://netbeans.org/features/java/swing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gui Builder</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>or you can use:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eclipse</a> with the <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Windowbuilder</a> <a href=\"http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/windowbuilder-pro-gui-designer\" rel=\"nofollow\">plugin</a>\n<ul>\n<li>(it can be downloaded <a href=\"http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/windowbuilder-pro-gui-designer\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/download.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>)</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Personally, I prefer eclipse with <a href=\"http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/windowbuilder-pro-gui-designer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Windowbuilder</a>, but that\'s just me.

For those who don\'t have access to a copy, the question is framed as a kind of filter/test for candidates interviewing for a position requiring \"really good Java programmers.\"</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, he asks:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How would you write a program, in pure Java, that would cause the Java Virtual Machine to crash?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I\'ve programmed in Java for over 15 years, and I found this question to be both puzzling and unfair. As others have pointed out, Java, as a managed language, is specifically designed <em>not to crash</em>. Of course there are always JVM bugs, but:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>After 15+ years of production-level JREs, it\'s rare.</li>\n<li>Any such bugs are likely to be patched in the next release, so how likely are you as a programmer to run into and recall the details of the current set of JRE show-stoppers?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As others have mentioned, some native code via JNI is a sure way to crash a JRE. But the author specifically mentioned <em>in pure Java</em>, so that\'s out.</p>\n\n<p>Another option would be to feed the JRE bogus byte codes; it\'s easy enough to dump some garbage binary data to a .class file, and ask the JRE to run it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ echo \'crap crap crap\' &gt; crap.class\n$ java crap\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.ClassFormatError: Incompatible magic value 1668440432 in class file crap\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Does that count? I mean the JRE itself hasn\'t crashed; it properly detected the bogus code, reported it, and exited. </p>\n\n<p>This leaves us with the most obvious kinds of solutions such as blowing the stack via recursion, running out of heap memory via object allocations, or simply throwing <code>RuntimeException</code>. But this just causes the JRE to exit with a <code>StackOverflowError</code> or similar exception, which, again <em>is not really a crash</em>.</p>\n\n<p>So what\'s left? I\'d really love to hear what the author really had in mind as a proper solution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: Chad Fowler <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chadfowler/status/227845163031072768\" rel=\"nofollow\">responded here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>PS: it\'s an otherwise great book.

However, its pure-java version,\n  which totally translates c/c++ codes of SQLite into Java, is\n  significantly slower compared to its native version, which uses SQLite\n  binaries compiled for each OS (win, mac, linux).</p>\n  \n  <p>To use the native version of sqlite-jdbc, user had to set a path to\n  the native codes (dll, jnilib, so files, which are JNDI C programs) by\n  using command-line arguments, e.g., -Djava.library.path=(path to the\n  dll, jnilib, etc.), or -Dorg.sqlite.lib.path, etc. This process was\n  error-prone and bothersome to tell every user to set these variables.\n  Our SQLiteJDBC library completely does away these inconveniences.</p>\n  \n  <p>Another difference is that we are keeping this SQLiteJDBC libray\n  up-to-date to the newest version of SQLite engine, because we are one\n  of the hottest users of this library. For example, SQLite JDBC is a\n  core component of UTGB (University of Tokyo Genome Browser) Toolkit,\n  which is our utility to create personalized genome browsers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong> : As usual when you update something, there will be problems in some obscure place in your code(happened to me).

In general, the rules are simple, and as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>argument constraint violations must be indicated as fast as possible (-> fast fail), in order to avoid illegal states which are much harder to debug</li>\n<li>in case of an invalid null pointer for whatever reason, throw NullPointerException</li>\n<li>in case of an illegal array/collection index, throw ArrayIndexOutOfBounds</li>\n<li>in case of a negative array/collection size, throw NegativeArraySizeException</li>\n<li>in case of an illegal argument that is not covered by the above, and for which you don\'t have another more specific exception type, throw IllegalArgumentException as a wastebasket</li>\n<li>on the other hand, in case of a constraint violation WITHIN A FIELD that could not be avoided by fast fail for some valid reason, catch and rethrow as IllegalStateException or a more specific checked exception. Never let pass the original NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBounds, etc in this case!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are at least three very good reasons against the case of mapping all kinds of argument constraint violations to IllegalArgumentException, with the third probably being so severe as to mark the practice bad style:</p>\n\n<p>(1) A programmer cannot a safely assume that all cases of argument constraint violations result in IllegalArgumentException, because the large majority of standard classes use this exception rather as a wastebasket if there is no more specific kind of exception available. Trying to map all cases of argument constraint violations to IllegalArgumentException in your API only leads to programmer frustration using your classes, as the standard libraries mostly follow different rules that violate yours, and most of your API users will use them as well!</p>\n\n<p>(2) Mapping the exceptions actually results in a different kind of anomaly, caused by single inheritance: All Java exceptions are classes, and therefore support single inheritance only. Therefore, there is no way to create an exception that is truly say both a NullPointerException and an IllegalArgumentException, as subclasses can only inherit from one or the other. Throwing an IllegalArgumentException in case of a null argument therefore makes it harder for API users to distinguish between problems whenever a program tries to programmatically correct the problem, for example by feeding default values into a call repeat!</p>\n\n<p>(3) Mapping actually creates the danger of bug masking: In order to map argument constraint violations into IllegalArgumentException, you\'ll need to code an outer try-catch within every method that has any constrained arguments. However, simply catching RuntimeException in this catch block is out of the question, because that risks mapping documented RuntimeExceptions thrown by libery methods used within yours into IllegalArgumentException, even if they are no caused by argument constraint violations. So you need to be very specific, but even that effort doesn\'t protect you from the case that you accidentally map an undocumented runtime exception of another API (i.e. a bug) into an IllegalArgumentException of your API. Even the most careful mapping therefore risks masking programming errors of other library makers as argument constraint violations of your method\'s users, which is simply hillareous behavior!</p>\n\n<p>With the standard practice on the other hand, the rules stay simple, and exception causes stay unmasked and specific. For the method caller, the rules are easy as well:\n- if you encounter a documented runtime exception of any kind because you passed an illegal value, either repeat the call with a default (for this specific exceptions are neccessary), or correct your code\n- if on the other hand you enccounter a runtime exception that is not documented to happen for a given set of arguments, file a bug report to the method\'s makers to ensure that either their code or their documentation is fixed.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(14105447,'A',40480,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2012-12-31 19:35:00',NULL,'E','','<p>Java is pass by constant reference where a copy of the reference is passed which means that it is basically a pass by value.

In general, the JVM aims to optimize more dynamic, higher-level code while the CLR gives you more low-level tools to do these kinds of optimizations yourself. </p>\n\n<p>A good example is stack allocation. On the CLR you have explicit stack allocation of custom value types. On the JVM the only custom types are reference types but the JVM can convert heap allocations to stack allocations in certain circumstances through Escape Analysis.</p>\n\n<p>Another example. In Java, methods are virtual by default. On C# at least, they are not. It is much more difficult to optimize virtual method calls because the code that gets executed at a given call site cannot be determined statically.</p>\n\n<p>Under the hood, their execution systems are quite different. Most JVMs (in particular, Hotspot) start out with a bytecode interpreter and only JIT-compile parts of the code that are executed heavily e.g. tight loops. They can also re-compile these over and over each time using execution statistics collected from previous runs to drive optimizations. This allows more optimization effort to be applied to the parts of the program that need it most. This is called adaptive optimization.</p>\n\n<p>The CLR compiles everything up-front only once. It does fewer optimization both because it has more code to compile and so has to be fast and because it doesn\'t have any statistics of the actual execution paths taken to feed into its optimizations. This approach does have the very significant advantage of allowing you to cache compilation results across processes, which CLR does but JVM does not.</p>\n\n<p>A large percentage of the Hotspot JVM code is dedicated to these adaptive optimizations and they are what put Java in the same performance ballpark as native code for most general purpose computation in the early 2000s. They are also what makes the JVM a decent target for dynamic languages. I\'m excluding here the more recent developments of the Dynamic Languages Runtime and invokedynamic as I don\'t know enough about the DLR.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(15905476,'A',39399,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2013-04-09 15:01:00',NULL,'E','','<p>Just add a filter in web.xml like</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;filter&gt;\n    &lt;filter-name&gt;customfilter&lt;/filter-name&gt;\n    &lt;filter-class&gt;com.example.CustomFilter&lt;/filter-class&gt;\n&lt;/filter&gt;\n&lt;filter-mapping&gt;\n    &lt;filter-name&gt;customfilter&lt;/filter-name&gt;\n    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;\n&lt;/filter-mapping&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And add the following code in doFilter method of that CustomFilter class</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void doFilter(ServletRequest servletRequest, ServletResponse servletResponse,\n        FilterChain filterChain) throws IOException, ServletException {\n    HttpServletRequest httpRequest = (HttpServletRequest)servletRequest;\n    HttpServletResponse httpResponse = (HttpServletResponse)servletResponse;\n    if (! httpResponse.isCommitted()) {\n        if ((httpRequest.getContextPath() + \"/\").equals(httpRequest.getRequestURI())) {\n            httpResponse.sendRedirect(httpRequest.getContextPath() + \"/MyAction\");\n        }\n        else {\n            filterChain.doFilter(servletRequest, servletResponse);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So that Filter will redirect to the action.

On one had you would like to compare two test frameworks, on the other hand you would like to implement tests easily, have natural assertions, etc...</p>\n\n<p>Ok, firstly JUnit has been playing catchup with TestNG in terms of functionality, they have bridged the gap some what with v4, but not well enough in my opinion. Things like annotations and dataproviders are still much better in TestNG. Also they are more flexible in terms of test execution, since TestNG has test dependency, grouping and ordering.</p>\n\n<p>JUnit still requires certain before/after methods to be static, which limits what you can do prior to the running of tests, TestNG never has this issue.</p>\n\n<p>TBH, mostly the differences between the two frameworks don\'t mean much, unless your focusing on integration/automation testing. JUnit from my experience is built from the ground up for unit testing and is now being pushed towards higher levels of testing, which IMO makes it the wrong tool for the job. TestNG does well at unit testing and due to its robust dataproviding and great test execution abilities, works even better at integration/automation test level.</p>\n\n<p>Now for what I believe is a separate issue, how to write well structured, readable and maintainable tests. Most of this I am sure you know, but things like <strong>Factory Pattern</strong>, <strong>Command Pattern</strong> and <strong>PageObjects</strong> (if your testing websites) are vital, it is very important to have a layer of abstraction between what your testing (SUT) and what the actual test is (assertions of business logic).

You need to know how (or if) the caller\'s variable can be affected by the called method. The difference between object reference and primitive variables, when passed into methods, is huge and important. To understand this section, you\'ll need to be comfortable with the assignments section covered in the first part of this chapter.\nPassing Object Reference Variables\nWhen you pass an object variable into a method, you must keep in mind that you\'re passing the object reference, and not the actual object itself. Remember that a reference variable holds bits that represent (to the underlying VM) a way to get to a specific object in memory (on the heap). More importantly, you must remember that you aren\'t even passing the actual reference variable, but rather a copy of the reference variable. A copy of a variable means you get a copy of the bits in that variable, so when you pass a reference variable, you\'re passing a copy of the bits representing how to get to a specific object. In other words, both the caller and the called method will now have identical copies of the reference, and thus both will refer to the same exact (not a copy) object on the heap.\nFor this example, we\'ll use the Dimension class from the java.awt package:</p>\n\n<pre><code>         1. import java.awt.Dimension;\n         2. class ReferenceTest {\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>3.   public static void main (String [] args) {\n4.     Dimension d = new Dimension(5,10);\n5.     ReferenceTest rt = new ReferenceTest();\n6.     System.out.println(\"Before modify() d.height = \"\n+ d.height);\n7.     rt.modify(d);\n8.     System.out.println(\"After modify() d.height = \"\n9. }\n                10.\n                11.\n                12.\n                13.   }\n                14. }</p>\n\n<p>When we run this class, we can see that the modify() method was indeed able to modify the original (and only) Dimension object created on line 4.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>            C:\\Java Projects\\Reference&gt;java ReferenceTest\n            Before modify() d.height = 10\n            dim = 11\n            After modify() d.height = 11\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Notice when the Dimension object on line 4 is passed to the modify() method, any changes to the object that occur inside the method are being made to the object whose reference was passed. In the preceding example, reference variables d and dim both point to the same object.\nDoes Java Use Pass-By-Value Semantics?\nIf Java passes objects by passing the reference variable instead, does that mean Java uses pass-by-reference for objects? Not exactly, although you\'ll often hear and read that it does. Java is actually pass-by-value for all variables running within a single VM. Pass-by-value means pass-by-variable-value. And that means, pass-by-copy-of- the-variable! (There\'s that word copy again!)\nIt makes no difference if you\'re passing primitive or reference variables, you are always passing a copy of the bits in the variable. So for a primitive variable, you\'re passing a copy of the bits representing the value. For example, if you pass an int variable with the value of 3, you\'re passing a copy of the bits representing 3. The called method then gets its own copy of the value, to do with it what it likes.</p>\n\n<p>And if you\'re passing an object reference variable, you\'re passing a copy of the bits representing the reference to an object. The called method then gets its own copy of the reference variable, to do with it what it likes. But because two identical reference variables refer to the exact same object, if the called method modifies the object (by invoking setter methods, for example), the caller will see that the object the caller\'s original variable refers to has also been changed. In the next section, we\'ll look at how the picture changes when we\'re talking about primitives.\nThe bottom line on pass-by-value: the called method can\'t change the caller\'s variable, although for object reference variables, the called method can change the object the variable referred to. What\'s the difference between changing the variable and changing the object? For object references, it means the called method can\'t reassign the caller\'s original reference variable and make it refer to a different object, or null. For example, in the following code fragment,</p>\n\n<pre><code>        void bar() {\n           Foo f = new Foo();\n           doStuff(f);\n        }\n        void doStuff(Foo g) {\n           g.setName(\"Boo\");\n           g = new Foo();\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>reassigning g does not reassign f! At the end of the bar() method, two Foo objects have been created, one referenced by the local variable f and one referenced by\nthe local (argument) variable g. Because the doStuff() method has a copy of the reference variable, it has a way to get to the original Foo object, for instance to call the setName() method. But, the doStuff() method does not have a way to get to the f reference variable. So doStuff() can change values within the object f refers to, but doStuff() can\'t change the actual contents (bit pattern) of f. In other words, doStuff() can change the state of the object that f refers to, but it can\'t make f refer to a different object!\nPassing Primitive Variables\nLet\'s look at what happens when a primitive variable is passed to a method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>               class ReferenceTest {\n                  public static void main (String [] args) {\n      int a = 1;\n      ReferenceTest rt = new ReferenceTest();\n      System.out.println(\"Before modify() a = \" + a);\n      rt.modify(a);\n      System.out.println(\"After modify() a = \" + a);\n    }\n    void modify(int number) {\n      number = number + 1;\n      System.out.println(\"number = \" + number);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this simple program, the variable a is passed to a method called modify(),\nwhich increments the variable by 1. The resulting output looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  Before modify() a = 1\n  number = 2\n  After modify() a = 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice that a did not change after it was passed to the method. Remember, it was a copy of a that was passed to the method. When a primitive variable is passed to a method, it is passed by value, which means pass-by-copy-of-the-bits-in-the-variable.</p>\n','',NULL,'@'),(17310303,'A',62289,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,180558595,1,180558595,0,0,0,180558595,0,2.73872e+10,0,'html','2013-06-26 01:48:00',NULL,'E','','<p>My previous edit to @David\'s answer was rejected.
