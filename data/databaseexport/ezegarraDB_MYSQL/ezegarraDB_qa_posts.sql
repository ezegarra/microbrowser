(Eclipse, Android SDK, etc). &nbsp;You will need to install three more pieces of software.<br>\n	<br>\n	The Android NDK (<a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html)</a><br>\n	Cocos2d-x (<a href=\"http://www.cocos2d-x.org/projects/cocos2d-x/wiki/Download%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cocos2d-x.org/projects/cocos2d-x/wiki/Download)</a><br>\n	Cygwin (<a href=\"http://www.cygwin.com/%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cygwin.com/)</a><br>\n	<br>\n	<br>\n	1. Extract Cocos2d-x and place its directory somewhere where you have full permissions. &nbsp;I chose c:\\Users\\\"YourAccountName\"\\.<br>\n	<br>\n	2. Extract the Android NDK to a directory where you have full permissions.<br>\n	<br>\n	3. Add those two directories to your PATH.<br>\n	<br>\n	4. If using Windows, install Cygwin with gcc, g++, GNU Make, and GNU AWK.<br>\n	If using MAC, install gcc, g++, GNU Make and GNU AWK via Xcode (if not already installed).<br>\n	<br>\n	5. In your Cocos2d-x directory, find \"create-android-project.bat\" (Windows) or \"create-android-project.sh (Unix). &nbsp;Edit this script\'s references to the the Cygwin\\bin, Android SDK tools, and NDK directories so they match your setup. &nbsp;Its comments will guide you.<br>\n	<br>\n	6. Now you can run \"create-android-project.bat\" to create an android project. It will ask for a package name, project name, and target Android SDK installation. &nbsp;The project directory will be created in the Cocos2d-x directory and it will be named after your project.<br>\n	<br>\n	7. Once the project creation script finishes, you can compile the native c++ code located in projectdirectory/Classes and in projectdirectory/Android/jni/helloworld by using the build_native.sh script. &nbsp;To do this in Windows, open Cygwin, navigate to your project\'s \"android\" directory, and type \"./build_native.sh\" to run the script.<br>\n	<br>\n	8. When this script completes, import your project into Eclipse. &nbsp;Do this by creating a new Android project, select \"Create from existing source\" and set the location as your project\'s \"android\" directory.</span></span><br>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n	9. In Eclipse, you\'ll notice some errors in a couple of the source files for org.cocos2dx.lib.&nbsp; You need to remove the Overrides.&nbsp; An easy way to do this is open each file, ctrl+f to find \"Override\" then Replace All with \"//Override\".</p>\n<p>\n	<br>\n	<span class=\"qa-c-item-content\"><span class=\"entry-content\">10. Now you should be good to go.&nbsp; Run the project in Eclipse and you will see the Cocos2d-x logo in the emulator.<br>\n	<br>\n	<br>\n	Additional Notes:<br>\n	<br>\n	Permissions issues:<br>\n	If you run into permissions issues, don\'t try to manually correct permissions as they come up. &nbsp;You will have to correct them everytime a file is created or overwritten by the scripts. &nbsp;Instead alleviate the entire issue by putting the NDK and Cocos2d-x directories where you have full permissions, such as your user directory.<br>\n	<br>\n	Can\'t delete a directory or file in Windows:<br>\n	Use Cygwin to delete the file or directory (rm or rmdir commands).<br>\n	<br>\n	\"awk.exe is outdated\" error:</span></span><br>\n	<span class=\"qa-c-item-content\"><span class=\"entry-content\">This is fixed in version 7b.&nbsp; If you can\'t update, go to android-ndk\\prebuilt\\windows\\bin and rename \"awk.exe\" to \"awk_old.exe\".&nbsp; Renaming it hides it from a script and causes cygwin to fallback to a built in version that works.</span></span></p>\n<p>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n	Black screen in emulator:</p>\n<p>\n	It\'s a bug in the 2.2 emulator.&nbsp; Create a new avd using 2.3 or later.</p>',NULL,'@'),(242,'C',241,6,5,6,NULL,0,NULL,75,NULL,1283313715,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,0,NULL,0,'','2012-02-18 05:29:59',NULL,NULL,'Android NDK 7b was just released the past day or so.

When you need to refer to a position on the screen, derive it from the relative size/location of the screen. e.g.\n\n  moving_ball ->setPosition(ccp(3*s.width/4, 4*s.height/7));\n\n3.
